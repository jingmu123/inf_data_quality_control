This view of the aortic root optimizes the evaluation of aortic insufficiency. Placement of the catheter in the ascending aorta prior to the great vessels demonstrates the aortic arch and the origin of the vessels which is useful in planing the approach prior to percutaneous revascularization of these vessels. Dissection of the ascending aorta as well as some visualization of anomalous coronary origins. Some operators prefer to engage saphenous bypass grafts in this projection.\n【3】 The RAO projection is optimal for left ventriculography (30 degrees RAO and 0 degrees cranial) and visualization of saphenous grafts.\n【4】 ## Technique\n【5】 A 4-6 F pigtail catheter is generally used to perform aortography. However, any non-end hole catheter may be used to perform the procedure. End hole catheters may risk aortic dissection or aortic valve damage during power injection. For aortic insufficiency quantification and bypass/anomalous vessel origination, the catheter is placed in the aortic root approximately 2 cm above the aortic valve. To delineate the great vessels, the catheter is placed proximal to the origin of the innominate artery. To optimize the origins of the vessels, the amount of LAO angulation is adjusted to maximize the elongation of the arch and the vessels.\n【6】 ## Settings\n【7】 Optimal aortography requires the use of a power injector to adequately opacify and fill the aorta. Adjustable settings on the power injector include pressure and flow rates, volume, rate of pressure rise. Each patient may require slight variation in the settings based on the size of the root and the presence of any aneurysmal dilatation or insufficiency, catheter type and patient size. Generally, 20-25 ml/sec for 40-50 cc will be sufficient to image a normal aorta.\n【8】 A rate of rise of 0.4 cc/sec should prevent forward lunging of the catheter. The pressure rate setting is typically 600 psi for a 6 F, 900 psi for a 5 F system and 1200 psi for a 4F system. Careful attention is required to remove air from the injector system prior to use to prevent catastrophic air embolism during aortograpahy.\n【9】 # Quantification of Aortic Insufficiency\n【10】 The pigtail catheter is placed a few centimeters above the aortic root.  Grading the amount of aortic regurgitation is based on the amount of opacification of the ventricle 2 complete cardiac cycles after injection compared to that of the aortic root.\n【11】 ## Normal (No Regurgitation)\n【12】 There is no sign of ventricular opacification during and after contrast injection to aortic root.\n【13】 ## Grade 1\n【14】 Brief and incomplete ventricular opacification. Clears rapidly.\n【15】 ## Grade 2\n【16】 Moderate opacification of the ventricle that clears in less that 2 cycles. Never greater than aortic root opacification. Video below shows grade 2 aortic insufficiency in patient with marfan syndrome.\n【17】 ## Grade 3\n【18】 Opacification of the ventricle equal to aortic root opacification within 2 cycles. Delayed clearing of ventricle over several cycles.\n【19】 ## Grade 4\n【20】 Opacification of the ventricle almost immediately that is greater than that of the aortic root with delayed clearing of the ventricle.\n【21】 # Additional Reading\n【22】 \n【23】 # Related Chapters\n【24】 - Aortic insufficiency\n【25】 - Aortic stenosis\n【26】 - Aorta\n", "seq_id": 26494, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#21#26#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 19:24:48"}

One such vaccine was recently licensed, ACEL-IMUNE. - This vaccine is licensed for use only as the fourth and fifth doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination; it is not licensed for the initial three-dose series in infants and children, regardless of age. At least one other DTaP product is anticipated to be licensed in the future for use as the fourth and fifth doses. The current Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis issued August 8, 1991, gives general recommendations on pertussis prevention, including the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccines for primary and booster vaccination .# INTRODUCTION Current Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccines\n【1】 Simultaneous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy and childhood has been a routine practice in the United States since the late 1940s. Whole-cell pertussis vaccines in the United States have been and continue to be prepared from suspensions of inactivated or disrupted Bordetella pertussis whole bacterial cells. Routine vaccination with whole-cell pertussis vaccines has been highly effective in reducing the burden of disease and deaths due to pertussis . Although the efficacy of each whole-cell vaccine in use in the United States has not been precisely estimated, clear evidence of overall high efficacy is available .\n【2】 Whole-cell pertussis vaccines, although safe, are associated with a variety of adverse events, particularly local erythema, swelling and tenderness, fever, and other mild systemic events such as drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia . The general concerns about safety have led investigators to attempt to develop safer pertussis vaccines that have high efficacy.\n【3】 # Acellular Pertussis Vaccines\n【4】 # General Information\n【5】 Efforts have been under way for greater than or equal to 20 years to identify and purify the antigens of B. pertussis that can be incorporated into acellular pertussis vaccines that are protective, yet are less likely to induce reactions. In Japan, the initial impetus for the accelerated development of acellular pertussis vaccines was the occurrence in 1975 of two deaths in infants within 24 hours of DTP vaccination . Routine whole-cell DTP vaccination was rapidly reintroduced in most areas but recommended for administration at age greater than or equal to 2 years. However, vaccination coverage of children decreased, and the incidence of reported pertussis increased markedly, reaching a peak in 1979. Meanwhile, efforts to purify antigens of B. pertussis were accelerated. After limited clinical studies of immunogenicity and safety, several DTaP vaccines were licensed in Japan in 1981.\n【6】 Since 1981, methods of purifying the antigenic components of B. pertussis have continued to improve, additional information on the protection of various antigens in animal models has accumulated, and candidate vaccines have been developed by many multinational manufacturers. Current candidate vaccines contain one or more of the bacterial components thought to provide protection. These components include filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertussis toxin (PT -- known as lymphocytosis promoting-factor, which is inactivated to a toxoid when included in a vaccine), a recently identified 69-kilodalton outer-membrane protein (pertactin; Pn), and agglutinogens of at least two types (fimbriae (Fim) types 2 and . Several studies, relating to the immunogenicity and the safety of various candidate acellular pertussis vaccines, are currently being conducted or have been completed among children in the United States and other countries. In general, these vaccines, which are immunogenic, are less likely to cause common adverse reactions than the current whole-cell preparations .\n【7】 The efficacy of two acellular pertussis vaccines developed by the Japanese National Institute of Health (JNIH) was studied during the period 1985 through 1987 in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Sweden, a country in which pertussis vaccine had not been used routinely since 1979 . One vaccine (known in the trial as JNIH- contained 23.4 ug/dose each of pertussis toxoid and FHA. Another vaccine (JNIH-, not similar to any vaccine used in Japan, contained only 37.7 ug/dose of pertussis toxoid. The 3,801 children who participated in this trial were randomly selected to receive two doses of an acellular pertussis vaccine (approximately 1,420 children in each vaccine group) or a placebo (954 children). Neither of the vaccines nor the placebo contained diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. The first dose of vaccine or placebo was administered to children 5-11 months of age; the second dose was administered 8-12 weeks later. Each vaccine demonstrated some degree of efficacy. For culture-confirmed disease with cough of any duration, the observed efficacy was 69% for JNIH-6 (95% confidence interval (CI), 47%-82%) and 54% for JNIH-7 (95% CI, 26%-72%) . Levels of estimated efficacy were higher against culture-confirmed pertussis that was more severe and classic. The efficacy of JNIH-6 was 79% (95% CI, 57%-90%) and that of JNIH-7 was 80% (95% CI, 59%-91%) against culture-confirmed pertussis with cough lasting more than 30 days. However, direct comparisons with whole-cell pertussis vaccine were not available to determine whether one or both of these acellular vaccines conferred protection at least equivalent to that of whole-cell vaccine. This trial  demonstrated that the complexities of evaluating pertussis vaccine efficacy had changed substantially depending upon the case definition used . Specific serologic correlates of immunity were not identified in this study. It remains undetermined which vaccine components are most effective in inducing protection and which types of immune responses are most responsible for protection. During the trial, four participants died of invasive bacterial disease that occurred up to 5 months after vaccination. Three had received the JNIH-6 vaccine and one had received JNIH-7 vaccine; the significance of these findings is uncertain . Primarily because of concerns regarding the level of efficacy of the vaccine following vaccination, neither vaccine is licensed for use in Sweden .\n【8】 Until now, acellular pertussis vaccines have been licensed for use only in Japan, where, since 1981, such vaccines have been administered routinely to children greater than or equal to 2 years of age . Studies of persons exposed to pertussis in household settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of several acellular pertussis vaccines manufactured in Japan in preventing clinical pertussis among children greater than or equal to 2 years of age (8,. In Japan, with the continued use of acellular pertussis vaccines, the incidence of disease and death caused by pertussis has declined steadily. However, the reported incidence among children age less than 2 years has remained higher than the incidence among children of that age when whole-cell vaccines were routinely used in infants . Since 1989, vaccination of infants with Dtap beginning at 3 months of age has been initiated in many areas of Japan at the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. However, the extent of use among children less than 2 years of age remains low (S. Isomura, personal communication, . Therefore, it is too soon to make conclusions about the effect of this policy on the age-specific incidence of pertussis among children less than 2 years of age.\n【9】 Based on the experiences in Sweden and Japan, questions remain whether acellular pertussis vaccines confer clinical protection when administered early in infancy, or whether protection induced at any age is equivalent to that of whole-cell pertussis vaccine preparations. Consistent with the licensure of Dtap, the Committee recommends that whole-cell pertussis vaccine be continued for the initial three-dose vaccination series until an alternative vaccine is available that has demonstrated essentially equivalent or higher efficacy. To evaluate the relative protective efficacy of primary vaccination among infants, several clinical trials, which will compare Dtap vaccine with whole-cell DTP vaccine, are in progress or development.\n【10】 # ACEL-IMUNE Information\n【11】 On December 17, 1991, the FDA licensed one Dtap vaccine for use as the fourth and fifth doses of the recommended DTP series. ACEL-IMUNE contains 40 mcg of protein; approximately 86% of this protein is FHA; 8%, PT; 4%, Pn; and 2%, Fim type 2. The acellular pertussis vaccine component is purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation; PT is detoxified by treatment with formaldehyde. Each dose of ACEL-IMUNE contains 7.5 limit of flocculation (Lf) of diphtheria toxoid, 5.0 Lf of tetanus toxoid, and 300 hemagglutinating (HA) units of acellular pertussis vaccine. The FHA and PT components both exhibit HA activity. The combined components are adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate and preserved with 1:10,000 thimerosal.\n【12】 Household exposure studies have demonstrated efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccines among children in Japan vaccinated at age greater than or equal to 2 years with the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine component, combined with Takeda-produced diphtheria and tetanus toxoids . Clinical studies are in progress to examine the relative efficacy of ACEL-IMUNE in preventing disease when administered to infants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months compared with whole-cell DTP vaccine. The following evidence supports the use of ACEL-IMUNE after the initial infant three-dose series of whole-cell DTP vaccine.\n【13】 # Immunogenicity.\n【14】 When ACEL-IMUNE is used for the fourth and fifth doses of the vaccination series, antibody responses after administration are generally similar to those following whole-cell DTP vaccine for the PT, Pn, and Fim components; antibody responses are higher for FHA  .\n【15】 # Clinical efficacy.\n【16】 In Japan, Takeda-manufactured Dtap vaccine has been shown to prevent pertussis disease among children age greater than or equal to 2 years, however, in this retrospective study clinicians and investigators were not blinded to the vaccination status of the participants . The occurrence of pertussis was compared in 62 children vaccinated with two to four doses of Takeda DTaP on or after the second birthday and 62 unvaccinated children for the period 7-30 days after household exposure to pertussis. Typical clinical pertussis occurred in one vaccinated child and 43 unvaccinated children; estimated clinical vaccine efficacy: 98% (95% CI, 84%-99%). Minor respiratory illness-possibly representing mild, atypical pertussis-occurred among an additional eight vaccinated and four unvaccinated children. When these children were included, the estimated vaccine efficacy was 81% (95% CI, 64%-90%). None of the vaccinated household contacts in this study were age less than 2 years; by restricting the analysis of results to household contacts who were age greater than or equal to 2 years, the corresponding estimates of efficacy were 97% (95% CI, 82%-99%) and 79% (95% CI, 60%-89%) respectively. In a smaller study of similar design, results were similar .\n【17】 # Safety.\n【18】 Local reactions, fever, and other common systemic events occur less frequently after receipt of ACEL-IMUNE vaccinations than after whole-cell DTP vaccination. In general, local and common systemic events occur approximately one-fourth to two-thirds the frequency after whole-cell DTP vaccination  . Available data indicate comparable safety for ACEL-IMUNE and Takeda DTaP packaged in Japan.\n【19】 # VACCINE USAGE\n【20】 the general ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis for more details . This vaccine is licensed only for use as the fourth and fifth doses of the DTP series among children ages 15 months through 6 years of age (before the seventh birthday). Use of DTaP is not recommended for children who have received less than three doses of whole-cell DTP, regardless of age. The Committee considers the first four DTP doses as primary immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The fourth (reinforcing) dose of DTP, generally given at age 15-18 months, is administered to maintain adequate pertussis immunity during the preschool years. The fifth (booster) dose of DTP is administered at ages 4-6 years of age to confer continued protection against exposure during the early years of school.\n【21】 Either whole-cell DTP or DTaP can be used interchangeably for the fourth and fifth doses of the routine series of vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis among children greater than or equal to 15 months of age. The Committee recommends the use of DTaP, if readily available, because it substantially reduces local reactions, fever, and other common systemic events that often follow receipt of whole-cell DTP.\n【22】 The standard, single-dose volume of ACEL-IMUNE is 0.5 mL and should be administered intramuscularly (IM).\n【23】 # Indications for the Fourth (Reinforcing) Dose\n【24】 Six to 12 months after the third dose of DTP One dose of DTaP (instead of whole-cell DTP) can be administered IM to children age 15-18 months (or later when necessary); this dose should be administered at least 6 months after the third dose of whole-cell DTP . The fourth dose of either DTaP or DTP is an integral part of the primary immunizing course of pertussis vaccination. DTaP is not licensed for use among children age less than 15 months. Although immunogenicity data among children age 15-16 months are not yet available for ACEL-IMUNE, the Committee suggests that ACEL-IMUNE be used for children as part of the recommended schedule of routine simultaneous vaccination with DTP, oral poliovirus (OPV), and measles-mumpsrubella (MMR) at age 15-18 months .\n【25】 # Booster Vaccination\n【26】 Children 4-6 years of age (up to the seventh birthday)\n【27】 A dose of DTaP can be administered as the fifth dose in the series for children ages 4-6 years who either have received all four prior doses as whole-cell vaccine or for those children who have received three doses of whole-cell DTP and one dose of DTaP. A fifth dose of either DTaP or DTP should be administered before the child enters kindergarten or elementary school. The Committee recommends the use of DTaP, if readily available. This fifth dose is not necessary if the fourth dose in the series is given on or after the fourth birthday.\n【28】 # Special Considerations\n【29】 # Vaccination of infants and young children who have a personal or family history of seizures\n【30】 Recent data suggest that infants and young children who have had previous seizures (whether febrile or nonfebrile) or who have immediate family members with such histories are at increased risk of seizures following DTP vaccination than those without such histories . Because these reactions may be due to the fever induced by whole-cell DTP vaccine and because DTaP is infrequently associated with moderate to high fever, use of DTaP is strongly recommended for the fourth and fifth doses if pertussis vaccination is considered for these children  Precautions and Contraindications). A family history of seizures or other central nervous disorders does not justify withholding pertussis vaccination. Acetaminophen should be given at the time of DTP or DTaP vaccination and every 4 hours for 24 hours to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever in these children.\n【31】 # Children with a contraindication to pertussis vaccination  Precautions and Contraindications)\n【32】 For children younger than age 7 years who have a contraindication to whole-cell pertussis vaccine, DT should be used instead of DTP; DTaP should not be substituted. If additional doses of pertussis vaccine become contraindicated after a DTP series is begun in the first year of life, DT should be substituted for each remaining scheduled DTP dose.\n【33】 # Pertussis vaccination for persons age greater than or equal to 7 years\n【34】 Adolescents and adults who have waning immunity are a major reservoir for transmission of pertussis . It is possible that booster doses of other preparations of acellular pertussis vaccines will be recommended in the future for persons age greater than or equal to 7 years, although it is not currently recommended.\n【35】 # SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS\n【36】 For a complete discussion, see the general ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis .\n【37】 Although mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur frequently after both whole-cell DTP vaccination and ACEL-IMUNE vaccination, they are less common after ACEL-IMUNE vaccination . These reactions are self-limited and can be safely managed with symptomatic treatment.\n【38】 Moderate-to-severe systemic events, including fever greater than or equal to 40.5 C (105 F); persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more; and collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) have been rarely reported after vaccination with DTaP . Each of these events appears to occur less often than with whole-cell DTP. When these events occur after the administration of whole-cell DTP, they appear to be without sequelae; the limited experience with DTaP suggests a similar outcome. In U.S. studies, more severe neurologic events, such as prolonged convulsions or encephalopathy, have not been reported in temporal association after administration of approximately 6,500 doses of ACEL-IMUNE. This somewhat limited experience does not allow conclusions to be drawn whether any rare serious adverse events will occur after administration of DTaP. Because DTaP causes fever less frequently than whole-cell DTP, it is anticipated that events such as febrile convulsions will be less common after receiving DTaP.\n【39】 # SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES\n【40】 The simultaneous administration of DTaP, OPV, and MMR has not been evaluated. However, on the basis of studies using whole-cell DTP, the Committee does not anticipate any differences in seroconversion rates and rates of side effects from those observed when the vaccines are administered separately. Although combinations have not been thoroughly studied, simultaneous vaccination with DTaP, MMR, OPV, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) is acceptable; similarly, simultaneous vaccination with DTaP, hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), OPV, IPV, and HbCV is  acceptable. The Committee recommends the simultaneous administration of all vaccines appropriate to the age and the previous vaccination status of the child , including the special circumstance of simultaneous administration of DTP or DTaP, OPV, HbCV, and MMR at age greater than or equal to 15 months.\n【41】 # PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS General Considerations\n【42】 DTaP is licensed only for reinforcing and booster immunization --the fourth and fifth doses in the DTP series. DTaP is not licensed for use among children age less than 15 months, on or after the seventh birthday, or for the initial three-dose series among infants and children regardless of their age.\n【43】 # Contraindications\n【44】 Because no data currently exist to suggest otherwise, contraindications to further doses of DTaP are the same as those for the whole-cell DTP. If any of the following events occurs in temporal relation with the administration of DTP or DTaP, subsequent vaccination with DTP or DTaP is contraindicated:\n【45】 1. An immediate anaphylactic reaction.\n【46】 2. Encephalopathy (not due to another identifiable cause), defined as an acute, severe central nervous system disorder occurring within 7 days after vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, or generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, without recovery within 24 hours.\n【47】 # Precautions (Warnings)\n【48】 If any of the following events occurs in temporal relation with the receipt of either whole-cell DTP or DTaP, the decision to administer subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. Although these events were once considered absolute contraindications to wholecell DTP, there may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, in which the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks, particularly since the following events have not been proven to cause permanent sequelae:\n【49】 1. Temperature of greater than or equal to 40.5 C (105 F) within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause.\n【50】 2. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours.\n【51】 3. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting greater than or equal to 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours.\n【52】 4. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days.\n【53】 If these events occur after receipt of any of the first four doses of whole-cell DTP vaccine and if additional doses of pertussis vaccine are indicated because the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, consideration should be given to the use of DTaP for the fourth and fifth doses.\n【54】 # REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AFTER VACCINATION\n【55】 As with any newly licensed vaccine, surveillance for information regarding the safety of DTaP in largescale use is important. Surveillance information aids in the assessment of vaccine safety, although its usefulness is limited, by identifying potential events that may warrant further study. Additionally, specific evaluations of DTaP use in larger populations than those studied for license application are being initiated.\n【56】 The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of the Department of Health and Human Services became operational in November, 1990. VAERS is designed to accept reports of all serious adverse events that occur after receipt of DTaP, as well as any other vaccine, including but not limited to those mandated by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 . Any questions about reporting requirements, completion of the report form, or requests for reporting forms can be directed to 1-800-822-7967.\n【57】 Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed is prepared and distributed as ACEL-IMUNE by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, New York) and was licensed December 17, 1991 .

Clinicians should therefore ensure that patients understand the uncertainties and the alternative treatment options. Use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\n【4】 Further research and audit should address quality of life, clinical outcomes and long-term survival.# The procedure\n【5】 # Indications\n【6】 Cryotherapy may be used to treat locally recurrent carcinoma of the prostate that has been refractory to other treatments, such as radiotherapy or hormone therapy.\n【7】 Treatment options for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy are limited and include salvage radical prostatectomy, salvage cryotherapy and salvage brachytherapy.\n【8】 # Outline of the procedure\n【9】 Cryotherapy may be performed under general or spinal anaesthesia. A warming catheter is initially inserted into the urethra to prevent it being damaged by the cold. Cryoneedles or probes are inserted into the prostate, using imaging for guidance. Temperature monitor probes may  be placed percutaneously through the perineum. Argon gas is then circulated through these needles or probes, generating very low temperatures and causing the formation of ice around the prostate gland which destroys the affected tissue. Newer cryotherapy techniques allow these needles to be removed or repositioned so that the frozen zone conforms to the exact size and shape of the target tissue. After the procedure, a suprapubic catheter is inserted and left in place for 1–2 weeks, depending on the post-void residual urine volume.\n【10】 # Efficacy\n【11】 Various efficacy outcome measures were used in the studies identified, making comparisons of efficacy across studies difficult. A frequently used marker was PSA, a protein produced by both normal and cancerous cells in the prostate gland. Reduction in the PSA level is used as a marker for ablation of malignant tissue in studies of prostate cancer treatment, together with negative prostatic biopsies.\n【12】 In one study, lowest level PSA < 0.5 ng/ml was reported in 97% (114/ of patients who had undergone cryotherapy; in another study, a level of < 0.1 ng/ml was reported in 60% (26/ of patients. These studies included patients with recurrent prostate cancer or rising PSA levels, and those who were undergoing salvage therapy. After medial retropubic prostatectomy, PSA levels are expected to be < 0.1 ng/ml.\n【13】 In a study of 43 patients, biochemical-recurrence-free survival (recurrence defined as an increase in PSA level of > 0.2 ng/ml above nadir) was reported as 79% at 6 months and 66% at 12 months; and in a study of 38 patients (recurrence defined as an increase in PSA level of > 0.3 ng/ml above nadir), as 86% at 12 months and 74% at 24 months. One case series reported negative biopsy in 100% (38/ of patients followed up for a median 82 months. Another case series reported negative biopsies in 79% (87/ of patients at 6-month follow-up. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\n【14】 # Safety\n【15】 Complication rates varied substantially among the studies and there is some evidence to suggest that complications have decreased with improvements in technique and instrumentation. Among the studies identified, the following complications were reported: impotence in 72% (108/ and 86% (12/ of patients; incontinence in 8% (3/ of patients; and perineal and/or rectal pain in 18% (27/ to 39% (15/ of patients. Other reported complications from the case series included fistula formation in 1% (2/ to 3% (4/118 and 2/ of patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\n【16】 The Specialist Advisors listed the main complications as urinary incontinence, impotence, rectal injury and fistula formation. However, severe complications are rare and comparison needs to be made with the complication rates in alternative options.\n【17】 # Other comments\n【18】 In recommending that further research and audit should address long-term survival, it is noted that prostate cancer patients frequently die from unrelated causes.\n【19】 There are different types of cryotherapy device, and these may have different safety profiles.\n【20】 The technology for this procedure is continuing to evolve.# Other NICE recommendations on cryotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer\n【21】 Further recommendations have been made as part of the clinical guideline on prostate cancer published in February 2008, as follows:\n【22】 High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy are not recommended for men with localised prostate cancer other than in the context of controlled clinical trials comparing their use with established interventions.\n【23】 Clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence was reviewed in the development of this guideline which has led to this more specific recommendation. More information on prostate cancer diagnosis and management is available. The IP guidance on cryotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer remains current, and should be read in conjunction with the clinical guideline.# Further information\n【24】 NICE has issued guidance on urological cancer services, which includes prostate cancer. The Institute has  issued interventional procedures guidance on laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and high-intensity ultrasound for prostate cancer.\n【25】 of evidence\n【26】 The following document, which summarises the evidence, was considered by the Institute when making its recommendations.\n【27】 Interventional procedure overview of cryotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer, June 2004.\n【28】 # Information for patients\n【29】 NICE has produced information on this procedure for the patients and carers.

It was discontinued in most of the world in the 1960s, but remained in use in France up until fairly recently.\n【3】 Iproniazid was originally developed for the treatment of tuberculosis, but in 1952, its antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that patients given isoniazid became inappropriately happy. Subsequently N-isopropyl addition lead to development as an antidepressant and was approved for use in 1958. It was withdrawn a few years later in 1961 due to a high incidence of hepatitis, and was replaced by less hepatotoxic drugs such as phenelzine and isocarboxazid.\n【4】 Although iproniazid was one of the first antidepressants ever marketed, amphetamine (marketed as Benzedrine from 1935, for \"mild depression\", amid other indications) predates it; and frankincense has been marketed traditionally for millennia for, among other things, altering mood, although it was not until 2012 that one of the components of its smoke was found to have antidepressant effects in mice.\n【5】 # Synthesis\n【6】 Condensation of isoniazid with acetone at the basic nitrogen gives the corresponding Schiff base.

Ancobon is not metabolized significantly when given orally to man. Bioavailability estimated by comparing the area under the curve of serum concentrations after oral and intravenous administration showed 78% to 89% absorption of the oral dose. Peak serum concentrations of 30 to 40 µg/mL were reached within 2 hours of administration of a 2 g oral dose to normal subjects. Other studies revealed mean serum concentrations of approximately 70 to 80 μg/mL 1 to 2 hours after a dose in patients with normal renal function receiving a 6-week regimen of flucytosine (150 mg/kg/day given in divided doses every 6 hours) in combination with amphotericin B. The half-life in the majority of healthy subjects ranged between 2.4 and 4.8 hours. Flucytosine is excreted via the kidneys by means of glomerular filtration without significant tubular reabsorption. More than 90% of the total radioactivity after oral administration was recovered in the urine as intact drug. Flucytosine is deaminated (probably by gut bacteria) to 5-fluorouracil. The area under the curve (AUC) ratio of 5-fluorouracil to flucytosine is 4%. Approximately 1% of the dose is present in the urine as the α-fluoro-β-ureido-propionic acid metabolite. A small portion of the dose is excreted in the feces.\n【3】 The half-life of flucytosine is prolonged in patients with renal insufficiency; the average half-life in nephrectomized or anuric patients was 85 hours (range: 29.9 to 250 hours). A linear correlation was found between the elimination rate constant of flucytosine and creatinine clearance.\n【4】 In vitro studies have shown that 2.9% to 4% of flucytosine is protein-bound over the range of therapeutic concentrations found in the blood. Flucytosine readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, achieving clinically significant concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid.\n【5】 ## Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients\n【6】 Limited data are available regarding the pharmacokinetics of Ancobon administered to neonatal patients being treated for systemic candidiasis. After five days of continuous therapy, median peak levels in infants were 19.6 µg/mL, 27.7 µg/mL, and 83.9 µg/mL at doses of 25 mg/kg (N=, 50 mg/kg (N=, and 100 mg/kg (N=, respectively. Mean time to peak serum levels was of 2.5 ± 1.3 hours, similar to that observed in adult patients. A good deal of interindividual variability was noted, which did not correlate with gestational age. Some patients had serum levels > 100 µg/mL, suggesting a need for drug level monitoring during therapy. In another study, serum concentrations were determined during flucytosine therapy in two patients (total assays performed =. Median serum flucytosine concentrations at steady state were calculated to be 57 ± 10 µg/mL (doses of 50 to 125 mg/kg/day, normalized to 25 mg/kg per dose for comparison). In three infants receiving flucytosine 25 mg/kg/day (four divided doses), a median flucytosine half-life of 7.4 hours was observed, approximately double that seen in adult patients. The concentration of flucytosine in the cerebrospinal fluid of one infant was 43 µg/mL 3 hours after a 25 mg oral dose, and ranged from 20 to 67 mg/L in another neonate receiving oral doses of 120 to 150 mg/kg/day.\n", "seq_id": 7953, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-17 21:45:05"}

It is commonly associated with hiatus hernia.\n【10】 Symptoms of GORD include heartburn and retrosternal chest pain, regurgitation, waterbrash, respiratory symptoms, dysphagia and odynophagia (painful swallowing).\n【11】 Mild symptoms of GORD can be managed with lifestyle modification and pharmacological therapy, which are effective in most patients. However, endoluminal gastroplication or antireflux surgery may be required for those with refractory symptoms or persistent oesophagitis.\n【12】 # Outline of the procedure\n【13】 The procedure is usually carried out under sedation on an outpatient basis. The aim is to augment the lower oesophageal sphincter mechanism by implantation of one or more prostheses. An endoscope and implant delivery mechanism (comprising a needle, trocar, dilator and delivery sheath) are inserted into an overtube – a tubular device with a shelf or notch near its tip. The overtube is guided to the gastro-oesophageal junction and suction applied, pulling a fold of the oesophageal wall into the shelf of the overtube. Saline is injected into this fold to create a space within the submucosa, and a hydrogel prosthesis is implanted. Suction is released and the overtube is rotated to the next location on the oesophageal wall. The prosthesis absorbs water and expands fully within 24 hours, bulking out the oesophageal wall.\n【14】 # Efficacy\n【15】 In one case series (n = , GORD/heartburn-related quality-of-life (GORD-HRQL) scores improved significantly, from 24 at baseline (n =  to 5 at 6 months (n = 53; p < 0..

It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【34】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【35】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Tools to help you put the guidance into practice and information about the evidence it is based on are  available.\n【36】 Your responsibility\n【37】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【38】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【39】 \n【40】 \n【41】 \n", "seq_id": 2672, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#22#22#最后一句另起一行", "type3": "无关文本#7#7#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#18#18#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#21#21#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#29#38#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:50:51"}

His thesis was submitted in the University of Leiden, entitled “Inaugural medical disputation on the disease of English children which is popularly termed the rickets”.\n【6】 - In 1650, Francis Glisson, a Cambridge physician, published a book in Latin, named “De Rachitide”. He described his careful observation of rachitic children in great detail.\n【7】 - In 1822, Sniadecki identified the association of rickets with a lack of sunlight exposure. He noted that children living in the inner city of Warshaw had a high incidence of rickets than children of the adjacent rural area.\n【8】 - In 1918, Mellanby discovered the antirachitic effect of cod liver oil.\n【9】 - In 1922, Elmer McCollum distinguished vitamin D from vitamin A. He suggested that vitamin D promotes calcium deposition.\n【10】 - By the 1930s, Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus at the University of Göttingen in Germany identified the chemical structure of the vitamin D and its precursor,  7-dehydrocholesterol. He received Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1928 for his work \"on the sterols and their relationship to other natural products\".\n【11】 ## Landmark Events in the Development of Treatment Strategies\n【12】 - In 1822, Sniadecki was the first one to recognize the importance of sun exposure for the prevention and treatment of rickets.\n【13】 - In 1890, Theobald Palm suggested using sunbaths to prevent rickets.\n【14】 - In 1918, Mellanby prevented rickets in puppies with cod liver oil.\n【15】 - In 1919, Huldschinski observed that exposing children to radiation from a lamp had a healing effect on rickets.\n【16】 - In 1921, Hess and Unger exposed seven rachitic children to sunlight in New York City for several months and reported effective improvement of their disease.\n【17】 - In the 1930s, the US government recommended to parents to expose their children to sunlight every day to prevent rickets.\n【18】 - In the 1930s, for eradication of rickets in the United States and Europe, the fortification of milk with vitamin D was started. However, an outbreak of hypercalcemia in the 1950s, in Great Britain, resulted in discontinuation of this program in Europe until now.\n", "seq_id": 5193, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 02:12:38"}

Other causes of central pontine myelinolysis may inclu\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 Central pontine myelinolysis was first discovered by Raymond Delacy Adams, an an American neurologist, in 1959. Raymond Delacy Adams and colleagues observed a rapidly evolving quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy in a young alcoholic man whose postmortem examination showed a large, symmetrical, essentially demyelinative lesion occupying the greater part of the base of the pons In 1950.\n【5】 # Pathophysiology\n【6】 It is understood that central pontine myelinolysis is caused by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. The CNS is particularly susceptible to reductions in plasma osmolarity, specially during hyponatremia which is the most commonly encountered electrolyte disturbance. When a decrease in the plasma osmolarity happens, neural cells first swell but then they are able to regain their original volume through the release of inorganic and organic osmolytes and exit of osmotically obligated water. Subsequent exposure to hypertonic stress(e.g., correction of hyponatremia with hypertonic I.V. solutions)resulting from a rapid correction of hyponatremia causes the ions to quickly re-enter the intracellular space and compels the water to follow. If the serum sodium levels rise too rapidly, the increased extracellular tonicity will continue to drive water out of the brain's cells because the brain cells do not have enough time to bring extracellular sodium into the cell, so the water goes out very fast. This can lead to cellular dysfunction and central pontine myelinolysis and finally death.\n【7】 # Causes\n【8】 The most common cause of central pontine myelinolysis is rapid correction(>48-hours duration) of hyponatremia in patients with the history of prolonged hyponatremia. Other causes of central pontine myelinolysis may inclu\n【9】 # Differentiating central pontine myelinolysis from Other Diseases\n【10】 On the basis central pontine myelinolysis must be differentiated diseases that cause acute confusion, lethargy, speech difficulties and bilateral weakness or quadriplegia such as: Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, infective encephalitis, ischemic Brain stem infarction, thalamus infarction due thrombosis of the basilar artery, diffuse hypoxic encephalopathy, metastasis to the brain and brain tumors such as glioma.\n【11】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【12】 The prevalence of central pontine myelinolysis is approximately 250–500 per 100,000 in the general population. Among hospitalized patients in the ICU the incidence of central pontine myelinolysis is approximately 2500 per 100,000 patients. Among patients undergoing liver transplantation the incidence of central pontine myelinolysis is approximately 10,000 per 100,000 patients. The case-mortality rate of central pontine myelinolysis is approximately 12%. Patients of all age groups may develop central pontine myelinolysis but the incidence of central pontine myelinolysis increases with age. There is no racial predilection to central pontine myelinolysis. Central pontine myelinolysis affects men and women equally. There is no regional predilection to central pontine myelinolysis.\n【13】 # Risk Factors\n【14】 The most potent risk factor in the development of central pontine myelinolysis is hyponatremia. Other risk factors inclu\n【15】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【16】 The symptoms of central pontine myelinolysis typically develop immediately after injury to the neurons of the brain stem. Patients, with Central Pontine Myelinolysis, may develop permanent neurological damages. Common complications of central pontine myelinolysis inclu\n【17】 # Diagnosis\n【18】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\n【19】 Brain MRI is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of central pontine myelinolysis. The following findings on performing Brain MRI are confirmatory for central pontine myelinolysis: T2 hyperintensity in the central pontine region in the axial plane and hyperintense lesion in the midpons in the midsagittal T2-weighted MRI.\n【20】 ## History and Symptoms\n【21】 Patients with central pontine myelinolysis may have a positive history of: Malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypophosphatemia secondary to refeeding syndrome and prolonged ischemia. These patients with central pontine myelinolysis most commonly have a history of rapid sodium correction, greater than 0.5-1.0 mEq/L per hour. The most susceptible patients are those with: Chronic hyponatremia (>48 hours), severe hyponatremia (Na <120 mEq/L) and both chronic hyponatremia and severe hyponatremia. Common symptoms of central pontine myelinolysis inclu\n【22】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【23】 Laboratory finding consistent with the diagnosis of central pontine myelinolysis is hypoosmotic hyponatremia and the rapid correction of hyponatremia is the cause of central pontine myelinolysis.\n【24】 ## CT scan\n【25】 Brain CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of central pontine myelinolysis. Findings on CT scan suggestive of central pontine myelinolysis inclu\n【26】 ## MRI\n【27】 Brain and spinal cord MRIs may be helpful in the diagnosis of Central pontine myelinolysis. Findings on MRI diagnostic of Central pontine myelinolysis inclu\n【28】 # Treatment\n【29】 ## Medical Therapy\n【30】 Treatment of patients with central pontine myelinolysis is mainly supportive because once the osmotic demyelination has begun, there is no cure or specific treatment. Alcoholic patients should receive vitamin supplementation including vitamin B6, B9 and B12 and evaluation of their nutritional status.\n【31】 ## Primary Prevention\n【32】 To minimize the risk of central pontine myelinolysis developing from its most common cause, overly rapid reversal of hyponatremia, the hyponatremia should be corrected slowly. The primary goals of treating hypernatremia are estimating the magnitude of water deficit, determining the proper rate of correction, addressing the concurrent electrolyte or volume deficits and calculating the fluid deficit regimen using the estimated water deficit and desired rate of correction. Correcting sodium level is vital in order to prevent any permanent brain damage.\n", "seq_id": 6355, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#2#2#与文本无关", "type4": "语义不完整#8#8#没表述完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-17 21:44:24"}

The parenteral route is indicated when oral administration is not feasible as in anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and preoperative and postoperative conditions. It is  indicated when gastrointestinal absorption is impaired.   Common adverse reactions include decreased folic acid, paresthesia and somnolence.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 - Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously.  In cases of dietary deficiency, the dosage is 10 to 20 mg daily for 3 weeks.  Follow-up treatment is recommended daily for several weeks with an oral therapeutic multivitamin preparation containing 2 to 5 mg pyridoxine.  Poor dietary habits should be corrected, and an adequate, well balanced diet should be prescribed.\n【8】 - The vitamin B6 dependency syndrome may require a therapeutic dosage of as much as 600 mg a day and a daily intake of 30 mg for life.\n【9】 - In deficiencies due to INH, the dosage is 100 mg daily for 3 weeks followed by a 30 mg maintenance dose daily.\n【10】 - In poisoning caused by ingestion of more than 10 g of INH, an equal amount of pyridoxine should be given — 4 g intravenously followed by 1 g intramuscularly every 30 minutes.\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【13】 - Dosage: 25 to 50 mg orally once daily for 9 months  in combination with Isoniazid (INH) Isoniazid 5 mg/kg/day orally or intramuscularly for 9 months (ie, for 270 doses); maximum dose, 300 mg/day\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【15】 - Dosage: 60 mg/day for 4 weeks\n【16】 - Dosage: 5 g IV diluted in 500 mL of 5% dextrose\n【17】 - Dosage: 30 milligrams/day\n【18】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【19】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【20】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【21】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【22】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【23】 - Dosage: 25 to 50 mg orally once daily for 9 months  in combination with Isoniazid (INH) Isoniazid 5 mg/kg/day orally or intramuscularly for 9 months (ie, for 270 doses); maximum dose, 300 mg/day\n【24】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【25】 - Dosage: 6 mg (4.6-10.0 US 1998 RDA).\n【26】 - Dosage\n【27】 Week 1: 100 mg/day PO q24h\n【28】 Week 2-5: 300 mg/day PO q24h\n【29】 - Week 1: 100 mg/day PO q24h\n【30】 - Week 2-5: 300 mg/day PO q24h\n【31】 # Contraindications\n【32】 - A history of sensitivity to pyridoxine or to any of the ingredients in Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is a contraindication.\n【33】 # Warnings\n【34】 - This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.\n【35】 - Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity.  Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.\n【36】 # Adverse Reactions\n【37】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【38】 - Paresthesia, somnolence, and low serum folic acid levels have been reported.\n【39】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【40】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【41】 # Drug Interactions\n【42】 - Pyridoxine supplements should not be given to patients receiving levodopa, because the action of the latter drug is antagonized by pyridoxine. However, this vitamin may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.\n【43】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【44】 ### Pregnancy\n【45】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): A\n【46】 - The requirement for pyridoxine appears to be increased during pregnancy.  Pyridoxine is sometimes of value in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.\n【47】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【48】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Pyridoxine (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n【49】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【50】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Pyridoxine (injection) during labor and delivery.\n【51】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【52】 - The need for pyridoxine is increased during lactation.  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when pyridoxine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.\n【53】 ### Pediatric Use\n【54】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in pediatric settings.\n【55】 ### Geriatic Use\n【56】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in geriatric settings.\n【57】 ### Gender\n【58】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n【59】 ### Race\n【60】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n【61】 ### Renal Impairment\n【62】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n【63】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【64】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【65】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【66】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【67】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【68】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Pyridoxine (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【69】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【70】 ### Administration\n【71】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Administration in the drug label.\n【72】 ### Monitoring\n【73】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Monitoring in the drug label.\n【74】 # IV Compatibility\n【75】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Pyridoxine (injection) and IV administrations.\n【76】 # Overdosage\n【77】 - Pyridoxine given to animals in amounts of 3 to 4 g/kg of body weight produces convulsions and death. In man, a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight is well tolerated.\n【78】 # Pharmacology\n【79】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【80】 - Natural substances that have vitamin B6 activity are pyridoxine in plants and pyridoxal or pyridoxamine in animals.  All 3 are converted to pyridoxal phosphate by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase.  The physiologically active forms of vitamin B6 are pyridoxal phosphate (codecarboxylase) and pyridoxamine phosphate.  Riboflavin is required for the conversion of pyridoxine phosphate to pyridoxal phosphate.\n【81】 Vitamin B6 acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and fat.  In protein metabolism, it participates in the decarboxylation of amino acids, conversion of tryptophan to niacin or to serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine), deamination, and transamination and transulfuration of amino acids.  In carbohydrate metabolism, it is responsible for the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.\n【82】 ## Structure\n【83】 - The chemical name is 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4,5-bis (hydroxymethyl) pyridine hydrochloride. The structural formula is:\n【84】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【85】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n【86】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【87】 - The total adult body pool consists of 16 to 25 mg of pyridoxine.  Its half-life appears to be 15 to 20 days.  Vitamin B6 is degraded to 4-pyridoxic acid in the liver.  This metabolite is excreted in the urine.\n【88】 - The need for pyridoxine increases with the amount of protein in the diet.  The tryptophan load test appears to uncover early vitamin B6 deficiency by detecting xanthinurea.  The average adult minimum daily requirement is about 1.25 mg.  The ‘‘Recommended Dietary Allowance’’ of the National Academy of Sciences is estimated to be as much as 2.2 mg for adults and 2.5 mg for pregnant and lactating women.  The requirements are more in persons having certain genetic defects or those being treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INHJ) or oral contraceptives.\n【89】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【90】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n【91】 # Clinical Studies\n【92】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n【93】 # How Supplied\n【94】 ## Storage\n【95】 - Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) .\n【96】 # Images\n【97】 ## Drug Images\n【98】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【99】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【100】 There is limited information regarding Pyridoxine (injection) Patient Counseling Information in the drug label.\n【101】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【102】 Alcohol-Pyridoxine hydrochloride interaction has not been established.

This guideline was developed by a panel of Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses convened by the RNAO and conducting its work independent of any bias or influence from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.\n【20】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e\n【21】 # Purpose and Scope\n【22】 Focusing on the family is an integral component of nursing practice. The guideline development panel acknowledges that most nurses already have relevant knowledge and skills to care for families. However, this guideline was developed to promote and facilitate continuing education, reflection and reaffirmation of the importance of caring for families.\n【23】 The intent of the guideline is to further build upon, improve and deepen nurses' knowledge and skills towards meeting the needs of families.\n【24】 This best practice guideline is intended for nurses working in all health care sectors. The overall goal of the guideline is to assist nurses in promoting family health through interventions and supports provided during expected as well as unexpected life events. Expected life events may include birth, school, adolescence, aging, and death, while unexpected life events may include trauma/accidents, chronic illness, developmental delay and disability. The guideline  includes recommendations for connecting nurses with families, in order to be able to assist families during these events. Lastly, this guideline includes recommendations for nurses and other health care providers to advocate for changes in the health care system.\n【25】 # The nursing best practice guideline focuses its recommendations on:\n【26】 Practice Recommendations directed at the nurse and nursing practice.\n【27】 Education Recommendations directed at the competencies required for practice.\n【28】 # Organization & Policy\n【29】 directed at the practice settings and the environment Recommendations to facilitate nurses' practice. This guideline contains recommendations for Registered Nurses (RNs) and Registered Practical Nurses (RPNs). It is acknowledged that effective patient/client care depends on a coordinated interdisciplinary approach incorporating ongoing communication between health professionals and patients/clients, ever mindful of the personal preferences and unique needs of each individual patient/client. Evidence to support the values was identified and specific actions pertaining to nursing was gathered; and Identified themes from the literature that led to the development of recommendations in three key areas.\n【30】 # Guideline Development Process\n【31】 An initial draft of the RNAO \"Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events\" nursing best practice guideline was reviewed by representative stakeholders and their feedback was incorporated. The stakeholders reviewing this guideline included clients, their families, staff nurses, various formal groups and organizations, and are acknowledged at the front of this document. This guideline was further refined after an eightmonth pilot implementation phase in selected practice settings in Ontario. Practice settings for RNAO nursing best practice guidelines are identified through a \"request for proposal\" process. The guideline was further refined taking into consideration the pilot site feedback and evaluation results.\n【32】 # Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events\n【33】 Family: Being unique and whomever the person defines as being family. Family members can include, but are not limited to parents, children, siblings, neighbours, and significant people in the community.\n【34】 Formal Groups or Organizations: Support and resources provided by a professional organization (Skemp Kelley, Pringle Specht & Maas, . Formal groups or organizations can include nurses, home support workers, long-term care facilities, respite or support groups.\n【35】 Informal Support: Support and resources provided by persons associated with the person receiving care. Persons providing informal support can include, but are not limited to family, friends, members of a church or synagogue, neighbours.\n【36】 Interdisciplinary Care: A process where health care professionals representing expertise from various health care disciplines participate in supporting clients and their families in the care process.\n【37】 Interfamilial Resources: Those resources that exist or occur among or involving several families.\n【38】 # Intrafamilial Resources:\n【39】 Those resources that exist or occur within the family.\n【40】 Long-term Care Facility: Residential setting for the provision of long-term care services including medical, nursing, rehabilitative, attendant, activity and social support services along with nutrition and shelter (Health Services Restructuring Commission, .\n【41】 Use of statistical methods to summarize the results of independent studies, can provide more precise estimates of the effects of health care than those derived from the individual studies included in a review (Clarke & Oxman, .\n【42】 Organization & Policy Recommendations: Statements of conditions required for a practice setting, that enable the successful implementation of the best practice guideline.\n【43】 The conditions for success are largely the responsibility of the organization, although they may have implications for policy at a broader government or societal level.\n【44】 Practice Recommendations: Statements of best practice directed at the practice of health care professionals that are ideally evidence-based.\n【45】 Respite: Planned, temporary relief for the primary caregiver through the provision of substitute care (Gottlieb & Johnson, .\n【46】 Stakeholder: An individual, group, or organization with a vested interest in the decisions and actions of organizations who may attempt to influence decisions and actions .\n【47】 Stakeholders include all individuals or groups who will be directly or indirectly affected by the change or solution to the problem. Stakeholders can be of various types, and can be divided into opponents, supporters, and neutrals (Ontario Public Health Association, .\n【48】 Systematic Review: Application of a rigourous scientific approach to the preparation of a review article (National Health and Medical Research Centre, . Systematic reviews establish where the effects of health care are consistent and research results can be applied across populations, settings, and differences in treatment (e.g. dose); and where effects may vary significantly. The use of explicit, systematic methods in reviews limits bias (systematic errors) and reduces chance effects, thus providing more reliable results upon which to draw conclusions and make decisions (Clarke & Oxman, .\n【49】 Unexpected Life Events: Life events that are not expected to happen. These can include, but are not limited to chronic illness, hospitalization, physical and/or mental trauma, move to a long-term care facility.\n【50】 # Background Context\n【51】 The family plays an integral role in promoting and maintaining health of family members, as well as providing physical and emotional support. This nursing best practice guideline was developed to increase nurses' awareness to the role and needs of the family and to facilitate the development of partnerships with the family and health care team.\n【52】 Since the early days of the nursing profession, nurses have consistently identified the importance of family in relation to health. Focusing on the family is an integral component of nursing practice, as health and illness behaviours are learned within the context of the family. Families are affected when one or more members experience related health issues. The family is a significant factor in the health and well-being of individuals, and promotion, maintenance and restoration of families are important to society's survival (Harmon Hanson & Thalman Boyd, .\n【53】 The concept of family is value-laden, and has varied over time in response to changes in predominant ideologies, values and social trends (Fast & Keating, 2000;Wass, . Family definitions tend to be described according to structural criteria (what they look like) or functional criteria (what they do) (Fast & Keating, . An example of a structural definition is:\n【54】 A now-married couple (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both spouses), a couple living common-law (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both partners), or a lone parent of any marital status, with at least one never-married son or daughter in the same dwelling (Statistics Canada, .\n【55】 A functional definition of the family by the Vanier Institute of the Family is as follows:\n【56】 Family is defined as any combination of two or more persons who are bound together over time by ties of mutual consent, birth, and/or adoption/placement and who together, assume responsibilities for variable combinations (for such things as) physical maintenance and care of group members (Vanier Institute of the Family, .\n【57】 Over the past three decades there have been significant changes in the family environment, such as smaller families, increased diversity and more complex family relationships researcher or policy-maker defines it (Fast & Keating, . Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline, the family is defined as:\n【58】 Being unique and whomever the individual identifies as being family.\n【59】 Families have strengths and require support as they undergo expected and unexpected life events. Throughout the life cycle, expected changes are experienced by all families (Rankin, .\n【60】 Developmental changes in a family such as transition to parenthood, being middle-aged parents, retirement and death, come in stages during which a period of disequilibrium occurs and adjustments are made (Kelly Martell, . An important nursing role is to assist families and their individual members move toward completion of individual and family developmental tasks throughout the lifespan (Friedman, 1992;Miller, Hornbrook, Archbold & Stewart, .\n【61】 When unexpected life events occur and a family member is at home or hospitalized with health care needs, the family experiences numerous complex demands. Recent trends within the health care system have resulted in an increased need for awareness of the significance of the family when providing caregiving. Restructuring of health care systems and the resulting budget cuts to health care organizations have resulted in the expectation for families to assist in caregiving when a family member is hospitalized (Marshall, . The increasing proportion of older people with disabilities and chronic illness, and technological advancements that enable medical treatments to be performed at home that were once only done in the hospital, have  dramatically changed the nature of home care. These trends have resulted in an increased reliance on family and friends to meet the needs of the frail, ill or disabled (Fast & Keating, .\n【62】 Women form the majority of home care personnel, such as visiting nurses, therapists and personal support workers (Martin Matthews, . Females  provide the majority of the caregiving of older family members (Aronson, 1991;Canadian Study of Health and Aging,  with wives and daughters predominating. This persistent differential representation of women providing both paid and unpaid care in the home means that shifts in the delivery of health care from institution to the household tend to affect women to a greater degree than men (Gregor, 1999;McKeever, .\n【63】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e 20\n【64】 # Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events\n【65】 # Interpretation of Evidence:\n【66】 Evidence-based practice has been defined as \"the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of patients\" (Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes & Richardson, 1996, p.. In order to ensure that current best evidence is used in the development of clinical guidelines, the methods of identification and interpretation of relevant evidence need to be critically appraised (Cluzeau, Littlejohns, Grimshaw, Feder & Moran, .\n【67】 Generally, \"the gold standard\" is given to evidence derived from the randomized controlled trial (RCT), either in isolation or preferably in a systematic review or meta-analysis (Sweeney, . In considering evidence, however, Berg  cautions nurses to not deny the less quantifiable aspects of nursing work.\n【68】 In developing this guideline, the development panel drew their evidence from a variety of sources (as discussed in the Background Context). The evidence was based on not only RCTs, but  on a number of qualitative sources, including studies that provided in-depth descriptions of family and nurse perceptions of their interactions with one another, and information about the relevance and helpfulness of nursing interventions involving families in care. Expert consensus was  utilized in this guideline when no other more scientifically formalized knowledge was available. In this way, patterns of knowing, including empirics, ethics, personal knowing and aesthetics, were captured (Carper, .\n【69】 # Vision, Values and Principles\n【70】 The development panel was guided by the \"5 R's\" to promote health in expected and unexpected life events:\n【71】 A high regard for the uniqueness of families.\n【72】 The continuous acknowledgement of the value of the role of families and of nurses.\n【73】 Awareness of the need to gain access to sources of support to relieve difficulty and/or recover strengths.\n【74】 The accountability on the part of families and nurses.\n【75】 The need to monitor outcomes and evaluate nursing practices.\n【76】 The panel then developed the following vision for supporting and strengthening families, believing that \"in a perfect world \" : Families would be supported across the care continuum in a caring, consistent, timely and effective manner.\n【77】 Families' needs and strengths would be recognized and the need for supports would be anticipated.\n【78】 # Families would have access to timely and comprehensive information.\n【79】 Families would be able to choose from a full range of respite care and support services which would be delivered consistently across Ontario in a flexible, culturally-sensitive, and affordable manner.\n【80】 Families would be comprehensively supported by nurses and other care providers because resources would be available to allow this to take place.\n【81】 Families would say their needs were met and they were supported and strengthened through the care experience.\n【82】 And lastly, the panel developed the following Values & Principles for supporting and strengthening families:\n【83】 We believe that it is important for nurses to recognize their own assumptions and values about families and cultural beliefs, and adjust their care accordingly.\n【84】 We believe that families and family relationships are unique and diverse, and that they may change over time.\n【85】 We believe families should be given sufficient information to make informed decisions.\n【86】 We believe that families have expert knowledge and skills that help them determine their own needs and respond to expected and unexpected life events.\n【87】 We believe that partnerships with families are built upon mutual trust, honesty, and collaboration. We suggest, however, that families should participate in care only to the extent that they want to or as much as they are able.\n【88】 We believe that the use of partnerships as a primary means of supporting and strengthening families increases the likelihood that nurses will follow a family-centred approach to care.\n【89】 We believe families should be supported in their choices.\n【90】 We understand that family members and the client may have different and conflicting needs.\n【91】 We believe that nurses should support family situations in accordance with the College of Nurses of Ontario's Ethical Framework for Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses (College of Nurses of Ontario, .\n【92】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e Practice Recommendations\n【93】 # A. The Nurse-Family Partnership\n【94】 Building a nurse-family partnership is central to strengthening and supporting families .\n【95】 To develop genuine partnerships there must be respect, trust, positive and open communication, listening, and mutual informing between the nurse and the family  p..\n【96】 # Recommendation 1\n【97】 Develop a genuine partnership with families by:\n【98】 Recognizing the family's assessment of the situation as essential;\n【99】 Acknowledging and respecting the important role of family in health care situations;\n【100】 Determining the desired degree of family involvement; and Negotiating the roles of both nurse and family within the partnership.\n【101】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【102】 Although the literature strongly supports the importance of recognizing the experiential, specific knowledge of the family, and their desire to act as full partners in the care of their family member, little attention has been given to the relationships between formal (professional) and informal (family) caregivers. As a result, families and nurses need to discuss their mutual concerns about the adequacy of resources to provide care. Friedman  and Hertzberg & Ekman  agree that when families pass on their responsibilities for the physical care of a family member to others, this does not necessarily relieve their sense of burden, and one way of reducing this discomfort is to involve the family more in the care of a loved one.\n【103】 Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events Friedman  and McDonald  confirm that families are a resource as well as a recipient of nursing service, as they bring knowledge, skills and experience to the relationship.\n【104】 Nurses should encourage families to share their experience (McCubbin & McCubbin, . It is essential to incorporate cultural beliefs and concerns shared by family members into the plan of care (Davidhizar & Giger, , and recognize the infinite variety and lack of stereotype in families from various ethnic groups (Wright & Leahey, . In addition, it is important to understand that the differences in family beliefs and values in families will affect the nurse-family partnership. Hupcey  cautions that families should always have the right to choose their level of participation in the relationship, and the family should be recognized as an active partner in providing care if they choose . Skemp Kelley  cite the need to assist the family to find meaningful and satisfactory caregiving roles.\n【105】 # B. Assessing Need\n【106】 Family assessments are critical in identifying how the family has been affected by the expected or unexpected life event. A family assessment is an exploration between the nurse and family to gain insight into the family's perspective of the event, their strengths and need for support (Neabel, Fothergill-Bourbonnais, & Dunning, . This perspective provides an understanding of how the quality of health of the family is intertwined with the health of its members (Lapp, Diemert, & Enestvedt, . Through a complete assessment, the nurse plays a pivotal role in assisting families adjust to the expected or unexpected life event. Based on the findings in the literature, as well as expert opinion, the guideline development panel offers the following recommendation:\n【107】 # Recommendation 2\n【108】 Assess individuals in the context of the family (as they define it) to identify whether assistance is required by the nurse to strengthen and support the family. While a family assessment should include information in the following areas, it should be tailored to address the uniqueness of each family through examining: Family structure; Environmental data; Family strengths; and Family supports.\n【109】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e\n【110】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【111】 The literature confirms that the assessment process is a critical component in exploring the overall health of the individual and family. Key components of an assessment and intervention framework of family nursing include listening to the family, engaging in a participatory dialogue between the nurse and family members, recognizing patterns and collaboratively identifying action and positive change . This data is gathered over time through direct questioning of family members, observations, and use of the nurse's knowledge and expertise.\n【112】 When assessing a family, it is important to remember that each family is unique and that the assessment process is a continually evolving process of data collection as family needs change.\n【113】 The family's characteristics, prior experiences, developmental level and personal resources will all interact with the environment to influence the manner in which families contend with expected and unexpected life events (Stover, Vaughan-Cole, O'Neill Conger, Abegglen, & McCoy, .\n【114】 Many approaches, techniques and models can be used to assess families. Some examples of family assessment models and approaches  Appendix A) are the Friedman Family Assessment Model .\n【115】 Family structure includes gathering information on the family's composition, culture/ethnicity, spiritual identification, economic status, lifestyle, health behaviours, developmental stage, power and role structure within the family, how the family communicates and who should be contacted. The environmental data explores the type and characteristics of the home as well as the community's characteristics such as access to health care, recreation, school, and environmental hazards. Family strengths identify the family's health beliefs and values. Other strengths that should be assessed are the family's fundamental values, coping mechanisms, problem solving strategies, resources and capabilities. Family supports are another area that should be assessed. Family supports examine the types of supports the family requires during the expected or unexpected life event. Issues that should be assessed include the family's appraisal of the stressor, their concerns, vulnerability, information needs and the degree of involvement the family wants in caregiving and decision making processes. (Appendix B includes questions that can be explored in each of these areas). Wright & Leahey  identify that the most common reason offered by nurses for not routinely assessing and involving families in their practice is because \"they don't have time\".\n【116】 They propose that a 15-minute family interview can be purposeful, effective, informative, and even therapeutic for family members. Key components of a 15-minute family interview include therapeutic discussions and questions, identifying who makes up the family unit, and identifying family and individual strengths.\n【117】 To gather data about the family, Wright & Leahey  suggest that the nurse needs to actively seek out opportunities to engage in purposeful discussions with family members.\n【118】 This can be achieved through inviting family to accompany the patient to the unit, clinic or hospital. Family can be routinely included in the admission procedure. During the patient orientation, family can routinely be invited to ask questions and participate.\n【119】 To learn more about the family unit and structure, nurses can ask questions in relation to the ages and current health of the household family members. Once this information has been collected, the nurse can assess external family structure information by asking such questions as \"who outside of your immediate family is an important resource or stress for you?\" (Wright & Leahey, . To assess how the client and family have managed health problems in the past, nurses can ask the family to describe routines at home. Lastly, nurses should consult families and clients about their ideas and concerns in relation to treatments and discharge (Wright & Leahey, .\n【120】 In the 15-minute interview, Wright and Leahey  identify questions that address important themes such as sharing of information, expectations and challenges of the life event, and the most pressing concerns/problems that need to be assessed. Laforet-Fliesser & Ford-Gilboe   identify five broad questions that can be explored with families to assist nurses in identifying how best to support families. (Examples of these questions can be found in Appendix B).\n【121】 N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e C. Providing Information, Accessing Resources and Supporting Family Resources\n【122】 The guideline development panel believes that families play a crucial role in the quality of care. If support and guidance are provided, enhanced quality of life is achieved both for the patient and their families. As a trusted professional, the nurse is in a unique position to guide the family to access the supports they require throughout the continuum of care.\n【123】 # Recommendation 3\n【124】 Identify resources and supports to assist families address the life event, whether this is expected or unexpected. Resources should be identified within the following three categories: Intrafamilial; Interfamilial; and Extrafamilial.\n【125】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【126】 The literature noted that families who access resources will gain a sense of control (which helps relieve stress and caregiver burden), and will reduce mental health problems (e.g. depression) often associated with family caregivers (Bourgeois, Schulz & Burgio, 1996;Gottlieb & Johnson, 2000;Ostwald, Hepburn, Caron, Burns & Mantell,. By recognizing and identifying these resources which can be classified as intrafamilial, interfamilial and extrafamilial, nurses can guide families to gain access to these means, recognizing that they may require a multifocal approach encompassing all three areas .\n【127】 Intrafamilial: Nurses can support families in recognizing their strengths and building upon them; in times of stress each family copes in their unique way. During assessment, individual coping mechanisms should be identified: Spirituality e.g. prayer, formalized religion ; Individual counseling ;\n【128】 Cultural strengths (Fast & Keating, ; and\n【129】 Implementing self-care strategies e.g. personal journal, accepting help, acknowledging need for rest and revitalization .\n【130】 Interfamilial: It is important to assist patients and their families to access the services of support groups ;\n【131】 Organized educational programs for families related to specific skills training .\n【132】 Extrafamilial: Nurses can act as advocates, coordinating and facilitating access to care, and can provide information on: Community resources and programs e.g. home care and respite care\n【133】 Guides to local community resources e.g. Community Service book; and Educational and skill training programs (Hawkins, 1996, Magliano et al., 1998a.\n【134】 # D. Educating Nurses, Family, Policy-Makers and the Public\n【135】 Ongoing education for all parties involved (nurses, family, policy-makers and public) is key in supporting families. For nurses, this education is an essential component of understanding their role in facilitating family coping. Education would assist nurses to acknowledge the family's unique role in the client/patient's life, helps acknowledge the nurse's bias (e.g. cultural, spiritual) and helps assess the family's ability to cope using recognized assessment tools.\n【136】 Education is a life-long expectation for nursing practice. ( Education Recommendations for a discussion of the competencies required for nursing practice in family-centred care).\n【137】 Education for families and clients supports coping by providing disease-specific information, information relating to coping and skill development, and information on how to maneuver the health care system. Providing information and education is an important step in involving families in the care of their family members, as they are not always involved in the care to the extent they want to be (Laitinen,.\n【138】 Lastly, education for policy-makers and the public is essential in family coping with expected and unexpected life events; nurses must educate policy-makers and the public on issues, which impact on care  Organization & Policy Recommendations).\n【139】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e\n【140】 # Recommendation 4\n【141】 Educate and provide information to nurses, families, policy-makers and the public to assist families to manage expected or unexpected life events.\n【142】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【143】 The literature indicates that some practice settings are not supportive of the notion that families and nurses require education to heighten awareness of the need for family involvement . As relationships among health care providers and families have changed over time, nurses need to be prepared to adapt care to families' needs and their preferred style of interaction. Dixon  agrees that education will facilitate this adaptation.\n【144】 Education around the role of families in care giving is another important area of support. As Health Care Reforms continue to be implemented, the impact on the family is great. Some families want more control and involvement in the care of their family member, while others feel that institutions have to take more responsibility in care issues. Skemp Kelley  discuss a negotiated partnership in health care issues. Support programs involving educational components have been researched and indications are that supports need to be made available at an early stage to families .\n【145】 Changing visiting policy in institutions, which limit access, will positively impact families coping with life events (Giganti, . Further research to guide decision-making about policies and funding issues to support caregivers is essential (Fast & Keating, .\n【146】 # Education Recommendations\n【147】 A focus on family-centred care should be incorporated into all levels of nursing curricula.\n【148】 Close examination of the definition of family-centred care by Dunst, Trivette & Deal  reveals a number of beliefs that emphasize a participatory, highly responsive approach to working with families. Major emphasis should be placed on:\n【149】 Creating opportunities for families to become more competent and independent;\n【150】 Strengthening families by building on their strengths and natural resources rather than supplanting their social support networks with professional \"expert\" service; and\n【151】 Enhancing the family's acquisition of a wide variety of competencies and resources.\n【152】 Focusing on the family (not the patient), on family capacities (not deficits), and on promotion of growth-producing behaviour (not treatment of problems) contrasts with a more traditional approach to nursing. Reconceptualizing the relationship between the nurse and family as one of sharing responsibility and mutual problem solving requires a shift in how professionals interact with families. Professional educational programs could, in part, assist with this shift and expansion in the roles nurses play in working with families.\n【153】 An orientation to family-centred care should include family assessment (family structure, environmental data, identification of family strengths, supports and needs, family developmental stage and family history) and the vision, values, and principles of supporting and strengthening families. In addition, it is important to ensure nursing staff have the awareness and ability to effectively access resources (intrafamilial, interfamilial, and extrafamilial) and current information and research on family-centred care.\n【154】 By providing opportunities for professional development, organizations are enabling nurses to: Enhance knowledge and skills around family-centred care (i.e. effective communication and conflict management skills, negotiation, advocacy, etc.).\n【155】 Access a variety of professional development activities (i.e. internal workshops and inservices or external courses and workshops), through reimbursement or payment for professional development activities and flexible scheduling etc.\n【156】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e\n【157】 # Recommendation 5\n【158】 Sustain a caring workplace environment conducive to family-centred practice by:\n【159】 Ensuring that nursing staff are oriented to family-centred care, including family assessment;\n【160】 Ensuring that nurses have the awareness and ability to effectively access resources; and Providing ongoing opportunities for professional development for nursing staff, including knowledge and skills regarding family-centred care.\n【161】 # Organization & Policy Recommendations\n【162】 # Promoting a Caring Environment\n【163】 Many of the recommendations in this guideline are predicated by caring and supportive workplace/environment policies. If practice settings are not conducive to supporting and strengthening families, it will be difficult for the nurses to enact the range of best practice activities being recommended in this document. The guideline development panel feels strongly that practice settings have a responsibility to the person receiving care, their family, and to their employees. This involves creating, promoting and sustaining practice settings that are caring environments, centred on a philosophy of supporting and strengthening families. Employers in all sectors need to develop employee assistance programs promoting family health.\n【164】 # Recommendation 6\n【165】 Support the implementation of family-centred practice in the workplace by: Ensuring appropriate staffing levels, assignments, and staffing categories; Implementing family-centred practices and policies;\n【166】 Creating and maintaining physical work environments that are conducive to promoting family involvement; and Developing employee assistance programs promoting family health.\n【167】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【168】 The literature supports the concept of ensuring appropriate staffing levels (e.g. permanent full-time and part-time positions), staff mix, care delivery models and resources that promote continuity and consistency of caregiver to allow nurses to support families (Kirk, 1998; model that facilitates consistency and continuity of care would provide sufficient time for meaningful opportunities for interactions of nurses with patient/clients and family members that support and strengthen the family through the care experience.\n【169】 Family-centred practices and policies (e.g. open visitation policies including hours, number of family members and flexibility regarding who is considered family) foster and maintain patient and family involvement in planning, decision-making and provision of care, as a core activity of the organization . Family-centred values are integrated into the mission, vision and values of practice settings, and nursing staff, through orientation, experience and assimilation, incorporate these values in their practice.\n【170】 Family-centred care is  supported by creating and maintaining physical work environments (e.g. a home-like atmosphere at the bedside and in waiting rooms), that can accommodate family members (Giganti,1998;Hertzberg & Ekman, .\n【171】 Employee assistance programs (e.g. flexible scheduling, time off, support groups and on-site day care) are additional supports to family-centred practice (Hawkins, .\n【172】 Many of the recommendations offered in this guideline are dependent on the availability of adequate funding for health care in Ontario, as well as the appropriate allocation of funding by health care organizations. If adequate public funding is not available, nurses will have neither the time nor the capacity to carry out the range of best practice activities recommended in this guideline. To ensure adequate support for family-centred practice, nurses must advocate for changes to public policy. Advocacy, or the act of promoting for a particular policy or position, is a well-recognized strategy for change. While advocacy has historically been thought of as a political approach, and out of the normal range of activities for health professionals, it is increasingly recognized by professional associations, health provider organizations and policymakers that health professionals in particular (and all citizens generally) must advocate for changes that they feel are needed in Ontario's health care arena.\n【173】 Over the past few decades Health Care Reforms across Canada have shifted the burden of responsibility for caregiving from hospitals and institutions, where formal caregivers provide care, to home and communities, where families are expected to provide care (Fast & Keating, 31 N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e . These changes, the result of a significant shift in policy directions, have had a profound impact on clients of all ages, and their families. Nurses, as caregivers to clients and families, are  deeply affected by these changes. Heavy workloads, stressful work environments and limited resources inevitably affect the lives of nurses and their patients.\n【174】 The guideline development panel strongly supports the recommendation that nurses must take an active role in advocating for health policy and health care funding changes that ensure adequate resources and appropriate staffing levels for nurses in all parts of Ontario's health care continuum. Nurses must take every opportunity to present their views on health care policy to administrators, policy-makers, politicians, provider associations and union leaders.  Lewis  proposes that nurses advocate for:\n【175】 # Discussion of Evidence\n【176】 A public discussion on family caregiving;\n【177】 The development of a public position on what level of caregiving is reasonable to expect from family caregivers; and\n【178】 # Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events\n【179】 Confirmation of when the public might expect the health care system to step in to provide care.\n【180】 The literature  supports the role of the nurses as an advocate for: Public education about the value and legitimacy of the role of family caregivers (CareWatch Phoneline, 1999;Laitinen, ;\n【181】 A full range of adequate and effective respite care programs which facilitate family caregiving ; Consistency in the funding, availability, and delivery of respite care programs in communities across Ontario .\n【182】 # Recommendation 8\n【183】 Nursing best practice guidelines can only be successfully implemented if there are adequate planning, resources, organizational and administrative support, as well as appropriate facilitation. Organizations may wish to develop a plan for implementation that includes:\n【184】 An assessment of organizational readiness and barriers to education; Involvement of all members (whether in a direct or indirect supportive function) who will contribute to the implementation process; Dedication of a qualified individual to provide the support needed for the education and implementation process;\n【185】 Ongoing opportunities for discussion and education to reinforce the importance of best practices; and Opportunities for reflection on personal and organizational experience in implementing guidelines.\n【186】 In this regard, RNAO (through a panel of nurses, researchers and administrators) has developed the \"Toolk\n【187】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e Evaluation & Monitoring\n【188】 Organizations implementing the recommendations in this nursing best practice guideline are recommended to consider how the implementation and its impact will be monitored and evaluated.\n【189】 The following table, based on a framework outlined in the RNAO Toolk\n【190】 # Supporting and Strengthening Families Through Expected and Unexpected Life Events\n【191】 - To evaluate changes in practice that lead towards a nurse-family partnership.\n【192】 - Modification to policies and procedures consistent with the values of family-centred care.\n【193】 - Nurses' self-assessed knowledge of the importance of:\n【194】 - Family-centred care.\n【195】 - The nurse-family partnership.\n【196】 - Documenting the family's understanding of a situation, rather than the nurse's judgement of the client.\n【197】 - Per cent of nurses self-reporting:\n【198】 - Adequate assessment of a family's desire to be an active partner in the care of a family member. - Development and adequate documentation of the familycentred care plan. - Sharing family's concern with other members of the health care team.\n【199】 - Costs for education and other interventions.\n【200】 - To evaluate the impact of implementation of the recommendations.\n【201】 - Enhanced practice of familycentred care.\n【202】 - Staff satisfaction.\n【203】 - Nursing and non-nursing staff report active involvement in implementation process.\n【204】 - Per cent of clients/families with family assessment recorded on chart\n【205】 - Improved client-family satisfaction.\n【206】 - Families report being included as full partners in the care plan, feel they are being listened to.\n【207】 - Overall resource utilization.\n【208】 - To evaluate the supports available in the organization that allow for nurses to practice family-centred care with their clients.\n【209】 - Review of guideline recommendations by organizational committee(s) responsible for policies/ procedures.\n【210】 - Organizational mission that supports family-centred care and the nurse-family partnership.\n【211】 - Commitment to ensure continuity of family-centred care.\n【212】 - Per cent of nurses attending education sessions (orientation, professional development opportunities) on family-centred care.\n【213】 - Per cent of non-nursing staff attending education sessions (orientation, professional development activities) on family-centred care.\n【214】 - Adequate financial resources for staffing to provide familycentred care\n【215】 - Nursing turnover costs.\n【216】 # Process For Update/Review of Guideline\n【217】 The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario proposes to update the nursing best practice guideline as follows:\n【218】 - Following dissemination, each nursing best practice guideline will be reviewed by a team of specialists (Review Team) in the topic area, every three years following the last set of revisions.\n【219】 # During the three-year period between development and revision, RNAO Nursing Best\n【220】 Practice Guidelines project staff will regularly monitor for new systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the topic area.\n【221】 - Based on the results of the monitor, project staff may recommend an earlier revision period.\n【222】 Appropriate consultation with a team of members comprising of original panel members and other specialists in the field will help inform the decision to review and revise the guideline earlier than the three-year milestone. The revised guideline will undergo dissemination based on established structures and processes.\n【223】 # N u r s i n g B e s t P r a c t i c e G u i d e l i n e\n【224】 Examples of General Questions to guide the family assessment and interview:\n【225】 - Who of your family and friends would you like us to share information with and who not?\n【226】 (Identifies alliances, resources and conflictual relationships)\n【227】 - How can we be most helpful to you and your family or friends during the hospitalization?\n【228】 (Clarifies expectations, increased collaboration)\n【229】 - What has been most/least helpful to you in past hospitalizations or health visits?\n【230】 (Identifies past strengths, problems to avoid and successes to repeat) 4.

How could I improve?\n【237】 (Demonstrates a willingness to learn from families and work collaboratively)\n【238】 (Adapted from Wright & Leahey, . Laforet-Fliesser & Ford-Gilboe  identify five broad questions that can be explored with families to assist nurses in implementing a family assessment:\n【239】 - What is the family working on or dealing with?\n【240】 - How is the family going about it? The \"Toolkit\" provides step-by-step directions to individuals and groups involved in planning, coordinating and facilitating the guideline implementation. Specifically, the \"Toolkit\" addresses the following key steps:\n【241】 - Identifying a well-developed, evidence-based clinical practice guideline.\n【242】 - Identification, assessment and engagement of stakeholders.\n【243】 - Assessment of environmental readiness for guideline implementation.\n【244】 - Identifying and planning evidence-based implementation strategies.\n【245】 - Planning and implementing evaluation.\n【246】 - Identifying and securing required resources for implementation.\n【247】 Implementing guidelines in practice that result in successful practice changes and positive clinical impact is a complex undertaking. The \"Toolkit\" is one key resource for managing this process.\n【248】 The \"Toolkit\" is available through the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario. The document is available in a bound format for a nominal fee, and is  available free of charge off the RNAO website. For more information, an order form or to download the \"Toolkit\", please visit the RNAO website at . term \"family as partner\" has tended to focus on family members who provide care to other members -whether they act or feel as partners in care is debatable. The concept of \"family-centred nursing\" needs to be examined further in order to move beyond the family caregiver model and to embrace an empowering partnership with the family. The aim of this approach to family nursing practice is to promote the health of the family.\n【249】 # Revision Panel Members\n【250】 The following definition is added to those in the \"Definition of Terms\" section starting on page 15 of the guideline.\n【251】 # Empowering Partnership:\n【252】 An empowering partnership between a nurse and a family is a collaborative relationship built on mutual respect and trust, as well as the sharing of knowledge, skills and experience. Ultimately, families and nurses are empowered to grow and learn together as partners in the promotion of the health of the family.\n【253】 # Revision Process\n【254】 # Summary of Evidence\n【255】 The following content reflects the evidence reviewed that either supports the original recommendations, or provides evidence for revisions. Through the review process, no recommendations were added or deleted, however a number of recommendations were reworded to reflect new knowledge.\n【256】 # Recommendation 1\n【257】 Develop an empowering partnership with families by:\n【258】 Recognizing the family's assessment of the situation as essential;\n【259】 Acknowledging and respecting the important role of family in health care situations;\n【260】 Determining the desired degree of family involvement; and  Negotiating the roles of both nurse and family within the partnership.\n【261】 The wording of this recommendation has been revised to reflect the concept of \"an empowering partnership\" which incorporates the previous concept of \"genuine partnership\" -really knowing about the family and supporting the \"here and now\" of the person. The Developmental Model of Health and Nursing (DMHN) supports the concept of empowering partnerships, as the model emphasizes health as a process and the capacities all families have, including their potential for growth and change. Health is seen as a social process that is shaped by the social context of family life, including social and political realities that may restrict individual and family choices for health. The nurse is viewed as a partner in the family process of developing health (Ford-Gilboe, . An empowering partnership is seen as a collaborative relationship built on mutual respect and trust, as well as the sharing of knowledge, skills and experience.\n【262】 Central to an empowering partnership is the negotiation of roles and an appreciation of the types of knowledge and authority that both nurses and families bring to the relationship. Being able to understand the difference between \"power with\" and \"power over\" approaches in a relationship will assist nurses to develop more empowering negotiating strategies within families. Exploring the intrinsic factors that shape different types of family relationships, reviewing empowering negotiating strategies and reflecting on specific experiences with families will help nurses develop positive relationships that are flexible enough to promote a genuine sharing of both authority and expertise .

While a family assessment should include information in the following areas, it should be tailored to address the uniqueness of each family through examining:\n【264】 Family perceptions of the event(s);\n【265】 Family structure;\n【266】 Environmental conditions; and  Family strengths.\n【267】 The wording of the recommendation has been revised to more closely align with the concepts of assessing family in the context of their perceptions of the event and family as the unit of care (family as client).\n【268】 Ward-Griffin  conducted a descriptive study exploring the perspectives of individuals caring for a family member with mental illness, with particular attention to the family perspectives of the experience in relation to housing, quality of supports, and formal care services and to identify potential solutions to difficulties encountered by families. The researchers found that these families were part of a \"circle of care\", offering support to their members with mental illness in order to promote their independence, but at the same time trying to protect them from the realities of the system. Inadequate and inappropriate resources and supports pushed families into a cycle of caregiving that compromised their health and that of their family member.\n【269】 Revisions to the Appendix that supports this recommendation are included on page 7 of this supplement.\n【270】 # Additional Literature Supports\n【271】 Allen & Warner, 2002;Astedt-Kurki et al., 2002;Ballard-Reisch & Letner, 2003;Callahan, 2003;Ford-Gilboe, 2002;Gill, 2001;Holden et al., 2002;Hopia et al., 2005;Knafi & Deatrick, 2003;Kristjanson, 2004;Mok et al., 2002;Sharpe et al., 2005;Ward-Griffin et al., 2005\n【272】 # Recommendation 3\n【273】 Identify resources and supports to assist families to address the life event, whether this is expected or unexpected.\n【274】 Resources should be identified within the following three categories:\n【275】 Interfamilial; and  Extrafamilial. Sharpe  explored the available support and unmet needs of people with advanced cancer, their family caregivers and their health care professionals. Findings from this study indicate that individuals with advanced cancer tended to underestimate the level of support that they received or needed. Health care professionals identified greater levels of need than the individual and family caregivers reported, but still underestimated the support needs of the person and their family. Opportunities need to be made available for individuals and family caregivers to discuss the life event they are experiencing and the needs they perceive. Providing opportunities for families to identify their needs and access resources to address these needs will have a positive impact on family strengths.\n【276】 An ethnographic study conducted by Gill  found that nurses supported breastfeeding mothers by providing information and interpersonal support. Breastfeeding mothers identified their support needs as information, encouragement and interpersonal support. The conclusion of this study was that nurses have a positive impact on breastfeeding mothers (and families), but the resources and support offered must be the kind the mothers (families) want.\n【277】 Family members provide support to the ill family member, and have needs of support from health professionals. Family members whose own need for support is not met are less able to maintain their supportive role, and are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems (Kristjanson, . Resources and supports identified to support the + + family, in a review by Kristjanson , included information giving, practical assistance with physical care requirements, facilitating emotional support and family communication and assistance with financial burdens of care. These key areas of support need intersect with the categories of intrafamilial, interfamilial and extrafamilial resources.\n【278】 The revised Appendix on page 7 supports this recommendation in relation to assessing intra, inter and extrafamilial resources.\n【279】 # Additional Literature Supports\n【280】 Ford- Gilboe, 2002;Gill, 2001;Holden et al., 2002;Hong et al., 2003;Hopia et al., 2005;Knafi & Deatrick, 2003;Kristjanson, 2004;Kuuppelomäki, 2002;Petrie, Logan & DeGrasse, 2001;Scott 2003;Sharpe et al., 2005;Taainila, Syrjala, Kokkonen & Jarvelin, 2002;Thyen, Sperner, Morfield, Meyer & Ravens-Sieberer, 2003 + +\n【281】 # Recommendation 6\n【282】 Support the implementation of interdisciplinary family-centred practice in the workplace by:\n【283】 Ensuring appropriate resources (e.g., time, staffing);\n【284】 Developing and implementing family-centred practices and policies;\n【285】 Creating and maintaining environments that are conducive to family-centred care; and  Developing programs that promote work life balance for employees.\n【286】 The wording of this recommendation has been revised to reflect new knowledge regarding the implementation of family-centred practice.\n【287】 Family-centred practice requires resources of time and staffing. Kristjanson, 2004 describes the importance of having time allocated for communication exchange with individuals and families. Health care professional may limit their information sharing with patients and families because of the pace of their busy work schedules. When information is provided, it is often shared in the hallway, over the phone or in public spaces with limited privacy. By not allocating time and space for family discussions and sharing of information, workplaces convey a message that this exchange is not important.\n【288】 The findings of a feminist narrative study  suggest that female health professionals who assume familial caregiving responsibilities continually negotiate the boundaries between their professional and personal caring work. Although they use a variety of strategies to manage their caregiving demands, many women experienced a blurring of professional/personal boundaries, resulting in feelings of isolation, tension, and extreme physical and mental exhaustion. These findings suggest that women who are double-duty caregivers, especially those with limited time, finances, or other tangible supports, may experience negative impacts on their health. Having programs available for employees that promote work life balance demonstrates a commitment to interdisciplinary family-centred practice.\n【289】 Additional Literature Supports Bruce et al., 2002;Gill, 2001;Hong et al., 2003;Hopia et al., 2005;Knafl & Deatrick, 2003;Kristjanson, 2004;Legrow & Rossen, 2005;Mok et al., 2002;Ward-Griffin, C., Brown, J. B., Vandervoort, A., McNair, S., & Dashnay, I., 2006 Recommendation 7\n【290】 Advocate for changes in public policy by:\n【291】 Lobbying for public discussion on family caregiving and the development of a public position on what level of caregiving is reasonable to expect from families;\n【292】 Lobbying for public education about the value and legitimacy of the role of family caregivers and how multiple family members respond to life events;\n【293】 Lobbying for a full range of adequate and effective programs for family members who are involved in caregiving and other life events within the family;\n【294】 Lobbying for consistency in funding, availability and delivery of respite care programs and other supports for families across Ontario;\n【295】 Lobbying for the funding of research projects that examine family as the providers and recipients of care, and the application of lessons learned from this research into public policy and program development; and  Lobbying for mechanisms within organizations for families to dialogue with one another in an open forum.\n【296】 The wording of this recommendation has been revised to reflect the need for advocacy activities beyond a focus on family caregivers/caregiving.\n【297】 In their study of the perspectives of individuals caring for a family member with mental illness, Ward-Griffin  identified the need for nurses to build trusting and respectful collaborations with families and to take action through advocacy for policy and service changes in various sectors at the local, municipal and federal government.\n【298】 There are opportunities for nurses to strengthen and support families in informing policy, for example, through the mental health reform process. Lobbying for public policies that support the broader determinants of health, such as affordable housing, via provincial and national family support organizations are further advocacy opportunities.\n【299】 The application of lessons learned from research into public policy and program development is critical.

Empowering and optimizing existing human potential by providing new ways to respond to expected or unexpected life events can be effective at the personal and organizational level. Providing knowledge and structures that allow all involved in care to respond to the family's needs empowers the family and allows for transfer of authority. Organizations and systems with cultures that foster empowering care partnerships are able to de-centre the professional in relationships with clients and de-centre the organization in relation to all involved in care .\n【333】 # Additional Literature Supports\n【334】 Allen & Warner, 2002;Gill, 2001;Holden et al., 2002;Hong et al., 2003;Hopia et al., 2005;Kristjanson, 2004;McWilliam et al., 2003;Mok 2002;Petrie et al., 2001;Taainila et al., 2002;Thyen et al., 2003\n【335】 # Recommendation 5\n【336】 Sustain a caring workplace environment conducive to family-centred practice by:\n【337】 Ensuring that nursing staff are oriented to the values and assessment of family-centred care;\n【338】 Ensuring that nurses have the knowledge, skill and judgement to implement family-centred care; and  Providing ongoing opportunities for professional development for nursing staff.\n【339】 The wording of this recommendation has been revised to reflect an increased focus on skill development and application to family-centred practice.\n【340】 The skill of facilitation is to be included as an outcome in an orientation to family-centred care (Guideline -pg . Gill  and Ford-Gilboe  have identified that individuals and families expect encouragement and support from nurses in relation to responding to life events. Families engage in health work on their own as they learn from the life events that they encounter. However, nurses facilitate this learning when assistance has been sought to support the family efforts to manage a particular situation (Ford-Gilboe, .\n【341】 Skill development that supports the emergence of relationship-centred care is essential as interactions amongst people are the foundation of any therapeutic activity. These relationships exist at many levels, including those between patients, their families, staff from all disciplines and the wider community. These relationships are the medium for exchanging information, feelings and concerns needed for a better understanding of the life event .\n【342】 Additional Literature Supports Bruce et al., 2002;Ford-Gilboe, 2002;Gill, 2001;Holden et al., 2002;Hong et al., 2003;Hopia et al., 2005;Knafl & Deatrick, 2003, Kristjanson, 2004Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady & Nolan, 2004\n【343】 # Recommendation 8\n【344】 Nursing best practice guidelines can only be successfully implemented if there are adequate planning, resources, organizational and administrative support, as well as appropriate facilitation. Organizations may wish to develop a plan for implementation that includes:\n【345】 An assessment of organizational readiness and barriers to education;\n【346】 Involvement of all members (whether in a direct or indirect supportive function) who will contribute to the implementation process;\n【347】 Dedication of a qualified individual to provide the support needed for the education and implementation process;\n【348】 Ongoing opportunities for discussion and education to reinforce the importance of best practices; and\n【349】 Opportunities for reflection on personal and organizational experience in implementing guidelines.\n【350】 Additional Literature Supports\n【351】 # Implementation Strategies\n【352】 The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario and the guideline panel have compiled a list of implementation strategies to assist health care organizations or health care disciplines who are interested in implementing this guideline. A summary of these strategies follows:\n【353】 Provide organizational support such as having the structures in place to facilitate family-centred practices. For example, having an organizational philosophy and vision that reflects the value of best practices through policies and procedures. Develop new assessment and documentation tools (Davies & Edwards, .\n【354】 Identify and support designated best practice champions on each unit to promote and support implementation. Celebrate milestones and achievements, acknowledging work well done (Davies & Edwards, .\n【355】 Establish a process to facilitate the cultivation of positive family-nurse relationships. This process may include adequate time and resources, documentation of family care transactions, and family-centred care as a component of staff performance reviews. These approaches may help to sustain a family-centred approach to care and to achieve partnerships between families and nurses .\n【356】 Organizations implementing this guideline should adopt a range of self-learning, group learning, mentorship and reinforcement strategies that will over time, build the knowledge and confidence of nurses in providing family-centred care. Mentorship of nursing staff leaders may help to foster family-centred practices .\n【357】 # Research Gaps and Implications\n【358】 In order to assist nurses in the provision of family-centred care, additional research in the following areas would benefit practice:\n【359】 How to determine the desired degree of family involvement in care;\n【360】 Strategies for providing nurses with the skills required to negotiate roles within the partnership;\n【361】 Key components of a comprehensive assessment of the \"event\";  Children's needs for support when an adult member of their family is the focus of the \"event\";\n【362】 Effective strategies nurses use in transferring knowledge that has meaning for the family; and\n【363】 Requirements for specific types of support, public policy etc. related to certain life events.\n【364】 The review/revision process did not identify a need for any additional appendices; however significant revisions have been made to Appendix B, which has been replaced with the following revised content.\n【365】 # Appendix B (Revised):\n【366】 In conducting a family assessment, the nurse engages in a partnership with the family to assess their perception of, and their capacity to address, the life event.\n【367】 # Sample Questions for Key Areas of Family Assessment\n【368】 # FAMILY PERCEPTIONS OF THE EVENT(S)\n【369】 Family appraisal of the event: What is the family's perception of the event? Is it expected or unexpected? What is the family's estimate of the strength and duration of the event?\n【370】 Major concerns: What are the family's major concerns?\n【371】 # FAMILY STRUCTURE\n【372】 Identifying data: Names, ages, addresses. Who is the primary person to contact? Does the family have any transportation difficulties?\n【373】 Composition: Family Unit -Could you tell me who is in the family? Is there anyone else who is not related that you think of as family? How close is the family? Who lives with you? Are there any family pets? Is there anything else you would like to add?\n【374】 Culture/ethnicity: Knowledge and customs of family -Could you tell me about the family's cultural background? Does ethnicity influence the family's health beliefs? Are there any ethnic customs the family gains strength from or may need assistance with?\n【375】 Spiritual identification: Characteristic values of a person which may or may not be a religious affiliation -Are your spiritual beliefs a resource for family members? Is there anyone that can be contacted to assist the family with their spiritual needs?\n【376】 Sexual identification: The sexual orientation with which a family member identifies or is identified -Some people who are facing an experience similar to your family are concerned about their sexual abilities and their sexual partners. It may be helpful for us to discuss any questions or concerns you may have.  Coping mechanisms: Ability to adapt to the life event and maintain emotional well-being and stability of its members -How has the family responded to past life events? What helped the most and the least? What strengths does the family have to assist with their response? Do family members differ in their ways of responding?\n【377】 Problem solving: Family's ability to organize a life event into manageable components and to identify courses of action to solve it effectively. How has the family resolved problems in the past? What resources have they used?\n【378】 Family Resources and Supports: Resources the family uses to assist in adapting to the life event -What internal (inter, intra) and external (extra) resources or supports is your family using?\n【379】 Examples of General Questions to guide the family assessment and interview (Guideline -pg  remain unchanged.\n【380】 Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario .

Through studies and monitoring, it has been found to have a high affinity and it behaves as a competitive antagonist to the five muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Revefenacin is shown to dissociate slower from the receptor M3 compared to the receptor M2. That shows a kinetic selectivity for this subtype of receptors. It produces a suppressive action of the acetocholine evoked calcium mobilization and contractile responses in the airway tissue. Revefenacin is a long-lasting muscarinic antagonist, so it can only be administered one dose daily. The activity of Revefenacin produces a long-lasting protection against the bronchoconstrictor response acetylcholine and methacholine.\n【117】 ## Structure\n【118】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【119】 The reported volume of distribution is 218 L which suggests an extensive distribution to the tissues\n【120】 There are two phases of elimination: Kinetics Elimination: rapid declining plasma concentration followed by slow bi-exponential elimination. Renal Elimination: the amount excreted in urine is the unchanged drug, <0.2% of the administered dose.\n【121】 Following the IV administration, 54% of dose is recovered in feces and 27- in urine\n【122】 In clinical trials that tested Yupelri effect on pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures that would be 209 times the maximum exposure compared to the maximum human dose, it produced no birth defects or harm.\n【123】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【124】 There is limited information regarding Revefenacin Pharmacokinetics in the drug label.\n【125】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【126】 ### Impairment of Fertility\n【127】 - There are no studies performed on humans and the harm rate is unknown for pregnant women. However, studies performed on pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in slim to 0 fetal harm.\n【128】 # Clinical Studies\n【129】 ### Study in Adult Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n【130】 - The clinical trials are secured and conducted in many different conditions, so it cannot be compared to other drugs undergoing clinical trials\n【131】 - There were two 12-week trials and one 52-week trial\n【132】 - The patients received a total of 175 mcg of Yupelri one-time daily\n【133】 - 12-week trials: There were two 12-week trials. They are replicated trials that use placebo.\n【134】 These trials were conducted on patients with moderate to severe COPD. There were a total of 395 patients, ages ranging from 41-88. The demographics are 50% male, and 90% Caucasian out of the total patients. 13% of the Yupelri treated patients discontinued the trial due to adverse reactions, and 19% of the placebo patients.\n【135】 - These trials were conducted on patients with moderate to severe COPD.

Silent mutations may  affect splicing, or transcriptional control.\n【3】 In molecular cloning experiments, it can be useful to introduce silent mutations into a gene of interest in order to create or remove recognition sites for restriction enzymes.

Many health care regions in Canada have cancelled or limited surgical and non-surgical interventions on patients to preserve healthcare resources for a predicted increase in COVID19 related hospital admissions. Also reduced health interventions may limit the risk of possible transmission of COVID19 to other patients and health care workers during this pandemic. The majority of institutions in Canada have developed their own operational mandates regarding access to surgical resources for patients suffering from Head and Neck Cancers during this pandemic. There is a large degree of individual practitioner judgement in deciding access to care as well as resource allocation during these challenging times. The Canadian Association of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology (CAHNSO) convened a task force to develop a set of guidelines based on the best current available evidence to help Head and Neck Surgical Oncologists and all practitioners involved in the care of these patients to help guide individual practice decisions. Main body: The majority of head and neck surgical oncology from initial diagnosis and work up to surgical treatment and then follow-up involves aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) which inherently put head and neck surgeons and practitioners at high risk for transmission of COVID19. The aggressive nature of the majority of head and neck cancer negates the ability for deferring surgical treatment for a prolonged period of time. The included guidelines provide recommendations for resource allocation for patients, use of personal protective equipment for practitioners as well as recommendations for modification of practice during the current pandemic.# Introduction\n【1】 The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID as a novel virus causing severe respiratory illness was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan China. Since that time the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID19 a pandemic (Mar 112, and health authorities have been mobilizing to accommodate a predicted surge in patients who require hospital and/or intensive care unit admission due to the direct effects of the virus . The reality of oncologic surgery is that any significant delay in time to treatment will often have a deleterious effect on survival and functional outcomes for the individual patient. This makes managing head and neck cancer patients in the pandemic era much more challenging due to resource limitations placed on the healthcare system by COVID19. In the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, significant limitations were placed on surgical resource access in Ontario which did have a long term effect both on patient care as well as economic impact on the healthcare system once the pandemic passed and the backlog of surgical patients placed an increased strain on the system resources .\n【2】 Head and neck surgical oncology is particularly challenging in the COVID19 era as all aspects of patient care from initial consultation, to surgical treatment, then post-treatment follow-up involve some degree of AGMPs in standard practice. The upper aerodigestive tract includes the nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and trachea. This tract is a zone of intense COVID-19 viral replication . There is growing evidence that personnel who perform procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract, and in particular otolaryngologists Head and Neck Surgeons are at high risk of not only becoming exposed to COVID-19, but  developing severe illness from the virus . In an anecdotal report from Wuhan, it was noted that 14 personnel became may have been infected from a single endoscopic trans-sphenoidal pituitary case, including every  staff member that was involved in the case . Europe has seen the same high infection rate of otolaryngologists, as reported by intensive care units across the region . There was recently a report of four otolaryngologists in the UK having been infected, two of which are intubated and in critical condition in the ICU, after having contracted COVID-19 from asymptomatic patients . Reliable reports have documented active transmission in asymptomatic cases . The increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in these procedures is thought to be due to the high viral load in the upper respiratory tract . Not only this, but persons who are exposed to high viral loads, such as during surgery as opposed to contracting the virus in the community, are thought to suffer more severe illness due to the release of cytokine storms in these settings .\n【3】 This new and emerging information has led to several specialty societies and health authorities making recommendations on the use of PPE in procedures that are considered aerosol-generating (aerosol generating medical procedures or AGMPs), where standard contact and droplet precautions are not sufficient to protect against aerosolized viral particles. Whereas many of these recommendations vary in the details, all published criteria in the literature now support the use of N95 masks and associated aerosolized droplet precautions with all aerosol-generating medical procedures, regardless of COVID-19 testing. Many guidelines go much farther, recommending PAPRs for all such cases . The question of whether this should be enacted relies on three central issues:\n【4】 - The expected rate of community viral burden in the province of practice. 2. The rate of asymptomatic infection.\n【5】 - The reliability of COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic patients.\n【6】 With respect to the first issue, we know that community transmission of COVID-19 is rising across Canada, and is now responsible for more than half of infections in the country . Projections vary widely, but according to the federal health minister, \"between 30 and 70 percent of Canadians could become infected with coronavirus\" . Countries that did not prepare for this scenario are now facing such consequences, including Italy which is battling a high rate of health worker infections and COVID-related deaths.\n【7】 With respect to the second issue, emerging data shows that asymptomatic infections may be much more common than previously thought. During the Centers for Disease Control, (CDC) investigation of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, 46.5% of infected individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing, and 17.9% of those infected never developed symptoms . This is in alignment with findings in children, which show that more than 15% of patients have asymptomatic infection . There is  ample data to show that active transmission of the virus occurs in asymptomatic persons .\n【8】 Finally, current methods of testing for the COVID-19 virus are not validated for use in asymptomatic persons. Departments of Public Health and the CDC have repeatedly warned about the false negative (and false positive) rate of nasal swabs in asymptomatic patients . Although a positive COVID-19 swab in an asymptomatic patient can be useful, a negative swab cannot be relied on to be accurate.\n【9】 The current COVID19 pandemic makes treating head and neck cancers even more challenging in terms of triaging patients and allocating limited surgical resources. Surgical oncologists worldwide have published recommendations about application and utilization of surgical resources in these challenging times . Head and neck surgeons have the difficult task of following chronically ill patients while at the same time mitigating the risk of person to person contact . In doing so, head and neck cancer survivors may be impacted negatively in terms of quality of life as well as disease recurrence detection . Further, those with tracheostomies or laryngeal stomas are at increased risk of transmission and spread of COVID-19 .\n【10】 In summary, we can conclude and/or infer the following from the available data: in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

The container is designed to facilitate admixture or dilution.\n【98】 -  table under HOW SUPPLIED for summary of content and characteristics of this concentrated solution.\n【99】 - The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for use as a single-dose injection following admixture or dilution.\n【100】 - The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25°C/77°F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period.\n【101】 - Dextrose Injection, USP is a parenteral fluid and nutrient replenisher.\n【102】 - Dextrose Injection, USP is chemically designated D-glucose monohydrate (C6H12O6 - H2O), a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula:\n【103】 Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H2O.\n【104】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【105】 - When administered intravenously, solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein sparing action. Dextrose Injection, USP undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.\n【106】 - Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production, respectively).\n【107】 - Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments, and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.\n【108】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【109】 There is limited information regarding Dextrose monohydrate injection (10%) Pharmacokinetics in the drug label.\n【110】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【111】 There is limited information regarding Dextrose monohydrate injection (10%) Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n【112】 # Clinical Studies\n【113】 There is limited information regarding Dextrose monohydrate injection (10%) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n【114】 # How Supplied\n【115】 - 10% Dextrose Injection, USP is supplied in single-dose, partial-fill, flexible containers as follows: a 500 mL volume in a 1000 mL container.  the following table.\n【116】 - Caloric value calculated on the basis of 3.4 kcal/g of dextrose, hydrous.\n【117】 Revised: June, 2010\n【118】 Printed in USA                             EN-2535\n【119】 Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA\n【120】 ## Storage\n【121】 - Store at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).\n【122】 - Protect from freezing.\n【123】 # Images\n【124】 ## Drug Images\n【125】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【126】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【127】 There is limited information regarding Dextrose monohydrate injection (10%) Patient Counseling Information in the drug label.\n【128】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【129】 Alcohol-Dextrose monohydrate injection (10%) interaction has not been established.

Indinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.\n【4】 Antiretroviral Activity In Vitro:\n【5】 The in vitro activity of indinavir was assessed in cell lines of lymphoblastic and monocytic origin and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. HIV-1 variants used to infect the different cell types include laboratory-adapted variants, primary clinical isolates and clinical isolates resistant to nucleoside analogue and nonnucleoside inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The IC95 (95% inhibitory concentration) of indinavir in these test systems was in the range of 25 to 100 nM. In drug combination studies with the nucleoside analogues zidovudine and didanosine, indinavir showed synergistic activity in cell culture. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV-1 to indinavir and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not been established.\n【6】 Drug Resistance:\n【7】 Isolates of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been recovered from some patients treated with indinavir. Viral resistance was correlated with the accumulation of mutations that resulted in the expression of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease. Eleven amino acid residue positions, (L10l/V/R, K20l/M/R, L24l, M46l/L, l54A/V, L63P, l64V, A71T/V, V82A/F/T, l84V, and L90M), at which substitutions are associated with resistance, have been identified. Resistance was mediated by the co-expression of multiple and variable substitutions at these positions. No single substitution was either necessary or sufficient for measurable resistance (≥4-fold increase in IC. In general, higher levels of resistance were associated with the co-expression of greater numbers of substitutions, although their individual effects varied and were not additive. At least 3 amino acid substitutions must be present for phenotypic resistance to indinavir to reach measurable levels. In addition, mutations in the p7/ p1 and p1/ p6 gag cleavage sites were observed in some indinavir resistant HIV-1 isolates.\n【8】 In vitro phenotypic susceptibilities to indinavir were determined for 38 viral isolates from 13 patients who experienced virologic rebounds during indinavir monotherapy. Pre-treatment isolates from five patients exhibited indinavir IC95 values of 50-100 nM. At or following viral RNA rebound (after 12-76 weeks of therapy), IC95 values ranged from 25 to >3000 nM, and the viruses carried 2 to 10 mutations in the protease gene relative to baseline.\n【9】 Cross-Resistance to Other Antiviral Agents:\n【10】 Varying degrees of HIV-1 cross-resistance have been observed between indinavir and other HIV-1 protease inhibitors. In studies with ritonavir, saquinavir, and amprenavir, the extent and spectrum of cross-resistance varied with the specific mutational patterns observed. In general, the degree of cross-resistance increased with the accumulation of resistance-associated amino acid substitutions. Within a panel of 29 viral isolates from indinavir-treated patients that exhibited measurable (≥4-fold) phenotypic resistance to indinavir, all were resistant to ritonavir. Of the indinavir resistant HIV-1 isolates, 63% showed resistance to saquinavir and 81% to amprenavir.\n", "seq_id": 14832, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 02:13:31"}

In dogs, no LD50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes.\n【88】 ### Management\n【89】 - Gastric lavage and supportive therapy. Consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended.\n【90】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【91】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Metaxalone in the drug label.\n【92】 # Pharmacology\n【93】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【94】 - The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber.\n【95】 ## Structure\n【96】 - Metaxalone is available as an 800 mg, light pink to pink, capsule shaped, scored uncoated tablet.\n【97】 - Chemically, metaxalone is 5--2-oxazolidinone. The empirical formula is C12H15NO3, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 221.25. The structural formula is:\n【98】 - Metaxalone is a white to almost white, odorless crystalline powder freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in methanol and in 96% ethanol, but practically insoluble in ether or water.\n【99】 - Each tablet contains 800 mg metaxalone and the following inactive ingredients: calcium carbonate, FD&C Red #40, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, silicone dioxide, sodium starch glycolate and sodium stearyl fumarate.\n【100】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【101】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Metaxalone in the drug label.\n【102】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【103】 - The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg.\n【104】 - Absorption\n【105】 - Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 ± 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known.\n【106】 - The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in\n【107】 - Food Effects\n【108】 - A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 ± 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC∞) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was  delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted.\n【109】 - In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6± 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC∞) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was  delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal .\n【110】 - Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion\n【111】 - Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2. of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone.\n【112】 - Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro.\n【113】 - Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations\n【114】 - Age:\n【115】 - The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age.\n【116】 - The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in\n【117】 - Gender:\n【118】 - The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by Cmax (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC∞ (17884 ng·h/mL versus 10328 ng·h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were  seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis.\n【119】 - Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency:\n【120】 - The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment.\n【121】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【122】 There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Metaxalone in the drug label.\n【123】 # Clinical Studies\n【124】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Metaxalone in the drug label.\n【125】 # How Supplied\n【126】 - Metaxalone is available as an 800 mg, light pink to pink, capsule shaped, scored uncoated  tablet with debossing ‘AN’ on the left side of the scoring and ‘553’ on the right side of the scoring.

Current recommendations are to prophylactically anti-coagulate everyone hospitalized with a COVID-19 illness. 4 Non-hormonal contraceptives (copper intrauterine device) and progesterone-only methods of contraception (POP, LNG-IUS, DMPA and progestin implants) are not associated with an increased risk of VTE 5 and require no modification to their ongoing use in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization.\n【4】 Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are associated with a 2-to 3-fold increase in VTE compared to non-users, with the highest risk in the first year of use. 6 Baseline risk of VTE in reproductive age women not using COCs is 4-5/10,000-woman years, compared to 10/10,000 woman years in COC users. This is in comparison to the relative risk of 6.7 of VTE in pregnancy and 115.1 in the postpartum period. 6 Contextualizing this risk against the risk of a pregnancy complicated by COVID-19 illness is crucial. In pregnant women with a COVID-19 illness, current data show a 7-10% rate of ICU admission, 3.4% rate of mechanical ventilation and 1% maternal mortality rate. 7 The rate of VTE in pregnant women with COVID-19 is not established yet, with only a handful of case reports so far. 8,9,10,11 Given the elevated risk of VTE associated with pregnancy and postpartum compared to CHC use, as well as the risks of pregnancy complicated by COVID-19 illness, continued use of CHCs (pill, patch or ring) in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization represents a balanced harm reduction approach.\n【5】 Women who are positive for COVID-19 illness with asymptomatic or mild illness can initiate any form of contraception, including combined hormonal contraceptives. Women who are positive for COVID-19 illness with moderate or severe illness requiring hospitalization can initiate non-hormonal or progesterone-only methods of contraception, with a transition to combined hormonal contraceptives (pill, patch, ring) at time of discharge, if desired.\n【6】 # Asymptomatic and mild illness not requiring hospitalization\n【7】 There is currently no available evidence associating asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 illnesses not requiring hospitalization with an increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. 1,2 In this context, initiating any form of contraception, including estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives, is safe. The usual Medical Eligibility Criteria for each method apply. As outlined earlier in this guideline, women initiating combined hormonal contraceptives (pill, patch, ring) who are otherwise at low risk of cardiovascular disease, can initiate without a blood pressure assessment. A blood pressure should be assessed as soon as it is clinically feasible.\n【8】 # Moderate to severe illness requiring hospitalization\n【9】 Non-hormonal contraceptives (copper intrauterine device) and progesterone-only methods of contraception (POP, LNG-IUS, DMPA and progestin implants) are not associated with an increased risk of VTE 5 and can be initiated in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization.\n【10】 As outlined above, COC use is associated with a 2-to 3-fold increase in VTE risk from baseline, with the highest risk within the first year of use. While women with COVID-19 who have already initiated this as their chosen form of contraception may continue instead of stopping and re-starting CHCs, women who are choosing to initiate contraception at the time of moderate to severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization should consider non-hormonal or progesterone-only methods first.\n【11】 The risk of VTE associated with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization returns to baseline at discharge from hospital. 12 Current recommendations are to halt prophylactic anticoagulation at the time of discharge. 4,13 Given this return to baseline VTE risk, women desiring to initiate combined hormonal contraception or transition from another method can do so safely at this time.\n【12】 # Women who are positive for COVID-19 infection can use any form of emergency contraception, regardless of illness severity.\n【13】 There are no absolute contraindications to the use of emergency contraception aside from pregnancy and hypersensitivity. 14 Even women with contraindications to the use of CHCs can safely use hormonal EC methods. 14 Women with any severity of COVID-19 illness can safely use any of the currently available methods for emergency contraception in Canada.\n", "seq_id": 1112, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 00:10:58"}

It is only recommended if the conditions in the managed access agreement for trastuzumab deruxtecan are followed.\n【4】 This recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\n【5】 Why the committee made these recommendations\n【6】 Standard treatment for HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer includes anti-HER2 treatments. After first-line treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, standard treatment is trastuzumab emtansine. Trastuzumab deruxtecan would be an alternative anti-HER2 treatment after trastuzumab and a taxane.\n【7】 Clinical trial evidence shows that trastuzumab deruxtecan increases how long people have before their cancer gets worse compared with trastuzumab emtansine.\n【8】 There is not enough evidence yet to show if people live longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with trastuzumab emtansine because the clinical trial is still ongoing. This means the cost-effectiveness estimates are highly uncertain and trastuzumab deruxtecan cannot be recommended for routine use in the NHS.\n【9】 Trastuzumab deruxtecan could be cost effective if further evidence shows that people live longer with treatment. Evidence from the trial and from NHS practice could help address the uncertainty about how long people live. So, trastuzumab deruxtecan is recommended for use with managed access.# Information about trastuzumab deruxtecan\n【10】 # Marketing authorisation indication\n【11】 Trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu, Daiichi Sankyo) 'as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2‑positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens'.\n【12】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\n【13】 The dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for trastuzumab deruxtecan.\n【14】 The list price for trastuzumab deruxtecan is £1,455 per vial containing 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed October .\n【15】 The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes trastuzumab deruxtecan available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n【16】 The evaluation committee considered evidence submitted by Daiichi Sankyo, a review of this submission by the external assessment group (EAG), and responses from stakeholders.  the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n【17】 # The condition\n【18】 ## Details of the condition\n【19】 Some breast cancer cells have higher levels of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER on their surface which stimulates them to grow. This is known as HER2‑positive breast cancer and around 1 in 5 unresectable or metastatic breast cancers are HER2‑positive. The patient experts explained that being diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic breast cancer is extremely difficult for people and their family and friends. Many people feel uncertain, upset, and anxious, which can negatively affect mental health. People with unresectable or metastatic breast cancer have to organise their lives around hospital appointments and scans, which can constrain their everyday activities. There is no cure for unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. Treatment aims to stop progression of the disease, extend life, and maintain or improve quality of life for as long as possible. Treatment is continued for as long as it works. The committee concluded that there is a high disease burden for people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.\n【20】 # Clinical management\n【21】 ## Clinical need\n【22】 Clinical and patient experts explained that people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who have had treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane have a high symptom burden. There is an unmet need for treatments that control disease progression, extend life, and have an acceptable safety profile. First-line treatment of HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer includes the anti-HER2 treatments pertuzumab and trastuzumab with docetaxel  NICE's technology appraisal guidance on pertuzumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel for treating HER2-positive breast cancer), or trastuzumab with paclitaxel  NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer). Trastuzumab emtansine is an anti-HER2 treatment used at second line  NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab emtansine for treating HER2-positive advanced breast cancer after trastuzumab and a taxane). Non-targeted chemotherapy can  be used at second line  NICE's guideline on advanced breast cancer: diagnosis and treatment) but the clinical experts confirmed that trastuzumab emtansine is the current standard treatment. Patient and clinical experts explained that new treatments with improved outcomes are needed. Patient experts highlighted the need for new treatments with acceptable tolerability that can extend how long people live and improve quality of life. The committee concluded that that there is an unmet need for alternative anti-HER2 treatments after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments.\n【23】 ## Comparator\n【24】 The clinical experts confirmed that current standard care in the NHS for people with untreated HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer is trastuzumab and a taxane and that for second-line treatment current standard care is trastuzumab emtansine  section 3.. The committee concluded that trastuzumab emtansine is the relevant comparator for trastuzumab deruxtecan.\n【25】 # Clinical evidence\n【26】 ## Data source\n【27】 The clinical evidence was based on DESTINY‑Breast03, a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial for people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The trial was done in 169 centres in 15 countries, with a low number of people included from England. The EAG considered that this resulted in some uncertainty about how generalisable the DESTINY‑Breast03 results are to UK clinical practice. The clinical experts highlighted that the DESTINY‑Breast03 trial included people from different family backgrounds, including Asian and Black family backgrounds. The clinical experts confirmed that DESTINY‑Breast03 is generalisable to UK clinical practice. The committee concluded that, although there were low numbers of people in the trial from England, DESTINY‑Breast03 is generalisable to UK clinical practice.\n【28】 ## Subsequent treatments\n【29】 In its submission, the company explained that the proportion of people who had subsequent treatments in DESTINY‑Breast03 was higher than would be expected in NHS clinical practice based on its clinical expert opinion (the exact proportions are confidential and cannot be reported here). So, it assumed the proportion of people having subsequent treatments to be 66.7% in both the trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine arms, based on clinical expert opinion. In response to technical engagement, the company highlighted that its base case value is conservative, given that the same value is applied to both treatment arms. The EAG considered that there is uncertainty associated with clinical expert opinion but agreed the proportion of people having subsequent treatments should be 66.7% for both arms in the model. The committee acknowledged the uncertainty but concluded that an assumption that 66.7% of people would have subsequent treatments in both arms was acceptable for decision making.\n【30】 In its submission, the company used the same subsequent treatments from the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm and the trastuzumab emtansine arm of DESTINY‑Breast03 in its base case. The EAG considered that the subsequent treatment distributions from DESTINY‑Breast03 may not be reflective of the subsequent treatments used in NHS clinical practice. It considered that the subsequent treatments in the European subgroup in DESTINY‑Breast03 may be more applicable to NHS clinical practice. But it noted that the sample size for this subgroup is small and so is associated with uncertainty. In its response to technical engagement, the company provided 3 scenario analyses using different subsequent treatments based on: the European subgroup in DESTINY‑Breast03; UK clinical expert opinion; and the pooled subsequent treatment distribution from DESTINY‑Breast03. It noted these scenarios had a very small impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates and so it maintained its original base case using the subsequent treatment distributions directly from DESTINY‑Breast03. The EAG noted that using the scenario analyses provided by the company resulted in minor differences in the cost-effectiveness estimates. But each scenario was associated with uncertainty, and so it used the same estimates as in the company base case. The committee recognised the uncertainty, but it was satisfied that the various scenario analyses had a minor effect on the cost-effectiveness estimates. It concluded that using subsequent treatment distributions from DESTINY‑Breast03 was acceptable for decision making.\n【31】 ## Clinical effectiveness\n【32】 The primary endpoint of DESTINY‑Breast03 is progression-free survival, and overall survival is a secondary endpoint. At the May 2021 data cut-off, median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was not reached in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm compared with 6.8 months in the trastuzumab emtansine arm. The hazard ratio was 0.28 (p<0., showing trastuzumab deruxtecan was associated with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with trastuzumab emtansine. Median overall survival was not reached in either arm. The median follow up was 16.2 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm and 15.3 months in the trastuzumab emtansine arm. The clinical experts commented that it is rare for a treatment for metastatic breast cancer to demonstrate such a favourable hazard ratio for progression-free survival, and they would expect this to translate into an overall survival benefit. The committee concluded that based on the interim trial data, trastuzumab deruxtecan could be considered a promising treatment for people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments but that the evidence on long-term outcomes is limited.\n【33】 ## Long-term treatment effects\n【34】 The overall survival data from the DESTINY‑Breast03 study is immature. The median overall survival for both the trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine arms could not be estimated from the number of deaths at the May 2021 data cut-off. The clinical experts commented that they would expect the significant benefit in progression-free survival for trastuzumab deruxtecan to translate into a long-term survival benefit  section 3.. The company commented that progression-free survival is a good surrogate for overall survival. It said that trastuzumab deruxtecan was associated with a numerically lower risk of death compared with trastuzumab emtansine at the May 2021 data cut-off, with a hazard ratio of 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.. So, it assumed a long-term survival benefit for trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with trastuzumab emtansine in its base case. The EAG noted that because of the small number of deaths in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm of DESTINY‑Breast03, there is a high level of uncertainty associated with assuming a long-term survival benefit. The committee accepted that it is unlikely that there is no overall survival benefit at all compared with trastuzumab emtansine. But, because the data is immature, it concluded the size of any overall survival benefit for trastuzumab deruxtecan was highly uncertain, resulting in significant uncertainty in the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness estimates.\n【35】 ## Adverse events\n【36】 The committee noted that trastuzumab deruxtecan is associated with side effects, including interstitial lung disease (ILD). The clinical experts confirmed that trastuzumab deruxtecan is associated with side effects that need careful management. But they explained that trastuzumab deruxtecan is available in the NHS for HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer at a later line in the treatment pathway. This means there is experience of using trastuzumab deruxtecan in the NHS and clinicians can effectively monitor and manage side effects, including ILD. The clinical experts advised that there is clinical enthusiasm to use trastuzumab deruxtecan at an earlier line in the treatment pathway for people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. The patient experts commented that side effects do occur with trastuzumab deruxtecan and they can result in dose reductions, which make the side effects more manageable. But they explained that people will accept the side effects of trastuzumab deruxtecan given the benefit it may bring in reducing both tumour volume and symptoms. The committee concluded that trastuzumab deruxtecan is associated with side effects, which may impact on quality of life, but these are manageable for most people.\n【37】 # Cost-effectiveness evidence\n【38】 ## Company's modelling approach\n【39】 The company submitted a partitioned survival model to estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with trastuzumab emtansine. It has 3 health states: progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death. The committee considered that the partitioned survival model is a standard approach to estimate cost effectiveness of cancer drugs and is suitable for decision making.\n【40】 ## Progression-free survival\n【41】 The company fitted independent Weibull models to Kaplan–Meier curves to estimate progression-free survival in both arms. The EAG noted that the progression-free survival estimates from DESTINY‑Breast03 that were used to inform long-term extrapolations of progression-free survival in the economic model were associated with uncertainty because the data was immature. The EAG acknowledged that alternative extrapolations of the data only have a small effect on the cost-effectiveness estimates. The committee concluded that the company's approach to estimating progression-free survival was appropriate.\n【42】 ## Long-term overall survival\n【43】 In its submission, the company assumed a long-term survival benefit for trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with trastuzumab emtansine  sections 3.7 and 3.. In its base case, the company extrapolated overall survival beyond the end of the trial follow-up period using parametric survival models. The log-logistic model provided the best statistical fit to the DESTINY‑Breast03 trial data. But the company chose the generalised gamma curve for its base case based on clinical expert opinion. The EAG noted that there is considerable uncertainty in the company's predicted survival for trastuzumab deruxtecan. The company's extrapolated overall survival curve for trastuzumab deruxtecan relies on the assumption that the trend in overall survival seen within the trial will continue beyond the follow-up period. The EAG considered this an uncertain assumption given the immature survival data in DESTINY‑Breast03. It recognised that there is some separation of the overall survival curves between trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine. But it commented that there is insufficient evidence to prove a long-term difference in overall survival between them, in particular, if there is a continued benefit during disease progression after treatment has stopped. It commented that there is no survival data post-progression, meaning that it is not clear if there is a treatment effect after disease progression. In its base case, the EAG preferred an assumption that there is no survival benefit after progression. Instead, it used the estimated overall survival from the company's base case for the first 2 years and then adjusted the overall survival beyond 2 years. It used 2 years as the point to adjust overall survival because only 24 people were still in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm of the trial by 2 years. This method consisted of increasing the mortality hazard ratio according to the implied progression-free survival mortality rate that was derived from the generalised gamma overall survival curve fitted for trastuzumab deruxtecan. The EAG assumed no difference in effectiveness between trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine in the progressed disease state beyond 2 years. At technical engagement, the company provided an alternative methodology incorporating further long-term data. Data was replicated from the trastuzumab emtansine arm of the EMILIA study, which compared trastuzumab emtansine with lapatinib and capecitabine. It had a median follow up of 47.8 months. Parametric survival models were fitted to the replicated data to inform the trastuzumab emtansine overall survival. The hazard ratio from DESTINY‑Breast03 was then applied to this curve to inform the trastuzumab deruxtecan overall survival. This alternative method resulted in similar cost-effectiveness estimates to the company's base case. The committee noted that only a small number of deaths occurred during the follow-up period of DESTINY‑Breast03. So, the long-term extrapolation of overall survival for trastuzumab deruxtecan is highly uncertain, with no data currently available to inform which extrapolation method is most appropriate. The committee concluded that the modelling of overall survival was highly uncertain and further data collection was needed to inform overall survival with trastuzumab deruxtecan.\n【44】 ## Utility values\n【45】 In its submission, the company noted that the number of post-progression observations from DESTINY‑Breast03 were limited. It  highlighted that post-progression utility values taken directly from the trial were implausibly high in comparison to previously accepted progressed disease utility values within the same population, based on clinical opinion. So, it used utility values which were derived from coefficients of the mixed model analysis from Lloyd . The company assumed that people who progress while on trastuzumab deruxtecan would have a better quality of life compared with those who progress while on trastuzumab emtansine. This is because of improved response rates and improved disease control. The EAG raised concerns about using Lloyd  to calculate coefficients for the utility values weighted by responder and non-responder from the DESTINY‑Breast03 trial. It noted Lloyd  does not provide any evidence for difference in utility values for people who have progressed after responding to initial treatment. It provides evidence for people who currently respond to treatment before progression. The EAG commented it could not find any evidence for a difference in utility values after progression. At technical engagement, the company provided scenario analyses as an alternative to assuming a utility benefit for trastuzumab deruxtecan across the entire progressed disease state. Instead, the difference in utility lasts for 4 or 6 months after progression, then the same utility value is assumed for both trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine. The committee noted the company's rationale that people on trastuzumab deruxtecan would have a higher quality of life post-progression than people on trastuzumab emtansine because of improved response rates and disease control. But the committee considered that there is no direct trial evidence to support such a utility benefit. It concluded that there was no direct evidence of a utility benefit post-progression and that post-progression utility values should be independent of previous treatment.\n【46】 ## Vial sharing\n【47】 In its submission, the company assumed that vial sharing is available in some UK centres. In its base case, the company assumed 50% vial sharing in line with the assumptions accepted in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on sacituzumab govitecan for treating unresectable triple-negative advanced breast cancer after 2 or more therapies and NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab deruxtecan for treating HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 2 or more anti-HER2 therapies. The EAG commented that 50% vial sharing could be an overestimate and that if vial sharing is carried out it is unlikely there would be perfect allocation of each dose. So, it preferred to use 10% vial sharing in its base case. The NHS England Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead confirmed that vial sharing is encouraged by NHS England and that they expected vial sharing to occur regularly for trastuzumab deruxtecan because of dose banding, in which individual doses are rounded up or down. They commented that they would expect vial sharing to occur in at least 50% of cases. The committee concluded that vial sharing should be assumed to occur in 50% of cases.\n【48】 # Severity\n【49】 ## QALY weighting\n【50】 In its submission, the company provided evidence that HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments is a severe condition. The severity modifier allows the committee to give more weight to health benefits in the most severe conditions. The company provided absolute and proportional quality-adjusted life year . The EAG preferred to cross-walk EQ‑5D‑5L to EQ‑5D‑3L using the Hernández-Alava  algorithm which resulted in values for absolute QALY shortfall of less than 12 and a proportional QALY shortfall of less than 0.85. So, the EAG base case suggested that a severity QALY weighting does not apply (the exact QALYs, and the absolute and proportional QALY shortfalls, are confidential so cannot be reported here). The committee discussed the methods used by the company and the EAG to estimate the remaining lifetime QALYs for the general population and for people living with the condition. It noted NICE's position statement on the use of the EQ-5D-5L value set and was  aware that NICE's health technology evaluations manual states a preference for Hernández-Alava , as used by the ERG to cross-walk EQ‑5D‑5L to EQ‑5D‑3L. It considered there was high uncertainty around the methods used to estimate the remaining lifetime QALYs for the general population and for people living with the condition. The committee noted that the modifier for disease severity was not convincingly met but recognised that there were plausible cost-effectiveness estimates below £30,000 per QALY gained when the QALY weight was not applied and when the 1.2 QALY weight was applied. The committee concluded that it is uncertain whether the modifier for disease severity was convincingly met, but recognised it was met in some scenarios.\n【51】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n【52】 ## Company and EAG cost-effectiveness estimates\n【53】 Because of confidential discounts for trastuzumab deruxtecan, trastuzumab emtansine and subsequent treatments, the cost-effectiveness results are commercial in confidence and cannot be reported here. The committee preferred an analysis that included:\n【54】 % of people having subsequent treatments in both arms\n【55】 the distributions of subsequent treatments from DESTINY‑Breast03\n【56】 treatment-independent post-progression utility values\n【57】 vial sharing in 50% of cases.The committee recalled the uncertainty in how the survival benefit of trastuzumab deruxtecan was modelled and that further data collection was needed to inform overall survival with trastuzumab deruxtecan  section 3.8 and section 3.. Using the committee's preferred assumptions and the company's preferred overall survival extrapolation resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) above £30,000 per QALY gained. But the committee noted that using the committee's preferred assumptions with different methods of extrapolating overall survival resulted in ICERs below £30,000 per QALY gained. The committee considered these scenarios were plausible but uncertain. Using the committee's preferred assumptions and the EAG's preferred overall survival extrapolation, which assumed no long-term survival benefit for trastuzumab deruxtecan, resulted in an ICER that was above £30,000 per QALY gained. The committee agreed that this ICER is not implausible, because of the high degree of uncertainty of the long-term overall survival benefit of trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with trastuzumab emtansine. This is mainly related to the immaturity of the overall survival data. The committee recognised that the evidence base was immature and the most plausible cost-effectiveness estimates for trastuzumab deruxtecan are highly uncertain. It concluded that with the available data, the most plausible ICER had not been proven to be within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of resources, even when the severity modifier was applied. So, it concluded that trastuzumab deruxtecan could not be recommended for routine commissioning.\n【58】 # Managed access\n【59】 ## Recommendation with managed access\n【60】 Having concluded that trastuzumab deruxtecan could not be recommended for routine use, the committee then considered if it could be recommended with managed access for treating HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments. The committee considered whether a recommendation with managed access could be made, and discussed that:\n【61】 There is plausible potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use:\n【62】 the committee considered there are plausible ICERs below £30,000 per QALY both when the modifier for disease severity is applied and when it is not applied\n【63】 the company's model is structurally robust for decision making  section 3..\n【64】 The key uncertainties relate to overall survival, which is a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results.\n【65】 New evidence could address the clinical uncertainty:\n【66】 data from DESTINY‑Breast03 is immature because only a small percentage of those recruited had had an event by the May 2021 data cut-off. The trial is ongoing and further data could help reduce uncertainties around long-term progression-free survival and overall survival\n【67】 the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy dataset could provide meaningful real-world data about time on treatment and overall survival for trastuzumab deruxtecan in the NHS.\n【68】 The company submitted a managed access proposal and expressed an interest in trastuzumab deruxtecan being considered for funding through managed access. The managed access feasibility assessment noted that trastuzumab deruxtecan would likely be eligible for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund.The committee considered that trastuzumab deruxtecan met the criteria to be considered for a recommendation with managed access. It recommended trastuzumab deruxtecan for use in managed access as an option for people with HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer, after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments, if the conditions in the managed access agreement are followed. When the guidance is next reviewed the company should use the committee's preferred assumptions (unless new evidence indicates otherwise) as set out in sections 3.4 to 3.15.\n【69】 ## Innovation\n【70】 The company, patient experts and clinical experts considered trastuzumab deruxtecan to be innovative. They explained that it would be a step-change in improving clinical outcomes and managing HER2‑positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 1 or more anti-HER2 treatments. The committee considered whether trastuzumab deruxtecan was innovative. It did not identify additional benefits of trastuzumab deruxtecan not captured in the economic modelling. So, the committee concluded that all additional benefits of trastuzumab deruxtecan had already been taken into account.\n", "seq_id": 1266, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:00:39"}

While early repolarization has been long considered a normal benign ECG variant, some studies suggest an association between early repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Moreover, early repolarization pattern must be differentiated from early repolarization syndrome as the former is strictly an EKG finding whereas the latter represents a symptomatic situation of cardiac arrest or syncope following the occurrence of an early repolarization pattern. Early repolarization can be confused with STEMI and pericarditis.\n【4】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【5】 - Early repolarization pattern has been considered benign for a long time until some studies suggested an association between early repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia, particularly ventricular fibrillation. A possible explanation of the increased vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation associated with early repolarization is that early repolarization might be an indicator of transmural repolarization heterogeneity.\n【6】 - This association has shed light on the importance of evaluating early repolarization patterns and their prognostic implications. Whereas early repolarization is a common finding, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a rare entity which incidence ranges from 3:100000 to 10:100000.\n【7】 The majority of early repolarization patterns, especially if incidentally found in otherwise asymptomatic people with a negative family history, have no or minimal increased risk of arrhythmia.\n【8】 Early repolarization carries a higher risk of arrhythmia in patients with underlying cardiac pathology.\n【9】 Early repolarization is rarely associated with a primary arrythmogenic disorder that manifests as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Genetic predisposition seems to play a role in this group of people. In addition, early repolarization seems to cause arrhythmia during sleep or at rest in the absence of any physical activity.\n【10】 - The majority of early repolarization patterns, especially if incidentally found in otherwise asymptomatic people with a negative family history, have no or minimal increased risk of arrhythmia.\n【11】 - Early repolarization carries a higher risk of arrhythmia in patients with underlying cardiac pathology.\n【12】 - Early repolarization is rarely associated with a primary arrythmogenic disorder that manifests as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Genetic predisposition seems to play a role in this group of people. In addition, early repolarization seems to cause arrhythmia during sleep or at rest in the absence of any physical activity.\n【13】 - In addition, early repolarization seems to have different patterns which have different clinical significance. Hence, a standardized evaluation of early repolarization is needed. Early repolarization patterns that demonstrate a rapidly ascending ST segment after the J point are almost always benign.\n【14】 - A case control study of 120 post MI patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) demonstrated that early repolarization was more frequently observed among patients with documented episodes of ventricular fibrillation (32% vs. 8%, p=0.. The leads demonstrating early repolarization were more often the inferior leads (23% vs. 8%, p=0.. A trend was observed for the lateral leads (V4-V as well (12% vs. 3%, p=0.. In contrast, leads I and aVL were not commonly involved (3% vs. 0%).  The morphology of the ST segment was critical and a notch in the ST segment was observed more frequently among patients with ventricular fibrillation (28% vs. 7%, p=0..  In contrast, J-point elevation and slurring of the ST segment surprisingly were not associated with ventricular arrhythmias.\n【15】 # Differential Diagnosis\n【16】 ## Early Repolarization Syndrome\n【17】 - The terms early repolarization and early repolarization syndrome must be differentiated. Early repolarization is a term used to describe changes noted on ECG regardless of the presence or absence of any symptoms. Early repolarization syndrome is the presence of cardiac arrest, and less frequently syncope, in the absence of any other cause that can explain the early repolarization changes on ECG. The diagnosis of early repolarization syndrome requires ruling out other etiologies that might be responsible for the ECG changes.\n【18】 - In addition, the symptoms associated with early repolarization syndrome immediately follow the ECG changes.\n【19】 ## Other Causes of ST Elevation\n【20】 Early repolarization must be differentiated from other causes of ST elevation including STEMI and pericarditis.\n【21】 - The ST segment elevation of early repolarization is exacerbated by bradycardia, carotid sinus massage and vagal maneuvers. This is not true in STEMI or pericarditis.\n【22】 - Early repolarization is characterized by a notch at the J point which is not a characteristic finding in STEMI or pericarditis. Shown below is an image demonstrating a characteristic notch which is present at the J point in early repolarization.\n【23】 - The height of the J point can be used to differentiate early repolarization from other conditions. Only lead V6 is used to distinguish between early repolarization and pericarditis. As shown in the image below, if A/B > 25%, pericarditis should be suspected. If A/B < 25%, early repolarization is more probable.\n【24】 # EKG Examples\n【25】 Shown below is an EKG demonstrating J point elevation, concave shaped up-sloping ST segment, and prominent T waves in the inferior and lateral leads depicting benign early repolarization.\n【26】 Shown below is an EKG demonstrating notching of the J point in the lateral leads depicting early repolarization.\n【27】 Shown below are examples of EKG depicting early repolarization and other normal variants of ST elevation.\n", "seq_id": 16613, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 22:37:15"}

It is closely related to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax which are responsible for most malarial infection.  It is a so-called \"benign malaria\" and is not nearly as dangerous as that produced by P. falciparum or P. vivax.  P. malariae causes fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals (a quartan fever), longer than the two-day intervals of the other malarial parasites.\n【4】 Microscopically, the parasitised red blood cell (erythrocyte) is never enlarged and may even appear smaller than that of normal red blood cells.  The cytoplasm is not decolorized and no dots are visible on the cell surface.  The food vacuole is small and the parasite is compact.  Cells seldom host more than one parasite.  Band forms, where the parasite forms a thick band across the width of the infected cell, are characteristic of this species (and some would say is diagnostic).  Large grains of malarial pigment are often seen in these parasites: more so than any other Plasmodium species.  8 merozoites\n【5】 P. vivax and P. ovale that has been sitting in EDTA for more than half-an-hour before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to P. malariae, which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives.\n【6】 hr:Plasmodium malariae\n", "seq_id": 17971, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#1#2#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#6#6#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 23:42:00"}

It shares similarities with other forms of divination such as tarot, the I Ching and the Kabbalah, and many of the concepts from Jungian psychology and other studies of mythology have  been related to the system. While not claiming healing in the sense of Acupuncture or other remedial systems, practitioners regard it as able to help identify the answer to what lies behind disease (referred to as dis-ease).\n【2】 The central idea of Aura-Soma is that colour is a unifying universal language which relates to all other theologies and schools of psychology. It is part of the underlying order of the universe. Colour is a means by which connections can be made, with each colour relating to a different aspect of life. Practitioners attach great spiritual significance and psychological connotations to colour combinations chosen by an individual.\n【3】 In traditional systems, such as the Chakras, colour is related to the different parts of the body and their underlying physical structure. Each of these physical attributes in turn is related to emotional, mental and spiritual states.\n【4】 Colour combinations are represented by two-tone bottles known as equilibrium bottles. These bottles are made from two colours of organic oil and water (usually two different colours, but some bottles are monotone). Each bottle represents a series of symbolic, spiritual, mental, emotional and physical concepts defined by its two colours. The bottles are numbered from 0 to 105 (currently, more are being regularly added), and each has a name. The bottles are named after associated series of figures, such as the major arcana of the Tarot and the Seven Archangels.\n【5】 # History\n【6】 The first Aura-Soma Equilibrium bottle was brought forth by Vicky Wall in 1983. She was 66 years old at the time and had become clinically blind. Wall claimed she could see auras around people, plants and animals and  that she had retained this ability even after the loss of her vision. Ms. Wall developed the coloured bottle system and asserted that the selection by the user may reveal their gifts, challenges and opportunities.\n【7】 Over time the colour care system has come to include pomanders, oils, essences and sprays, all colour-related. These items are not held to have strict medical use, they are symbolic in nature. The theory being that if the practitioner can draw the state of mind of a client out through colour, then the application of appropriate colour in the life of the client can  have a restorative or healing psychosomatic effect.\n【8】 Aura-Soma is looked upon by its practitioners as a constantly developing system. New bottles and methods are added to the system on an infrequent basis. In addition it is thought to reflect what is emerging for the collective as well as individuals.\n【9】 After the initial start in 1983, Aura-Soma spread from the UK, becoming established in Denmark, Germany, the United States, Australia, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Korea, China and South America.\n【10】 # Practice\n【11】 The standard divination process for Aura-Soma is based on the equilibrium bottles. The user picks four bottles one after another while faced with the full selection to choose from, and the practitioner then interprets the meaning of their selection. The order in which they are chosen is important:\n【12】 - The first bottle represents the self, or a description of the user's current state of being\n【13】 - The second represents the user's hidden gifts as well as their biggest obstacles\n【14】 - The third represents their present energy, which gives a method which can be used to overcome their obstacles\n【15】 - The fourth represents the energy that they are drawing toward them; the future that they are trying to create for themselves though overcoming the obstacles.\n【16】 Afterwards, the user picks one of the four bottles which they use as an ointment, by shaking the bottle and applying the fusion of the oil and water to the parts of their body whose Chakras correspond to the colours of the bottle. This aids them with one area of disease which will help them achieve the outcome of the four bottle spread. Since much emphasis is on the obstacle, the second bottle is usually chosen.\n【17】 While sounding superficially like the processes of other systems like Tarot, practitioners of Aura-Soma do not regard it as fortune-telling, but instead to be more like a counselling method, similar to the Lüscher color test, Rorschach inkblot test and other similar psychological methods of accessing the unconscious mind as separate to the conscious mind. Aura-Soma is not, however, a science or branch of psychology.\n【18】 # Practitioners and Teachers\n【19】 There is an Aura-Soma Code of Practice that is regulated by the Art & Science International Academy of Colour Therapeutics (ASIACT). ASIACT maintains a practitioner register and issues certificates to those who work according to this code. Each certificate is valid for two years. A current certificate shows that the practitioner is continuing to be updated in the Aura-Soma system and works according to the practices set out by the Academy.\n【20】 Practitioner training currently comprises 4 levels. Levels 1, 2 and 3 each involve attendance at an accredited course.  Each level involves broader and more detailed instruction in Aura-Soma. Level 4 involves the completion of a piece of original research on colour, together with presentation of a required number of case records and researched responses to colour related questions. A practitioner's level of training is featured on their certificate.\n【21】 Students may become practitioners at any time after the completion of Level 2, regulated by laid down guidelines. At Level 4 the practitioner has demonstrated experience of working with Aura-Soma and understanding of the principles of Aura-Soma and may develop a full public practice. Practitioners and teachers can be found at the ASIACT website.\n【22】 The bottle system is now governed by a central company (called Aura-Soma Products LTD) and the term 'Aura-Soma' is a registered trademark of that company. It is currently managed by Mike Booth.\n", "seq_id": 29499, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 00:18:43"}

Clemetson\n【1】 Charles Alan Blake \"Alan\" Clemetson MD, F.R.C.O.G., F.R.C.S.(C), F.A.C.O.G. (October 31 1923 – August 30  was a medical doctor, scientist and researcher who published over 48 medical papers and a three-volume monograph, Vitamin C. During his hospital and teaching career he specialised in obstetrics and gynecology. After retirement in 1991 he devoted his time to researching and publishing papers on Barlow's disease (scurvy in infants), particularly arguing this to be the major cause of Shaken baby syndrome.\n【2】 # Biography\n【3】 Dr. Clemetson was born in Canterbury, England, attending Wootton Court preparatory school, Wootton, Kent  and The King's School, Canterbury . After preclinical studies at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, he completed his training at Radcliffe Infirmary, graduating from Oxford University in 1948 with a Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (B.M., B.Ch) degree.\n【4】 He married Helen Cowan Forster, a physiotherapist, on March 29, 1947. They had four children.\n【5】 After graduation, he became a Royal Air Force medical officer for two years, and then returned to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in Obstetrics, he started to pursue research into preeclamptic toxaemia and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1951-1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either Obstetrics or Gynecology, and, in 1956, became a lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London University.\n【6】 Dr. Clemetson immigrated to Saskatoon, Canada (1958 -, becoming an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Saskatoon. During this period he began to be interested in vitamin C, on an expedition to Rankin Inlet, Hudson Bay, when he was impressed by the good capillary strength of the local Inuit, surmising this to be due to raw fish in their diet.\n【7】 Then, in 1961, he moved to California and assumed a position as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, and a lecturer in the Department of Maternal and Child Health with the University of California, Berkeley.\n【8】 In 1967, he assumed a teaching position (1967– as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology with the State University of New York, Brooklyn. He  became the Director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department  at the Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. In addition , he served as a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York, Brooklyn, New York.\n【9】 Dr. Clemetson in 1981 moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, and became a professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tulane University School of Medicine, and the Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Huey P. Long Memorial Hospital, Pineville, Louisiana. He  became a consultant in Gynecology for the Department of Surgery, Veterans Administration Hospital, Pineville, Louisiana.\n【10】 Upon his retirement in 1991, as a Professor Emeritus, Tulane University School of Medicine, Dr. Clemetson devoted his remaining years to writing and publishing medical papers concerning Shaken baby syndrome.\n【11】 Near the end of his life he narrowly escaped the New Orleans disaster from Hurricane Katrina, having been warned by the meteorologist brother-in-law of his carer. He escaped with the latter over the Lake Pontchartrain bridge the day before it was destroyed. He lived in Houston, Texas for nearly a year while his family restored his house, but died of heart failure a few weeks after this was completed.\n【12】 # Achievements\n【13】 Dr. Clemetson had a long and distinguished academic career as a medical doctor, scientist and researcher. During his forty year professional career, he implemented numerous scientific studies and was instrumental in furthering scientific knowledge.\n【14】 The following listed achievements are highlights of his life’s work that are contained in his extensive Curriculum Vitae.\n【15】 Dr. Clemetson's most notable medico-legal achievement was as the father of the “Motherhood Bill”, which requires that all medical insurance carriers in the State of New York include coverage for pregnancy and complications of pregnancy. This so-called Donovan Bill rapidly spread to all 50 states.\n【16】 - University College Hospital – London – 1950-1952 / 1956-1958\n【17】 Demonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of preeclampsia on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants.\n【18】 Published the first study of “small-for-dates” infants in his studies of “the difference in birth weight of human twins.”\n【19】 Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in preeclampsia.\n【20】 Demonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early preeclampsia.\n【21】 Performed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital.\n【22】 University of California Medical Center – San Francisco – 1961–1967\n【23】 Bioflavonoids and catechins - Solved the old “Vitamin P” problem, by showing that bioflavonoids with certain structural characteristics act as indirect antioxidants for Vitamin C.

Mallikarjuneswara and Moshfeghi, he was able to measure the electrical charge on fertilized rat ova, and this was the first time that anyone had ever measured the electrical charge on any mammalian ovum.\n【29】 He showed conclusively that women on the pill need more Vitamin C than usual, and, as a result of this, a special vitamin formula called “Feminins” was developed and marketed for women on the pill.\n【30】 His research on the uterine luminal fluid in the rat showed that estrogen causes secretion and progesterone causes reabsorption of uterine luminal fluid.\n【31】 In collaboration with Dr. J.K. Kim and others, he showed that the luteal phase of the human menstrual cycle is the reabsorptive phase, and not the secretory phase.\n【32】 In recent research, he has shown that people with low vitamin C levels have very high blood histamine levels.\n【33】 He was able to relate the above observation to abruptio placentae, as women with low ascorbate (Vitamin C) and high histamine levels are prone to develop premature separation of the placenta.\n【34】 Tulane University School of Medicine 1981–1990\n【35】 Wrote three-volume monograph, Vitamin C, published by CRC Press in 1989.\n【36】 - University College Hospital – London – 1950-1952 / 1956-1958\n【37】 Demonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of preeclampsia on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants.\n【38】 Published the first study of “small-for-dates” infants in his studies of “the difference in birth weight of human twins.”\n【39】 Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in preeclampsia.\n【40】 Demonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early preeclampsia.\n【41】 Performed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital.\n【42】 - Demonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of preeclampsia on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants.\n【43】 - Published the first study of “small-for-dates” infants in his studies of “the difference in birth weight of human twins.”\n【44】 - Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in preeclampsia.\n【45】 - Demonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early preeclampsia.\n【46】 - Performed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital.\n【47】 - University of California Medical Center – San Francisco – 1961–1967\n【48】 Bioflavonoids and catechins - Solved the old “Vitamin P” problem, by showing that bioflavonoids with certain structural characteristics act as indirect antioxidants for Vitamin C.

The mechanism he argued to be high histamine levels associated with low serum vitamin C, the latter deficiency arising before birth due to factors such as the pregnant mother's malnutrition, and in the infant by recurrent infections and recent multiple vaccinations.\n【75】 His four main papers on this topic, published in the journal Medical Hypotheses, are: The Key Role of Histamine in the Development of Atherosclerosis and Coronary heart disease; Barlow's disease  ; Capillary Fragility as a Cause of Subdural Hemorrhage in Infants ; and Elevated Blood Histamine Caused by Vaccinations and Vitamin C Deficiency May Mimic the Shaken Baby Syndrome .\n【76】 # Work cited\n【77】 Commission on Life Sciences - National Academies Press (USA)\n【78】 - Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition\n【79】 “Water Soluble Vitamins – Vitamin C” Chapter 8 p 115 Clemetson, C.A.B. 1980.

The recommendations originally included the InRatio2 PT/INR, but this was withdrawn from the market in October 2016 and is not currently available.\n【2】 # Recommendations\n【3】 The CoaguChek XS system is recommended for self‑monitoring coagulation status in adults and children on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease if:\n【4】 the person prefers this form of testing and\n【5】 the person or their carer is both physically and cognitively able to self‑monitor effectively.\n【6】 This recommendation has been removed because the InRatio2 PT/INR monitor is no longer available.\n【7】 Patients and carers should be trained in the effective use of the CoaguChek XS system and clinicians involved in their care should regularly review their ability to self‑monitor.\n【8】 Equipment for self‑monitoring should be regularly checked using reliable quality control procedures, and by testing patients' equipment against a healthcare professional's coagulometer which is checked in line with an external quality assurance scheme. Ensure accurate patient records are kept and shared appropriately.\n【9】 For people who may have difficulty with or who are unable to self‑monitor, such as children or people with disabilities, their carers should be considered to help with self‑monitoring.# The technologies\n【10】 Three CE‑marked point‑of‑care coagulometers for self‑monitoring coagulation status were identified during scoping as being relevant to this assessment. One of these coagulometers, the ProTime microcoagulation system, was included in the assessment but has been removed from this guidance because it is no longer available to the NHS and its successor model is not intended for patient self‑monitoring. Additional details of the coagulometers included in the guidance are provided in section 4.# Clinical need and practice\n【11】 # The problem addressed\n【12】 The point‑of‑care coagulometers are designed to monitor the clotting tendency of blood in people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy, such as those with atrial fibrillation or artificial heart valves who are at risk of thrombosis. The tests allow monitoring by 2 different methods of care: self‑testing and self‑managing. Both methods are based on the international normalised ratio (INR), which is a standardised unit for measuring the time it takes for blood to clot. Self‑testing refers to the user doing the INR test themselves and then contacting their healthcare professional with the reading for advice on any change to the dosage of the anticoagulant that may be needed. Self‑managing refers to the user doing the INR test themselves and then self‑adjusting the dosage of their anticoagulant medication by following an agreed care protocol. Together, these methods of care are referred to as self‑monitoring.\n【13】 The use of these coagulometers may reduce the frequency of visits to hospital or clinics for patients and enable them to be monitored more regularly. This may improve health outcomes by enabling the dose of therapy to be adjusted more accurately, thereby avoiding adverse events that can result from an over‑ or under‑dose of long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy, such as stroke and major haemorrhage.\n【14】 The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of using the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor for self‑monitoring (self‑testing or self‑managing) coagulation status in people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.\n【15】 # The condition\n【16】 There are a number of conditions that can result in people having an increased risk of thrombosis and consequently, receiving long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy. These conditions include atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease. Guidance on self‑monitoring the coagulation status of people who have had a venous thromboembolism and are receiving long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy is included in the NICE guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases and so this population is not included in the scope of this diagnostics assessment of self‑monitoring coagulometers.\n【17】 ## Atrial fibrillation\n【18】 Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart arrhythmia and affects around 800,000 people in the UK. It can affect adults of any age but it is more common in older people; 0.5% of people aged 50–59 years and around 8% of people aged over 65 years are estimated to be affected. Atrial fibrillation is  more common in men than women, and is more common in people with other conditions, such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis and heart valve problems.\n【19】 Approximately 47% of people with atrial fibrillation currently receive vitamin K antagonist therapy. It is estimated that a further 30% of people with atrial fibrillation could receive this therapy but currently do not. People with atrial fibrillation are at a 5–6 times greater risk of stroke, with 12,500 strokes directly attributable to atrial fibrillation occurring every year in the UK. Treatment with warfarin reduces this risk by 50–70%.\n【20】 ## Heart valve disease\n【21】 Valve disease can affect blood flow through the heart in 2 ways: valve stenosis, in which the valve does not open fully, and valve regurgitation (or incompetence) in which the valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak backwards. Disease can occur in any of the 4 heart valves, although disorders of the aortic and mitral valves are more serious.\n【22】 The main causes of heart valve disease are congenital heart disease and other diseases such as rheumatic fever, lupus, cardiomyopathy and endocarditis. Aortic stenosis is the most common type of valve disease and it affects around 1 in 20 adults over the age of 65 years in the UK.\n【23】 Data from the UK heart valve registry indicate that approximately 0.2% of the UK population has prosthetic heart valves. Around 6500 adult heart valve replacements (using mechanical or biological valves) are carried out each year, of which around 5000 are aortic valve replacements.\n【24】 Patients with mechanical heart valves (and some patients with bioprosthetic valves) are susceptible to thromboembolism and need lifelong anticoagulant therapy.\n【25】 # The diagnostic and care pathways\n【26】 Non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists and can be administered to reduce the risk of thrombosis or stroke. The non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have fewer food and drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists and they do not need therapeutic monitoring. However, they may be unsuitable for some people, such as people with mechanical heart valves, certain people with renal or liver dysfunction and those taking concurrent drugs that cannot be taken with the non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. The individual summary of product characteristics should be consulted for specific details when prescribing a non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant. NICE technology appraisal guidance recommends 3 non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants  the NICE guidance on apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate) for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non‑valvular atrial fibrillation.\n【27】 Guidelines on oral anticoagulation with warfarin, published by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology , outline the process for INR monitoring for those receiving warfarin. The NICE clinical knowledge summary for oral anticoagulation states that INR can be most accurately measured in venous blood samples, but that capillary blood samples are  used because they are more convenient. People being tested should receive a written copy of their INR result including any necessary dose adjustments and a date for the next check.\n【28】 The summary states that the INR should be measured:\n【29】 daily, or on alternate days, until it is within the therapeutic range (usually between 2.0 and 3.0, ideally 2. on 2 consecutive occasions\n【30】 then twice weekly for 1–2 weeks, followed by weekly measurements until the INR is stable within the therapeutic range\n【31】 thereafter, depending on the stability of the INR, at longer intervals (for example, up to every 12 weeks, if agreed locally).\n【32】 More frequent monitoring of the INR is recommended for patients at risk of overcoagulation or bleeding, or those having problems adhering to treatment. Intravenous drug users, and people with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV, may be referred to a specialist clinic according to local arrangements.\n【33】 INR monitoring can be managed by local anticoagulant clinics in primary care, but sometimes clinics are based in secondary care, involving travel to hospital. The NICE anticoagulation commissioning guide  states that anticoagulation therapy services can be delivered in a number of different ways, and that mixed models of provision may be needed across a local health region. This could include full service provision in secondary or primary care, shared provision, domiciliary provision and self‑management. Services may be managed by a range of healthcare professionals including nurses, pharmacists and general practitioners.# The diagnostic tests\n【34】 # The interventions\n【35】 ## The CoaguChek XS system\n【36】 The CoaguChek XS system (Roche Diagnostics) comprises a meter and specifically designed test strips that can analyse a blood sample (fresh capillary blood or fresh untreated whole venous blood) and calculate the prothrombin time and the international normalised ratio (INR). These measures indicate the rate at which the blood clots. If the INR is too low, there is a higher risk of blood clots that can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. If the INR is too high, there is a higher risk of bleeding, which in severe cases can be gastrointestinal or intracerebral bleeding.\n【37】 A code chip, which contains calibration data and the expiry date of the test strips, is inserted into the meter before it is switched on. Once the device is switched on, a test strip is inserted and the blood sample is applied. The test result is displayed approximately 1 minute after applying the sample and the monitor automatically stores the result in its memory. The user is guided through the process by on‑screen graphical instructions.\n【38】 The CoaguChek XS test strip contains a lyophilised reagent consisting of thromboplastin and a peptide substrate. When a blood sample is applied, thromboplastin activates coagulation, which leads to the formation of thrombin. The enzyme thrombin cleaves the peptide substrate, generating an electrochemical signal. Depending on the time elapsed before it first appears, this signal is then converted by means of an algorithm into customary coagulation units and the result is displayed on the screen. This can be displayed as prothrombin time in seconds, Quick value, or INR.\n【39】 The CoaguChek XS system has a number of in‑built quality control functions including checks of the electric components when switched on, the test strip temperature during testing, and checks on the test strip batch such as the expiry date and quality of each strip. The CoaguChek XS test strips are packaged as single strips in resealable plastic containers in quantities of 24 and 48 test strips. The strips can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated between 2 and 8°C and can be used straight from the fridge. On manufacture, the CoaguChek XS test strips have a shelf‑life (expiration date) of 18 months.\n【40】 The CoaguChek XS meter is supplied with 4 × AAA batteries, a CoaguChek Softclix finger pricker and 20 Softclix XL lancets, 6 test strips, a user manual and carry case. The system can carry out a minimum of 60 tests per set of batteries. The meter is 138 mm × 78 mm × 28 mm and weighs 127 g (without batteries).\n【41】 An earlier model of the CoaguChek XS system is the CoaguChek S system. The CoaguChek XS system is reported to have the following advantages over the CoaguChek S system: the thromboplastin used in the prothrombin time test strips is a human recombinant thromboplastin, which is more sensitive and has a lower international sensitivity index of 1.0 compared with 1.6; test strips have inbuilt quality control that is automatically run with every test; test strips do not have to be refrigerated; a smaller blood sample can be used; and the meter is smaller and lighter. Another model of the CoaguChek XS system is the CoaguChek XS Plus system. The XS Plus model is intended for use by healthcare professionals only and is not indicated for individual INR self‑monitoring.\n【42】 ## The INRatio2 PT/INR monitor\n【43】 The INRatio2 PT/INR monitor (Alere) does a modified version of the 1‑stage prothrombin time test using a recombinant human thromboplastin reagent. The clot formed in the reaction is detected by the change in the electrical impedance of the sample during the coagulation process. The system consists of a monitor and disposable test strips.\n【44】 The monitor provides a user interface, heats the test strip to the appropriate reaction temperature, measures the impedance of blood samples, and calculates and reports prothrombin time and INR results. Instructions and test results are displayed on an LCD. The monitor can store the results so that past test results can be reviewed.\n【45】 The test strip comprises 2 layers of transparent plastic laminated to each other that contain 1 sample well, 3 clot cells, and narrow channels connecting the sample well and the clot cells. The top side of the bottom layer is printed with 3 pairs of silver electrodes (1 pair per cell) that start from inside the clot cells to the end of the strip where they are connected to the monitor main circuitry. Test strips are individually foil wrapped, supplied in quantities of 12 or 48 strips and can be stored at room temperature for up to 12 months or until the expiration date.\n【46】 The INRatio2 PT/INR monitor analyses fresh capillary blood and when the blood sample is applied to the sample well, it is drawn through the narrow channels by capillary action to the clot cells, where the impedance of the sample is measured by the monitor through the electrodes. Clot cells have reagents applied and the reagents are different for each channel. One channel contains the thromboplastin reagent for the prothrombin time test. The other 2 channels contain reagents that produce a low and high control time, regardless of the clotting time of the sample.\n【47】 Initially, the electrode impedance is infinite but drops to a minimum value when the blood sample fills the clot cells. The time when this initial minimum impedance is achieved is registered by the monitor as the start of the coagulation. As the reaction progresses, the sample impedance increases to a maximum and then gradually drops as the clotting proceeds. The elapsed time, in seconds, from the start until the clotting end point is reached is the prothrombin time. The monitor software calculates the INR of the sample using prothrombin time and calibration coefficients.\n【48】 The INRatio2 PT/INR monitor does a self‑test when it is turned on and each test strip has a code that is accepted by the monitor if the strip code is in the correct format. The monitor uses 4 × AA batteries or a mains adapter as a power source, and can connect to a printer or computer through the RS232 serial communication port.\n【49】 # The comparator: INR testing\n【50】 The comparator used in this assessment is INR testing in primary or secondary care using laboratory analysers or point‑of‑care tests.# Outcomes\n【51】 The Diagnostics Advisory Committee (section  considered evidence from a number of sources (section .\n【52】 # How outcomes were assessed\n【53】 The assessment consisted of a systematic review of the evidence on test performance and clinical‑effectiveness data for the CoaguChek XS system, the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor, the ProTime microcoagulation system and comparator tests. The ProTime microcoagulation system was in the assessment but has been removed from this guidance because it is no longer available to the NHS and its successor model is not intended for patient self‑monitoring.\n【54】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【55】 The External Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of self‑monitoring coagulation status in people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.\n【56】 Studies were included if they appeared relevant to the outcomes listed in the decision problem:\n【57】 Intermediate outcomes:\n【58】 time and values in therapeutic range\n【59】 international normalised ratio (INR) values\n【60】 test failure rate\n【61】 time to test result.\n【62】 Patient adherence to testing and treatment:\n【63】 frequency of testing\n【64】 frequency of visits to primary or secondary care clinics.\n【65】 Clinical outcomes:\n【66】 frequency of bleeds or blood clots\n【67】 morbidity (for example, thromboembolic and cerebrovascular events) and mortality from INR testing and vitamin K antagonist therapy\n【68】 adverse events from INR testing, false test results, vitamin K antagonist therapy and sequelae.\n【69】 Patient‑reported outcomes:\n【70】 anxiety associated with waiting time for results and not knowing current coagulation status and risk\n【71】 acceptability of the tests\n【72】 health‑related quality of life.\n【73】 In total, 26 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in this assessment. The CoaguChek system was used in 22 of the 26 trials: 9 trials used the CoaguChek S model, 4 trials used the CoaguChek XS model, 1 trial used the CoaguChek Plus model, and 2 trials used the CoaguChek model. It was unclear which model of the CoaguChek system was used in 6 of the 22 trials. In 2 of the remaining 4 trials either the CoaguChek S system or the INRatio monitor was used for INR measurement (results were not reported according to the type of point‑of‑care monitor, and the model of the INRatio monitor used in the trials was not reported). No trials that exclusively assessed the clinical effectiveness of the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor were identified. The ProTime microcoagulation system was used in the other 2 trials. In all 6 trials based in the UK, the CoaguChek system (either CoaguChek or version 'S') was used for the INR measurement.\n【74】 The evidence on the clinical effectiveness of the coagulometers for monitoring coagulation status was summarised by the External Assessment Group in 3 categories: intermediate outcomes, clinical outcomes, and patient‑reported outcomes.\n【75】 ## Performance of point‑of‑care coagulometers\n【76】 The External Assessment Group did not carry out a formal evaluation of the performance of the CoaguChek system or the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor with regard to INR measurement because it was outside the scope of this assessment. However, an objective 'true' INR remains to be defined and INR determined in the laboratory is regarded as the gold standard to which all other measurement methods should be compared. Information on the precision and accuracy of these point‑of‑care coagulometers was therefore gathered from the available literature.\n【77】 A systematic review by Christensen and Larsen published in 2012 assessed the precision and accuracy of currently available point‑of‑care coagulometers including CoaguChek XS, INRatio and ProTime. The authors found that the precision of CoaguChek XS varied from a coefficient of variation of 1.4% to 5.9% based on data from 14 studies. The precision of INRatio and ProTime varied from 5.4% to 8.4% based on data from 6 studies. The coefficient of correlation for CoaguChek XS varied from 0.81 to 0.98, and that for INRatio varied from 0.73 to 0.95. The review concluded that the precision and accuracy of point‑of‑care coagulometers were generally acceptable compared with laboratory‑based INR testing. The same conclusions were drawn by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health report published in 2012 on point‑of‑care testing. Similarly, the international guidelines prepared in 2005 by the International Self‑Monitoring Association for Oral Anticoagulation stated that 'Point‑of‑care instruments have been tested in a number of different clinical settings and their accuracy and precision are considered to be more than adequate for the monitoring of oral anticoagulation therapy in both adults and children'.\n【78】 Six studies compared the performance of CoaguChek S with that of CoaguChek XS in relation to conventional INR measurement. The studies showed a good agreement between the 2 CoaguChek models and conventional laboratory‑based testing results. However, the CoaguChek XS showed more accurate and precise results than CoaguChek S in both adults and children, especially for higher INR values (>3..\n【79】 ## Evidence on intermediate outcomes\n【80】 Eighteen trials (including 4 trials that used the CoaguChek XS system) reported INR time in therapeutic range although there was variation in the measures used for reporting this outcome, so pooling the data was not appropriate. Time in therapeutic range ranged from 52% to 80% for self‑monitoring and from 55% to 77% for standard care. In 15 of the 18 trials, time in therapeutic range was higher in self‑monitoring participants compared with those in standard care and, in 5 of these trials (including 2 trials using the CoaguChek XS system), the difference between intervention groups was statistically significant. Three of the UK‑based trials reported no statistically significant differences between self‑monitoring and standard care.\n【81】 Twelve trials reported INR values in therapeutic range and there was variation in the measures used so pooling the data was not appropriate. In 8 of these trials, the proportion of INR values in therapeutic range ranged from 43.2% to 80.8% for self‑monitoring and from 22.3% to 72.0% for standard care. In 4 trials that reported the proportion of participants in therapeutic range, the values ranged from 53.0% to 72.9% for self‑monitoring and from 43.2% to 72.0% for standard care. Ten of the trials reported higher proportions of INR values in therapeutic range or larger proportions of participants in therapeutic range for self‑monitoring than for standard care.\n【82】 Among participants with artificial heart valves, self‑monitoring resulted in a statistically significant higher INR time in therapeutic range compared with standard care. In 2 trials that included participants with atrial fibrillation, no time in therapeutic range differences were found between self‑monitoring and standard care.\n【83】 One trial reported the time for each INR monitoring (that is, time from INR measurement to test results) and the total time spent for anticoagulant management during the 4‑month follow‑up period. The time spent for each INR measurement by self‑managed participants was statistically significantly lower (mean 5.3 minutes, standard deviation  2.6 minutes) compared with the time spent by participants receiving standard care (mean 158 minutes, SD 67.8 minutes, p<0.. During the 4‑month follow‑up, the total time spent for anticoagulation monitoring by participants in standard care was statistically significantly higher (mean 614.9 minutes, SD 308.8 minutes) than the total time spent by participants who self‑managed their therapy (mean 99.6 minutes, SD 46.1 minutes, p<0..\n【84】 One trial reported more than 98% adherence with self‑testing and of those who did not adhere, 2 had difficulties doing the test or experienced disruption caused by hospitalisation, and 1 lost the CoaguChek meter. In another trial 75% (30/ of participants did not report any problems with using the device and expressed willingness to continue with self‑monitoring. The remaining participants who did not adhere to the testing procedure (25%) reported difficulties with the technique or problems placing the fingertip blood drop on the right position on the test strip. This resulted in the need to use multiple strips to achieve a single reading.\n【85】 ## Evidence on clinical outcomes\n【86】 Twenty one trials reported a total of 1472 major and minor bleeding events involving 8394 participants. 476 major bleeding events were reported in a total of 8202 participants and 13 of these 21 trials reported 994 minor bleeding events in a total of 5425 participants. No statistically significant differences were seen between self‑monitoring participants (self‑testing and self‑management) and those in standard care for any bleeding events (relative risk  0.95, 95% confidence interval  0.74 to 1.21, p=0., major bleeding events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22, p=0. and minor bleeding events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34, p=0.. The results were not affected by removing the UK‑based trials or by restricting the included trials to those assessing the CoaguChek system. Similarly, sensitivity analyses restricted to trials using the CoaguChek XS system showed no differences from the all‑trials results. A sensitivity analysis restricted to trials at low risk of bias slightly changed the estimate of effect but did not substantially impact on the findings (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.30, p=0..\n【87】 The External Assessment Group did a subgroup analysis by type of anticoagulant management therapy. No difference between self‑management and standard care for any bleeding events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.30, p=0. was found but there was a statistically significant higher risk in self‑testing participants than in those receiving standard care (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28, p=0.. No statistically significant differences in the risk of major bleeding were seen between self‑management (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.46, p=0. or self‑testing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1. compared with standard care. When only minor bleeding events were assessed, there was a statistically significant increased risk in self‑testing participants (23%) compared with those in standard care (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.42, p=0. but not in those who were self‑managing (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35, p=0..\n【88】 Of the 21 trials, 2 trials enrolled participants with atrial fibrillation, 6 trials enrolled participants with artificial heart valves and 13 trials enrolled participants with mixed indication. No statistically significant subgroup differences were found for bleeding events according to the type of clinical indication or the type of control standard care.\n【89】 Twenty one trials reported 351 major and minor thromboembolic events in a total of 8394 participants. Self‑monitoring (self‑testing and self‑management) showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of thromboembolic events by 42% (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84, p=0. compared with standard care. The risk reduction further increased to 48% when only major thromboembolic events were considered (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.80, p=0.. The risk of thromboembolic events substantially decreased when the analyses were restricted to non‑UK trials (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32, 0.76, p=0.; to CoaguChek trials (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38, 0.71, p<0.; and to trials at low risk of bias (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92, p=0..\n【90】 Self‑management halved the risk of thromboembolic events compared with standard care (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.69, p<0.. In contrast, there was no statistically significant risk reduction for self‑testing compared with standard care (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31, p=0.. The subgroup difference between self‑management and self‑testing was statistically significant (p=0.. Self‑monitoring participants with artificial heart valves showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of thromboembolic events compared with those in standard care (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.82, p=0.. No statistically significant effect was shown among self‑monitoring participants with mixed clinical indication (atrial fibrillation, artificial heart valves, or other conditions) compared with participants receiving standard care.\n【91】 Thirteen trials reported 422 deaths due to all‑cause mortality in a total of 6537 participants. The risk reduction for all‑cause mortality was not statistically significant between self‑monitoring (self‑testing and self‑management) and standard care (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.10, p=0..\n【92】 Risk of death reduced by 32% through self‑management (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01, p=0. but not through self‑testing (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19, p=0. even though the test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (p=0.. Self‑monitoring halved the risk of mortality in participants with artificial heart valves (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92, p=0. but not in those with mixed clinical indication for anticoagulant therapy (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16, p=0.. The subgroup difference between participants with artificial heart valves and those with mixed indication with regard to the number of deaths was statistically significant (p=0.. No data were available from trials that enrolled participants with atrial fibrillation. Statistically significantly fewer deaths were recorded among participants who self‑monitored their therapy compared with those who were routinely managed by their GP/doctor (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.90, p=0..\n【93】 ## Evidence on patient‑reported outcomes\n【94】 One trial (n= compared self‑management with self‑testing in children and reported that 1 parent did not favour self‑management because of the increased anxiety about INR measurements.\n【95】 Four trials conducted a questionnaire survey to assess acceptability to participants of self‑testing and self‑management using point‑of‑care devices. These trials reported high rates of acceptance for both self‑management and self‑testing (77% to 98%).\n【96】 One of these trials reported that 93% of participants rated their satisfaction with regard to self‑monitoring (using either the INRatio monitor or the CoaguChek S system) as high or good. When asked about the overall relative satisfaction with the device, 43% of participants favoured the INRatio monitor, 36% the CoaguChek S system, and 21% both devices in equal way. One trial conducted in children reported that most participants (13 out of 14 participating families, 92%) opted for the CoaguChek XS device.\n【97】 An unpublished review from the National Thrombosis Service in the Netherlands reported the INR values from over 5000 patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy using either the CoaguChek XS system or the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor for self‑monitoring. The review reported that the INR values within therapeutic range were comparable between the monitors. It  reported that the choice of monitor appeared to have no clinically relevant effect on the time in therapeutic range or adverse outcomes in people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n【98】 # Health‑related quality of life\n【99】 Health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported in 9 trials using a variety of different measures. Four trials used Sawicki's questionnaire to measure quality of life, and substantially greater improvements in treatment satisfaction and self‑efficacy were reported in the self‑management arm compared with the standard care arm of the trials. All 4 trials reported a reduced level of distress and daily inconvenience although 1 trial reported an increased level of distress in participants who received education but did not directly monitor their anticoagulation therapy.\n【100】 Two UK‑based trials reported no substantial differences in quality‑of‑life outcomes between self‑monitoring participants and those receiving standard care. One trial reported quality‑of‑life data using the UK SF‑36, the EuroQol scores and Lancaster's instrument. The other trial assessed themes that were adapted from the Lancaster tool, the SEIQol tool and a series of focus groups. Five common themes emerged from the interviews on self‑management: knowledge and management of condition and self‑empowerment, increased anxiety and obsession with health, self‑efficacy, relationship with healthcare professionals, and societal and economic cost. One trial, conducted in the Netherlands, measured quality of life in people with artificial heart valves by using the SF‑36v2. Substantial improvements in quality‑of‑life scores in the physical component summary were reported in people who self‑managed their therapy compared with those receiving standard care.\n【101】 Another trial measured quality of life by means of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. It reported a statistically significant gain in health utilities at the 2‑year follow‑up among self‑testing participants compared with those managed in high quality anticoagulant clinics (p<0.. The same investigators  measured anticoagulant satisfaction using Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale. They found that the degree of satisfaction was higher in self‑testing participants compared with those in standard care (p=0..\n【102】 One trial compared self‑management with self‑testing in children and provided quality‑of‑life data using the KIDCLOT PAC QL parent‑proxy (parents' quality of life and their assessment of child's quality of life) and the child teen KIDCLOT PAC QL. The 5 common themes identified were: awareness, communication, relationship between parent and child, flexibility and anxiety.\n【103】 # Costs and cost effectiveness\n【104】 The External Assessment Group conducted a systematic review to identify existing economic analyses for self‑monitoring coagulation status. The review  sought to identify potentially relevant evidence sources to inform parameter values for the de novo economic model developed by the External Assessment Group. The de novo economic model constructed aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring coagulation status using the CoaguChek XS system, the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor or the ProTime microcoagulation system. The ProTime microcoagulation system was included in the assessment but has been removed from this guidance because it is no longer available to the NHS and its successor model is not intended for patient self‑monitoring.\n【105】 ## Systematic review of cost‑effectiveness evidence\n【106】 The systematic review identified 12 relevant economic evaluations. All of these evaluations compared INR self‑monitoring strategies with standard care and were assessed against the NICE reference case by the External Assessment Group. The results of the studies included in the systematic review varied widely and showed that the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring was dependent on a number of key factors.\n【107】 The adopted perspective and the initial costs associated with self‑monitoring appeared to substantially affect the cost effectiveness. Self‑monitoring strategies appeared more favourable than standard care when a wider societal perspective was adopted, as a result of lower time costs associated with fewer health service contacts. The size of the estimates of effect applied to self‑monitoring in reducing thromboembolic and bleeding events compared with those applied to standard care  appeared to affect cost effectiveness. The 2 UK‑based evaluations applied effect estimates consistent with small or negligible differences between self‑management and usual care with respect to time in therapeutic range and adverse thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events. This resulted in a low probability of self‑monitoring being cost effective. Several studies that applied large effect estimates resulted in a high probability of self‑monitoring being cost effective.\n【108】 The 2 UK‑based economic evaluations were based on data from the same trial. One evaluation adopted an NHS and wider societal perspective, and the other adopted an NHS and personal social services perspective. Self‑monitoring strategies appeared to increase the costs of INR monitoring in the short term and because these 2 evaluations applied small effect estimates, consistent with those seen in the largest UK‑based trial of patient self‑management, self‑monitoring of INR appeared unlikely to be cost effective. However, no UK‑based trials have been sufficiently powered to detect a statistically significant difference between standard INR monitoring and patient self‑monitoring in terms of major thromboembolic or haemorrhagic events. Therefore, the External Assessment Group carried out a meta‑analysis of relevant trials including evidence from a number of European trials in which standard care is similar to that provided in the UK in terms of approach, frequency of testing and the level of INR control achieved.\n【109】 ## Economic analysis\n【110】 The External Assessment Group developed a de novo economic model designed to assess the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring (self‑managing and self‑testing) coagulation status using 2 different point‑of‑care coagulometers: the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor.\n【111】 ## Model structure\n【112】 The structure of the Markov model was based on the review of published models of INR self‑monitoring and previous models evaluating the cost effectiveness of new anticoagulant drugs compared with warfarin therapy in people with atrial fibrillation. A further unpublished economic model of INR self‑monitoring was provided by the manufacturer of CoaguChek XS, and this model was  used to inform the structure of the new economic model.\n【113】 The Markov model compared the alternative monitoring strategies for a hypothetical cohort of people with atrial fibrillation or an artificial heart valve, and was used to simulate the occurrence of thromboembolic and bleeding events over a 10‑year period. People with atrial fibrillation or an artificial heart valve represent the majority of people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy. The model simulated transitions between the discrete health states, and accumulated costs and quality‑adjusted life years (QALYs) on a quarterly (3 month) cycle. Within each cycle, the simulated cohort was exposed to a risk of the adverse events as well as death from other causes. The adverse events included in the model were ischaemic stroke (minor, non‑disabling, and major, disabling or fatal), systemic embolism, minor haemorrhage, and major haemorrhage (intra‑cranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal bleed, and others). A constraint was applied whereby the simulated cohort in the model could only experience 1 event per cycle.\n【114】 ## Model inputs\n【115】 The model was populated using data derived from the systematic clinical effectiveness review, other additional focused reviews to inform key parameters (for instance baseline risks), routine sources of cost data, and where necessary some study‑specific cost estimates based on expert opinion.\n【116】 ## Costs\n【117】 Data on the resource use and costs associated with the alternative monitoring strategies were informed by published literature, existing guidance, expert opinion, manufacturers' and suppliers' prices, and other routine sources of unit cost data. Some costs were informed by expert opinion where suitable data from other sources were not available.\n【118】 ## Health‑related quality of life\n【119】 The baseline utility value for people with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valve who were stable was taken as the baseline EQ‑5D value from trial data, 0.738. This value was applied to 65–70 year old people and adjusted by the External Assessment Group to estimate age‑specific baseline utilities in the model.\n【120】 Utilities associated with acute events were applied for the 3‑month period after the event. For post‑event states with associated ongoing morbidity, the appropriate health state utilities were applied for all subsequent cycles spent in these states. Half‑cycle corrections were applied, by assuming that people experienced events on average at the mid‑point of the cycle. Thus a patient starting off in the well state and experiencing a major stroke in a given cycle of the model would accrue 6 weeks at the utility value for well and 6 weeks at the utility value for major stroke.\n【121】 ## Base‑case analysis\n【122】 For the purposes of decision‑making, the incremental cost‑effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per QALY gained were considered. The following assumptions were applied in the base‑case analysis:\n【123】 % of standard care monitoring was done in primary care by practice nurses.\n【124】 % of the cohort had atrial fibrillation and 40% had an artificial heart valve.\n【125】 The average age of the cohort was 65 years, and 55% were male.\n【126】 % of people who self‑monitored did self‑testing and 50% self‑managed.\n【127】 The increase in the number of tests done per year with self‑monitoring was 23 (that is, 35 tests compared with 12 tests in standard care).\n【128】 Relative treatment effects were estimated and applied separately for self‑testing and self‑management.\n【129】 % of participants did not start self‑monitoring after training (training failure).\n【130】 % of participants stopped self‑monitoring within a year of starting.\n【131】 Self‑monitoring device costs were annuitized over 5 years.\n【132】 % of devices were reused by another patient when a patient stopped self‑monitoring.\n【133】 The results indicated that over a 10‑year period, introducing self‑monitoring would reduce the proportion of people experiencing a thromboembolic event by 2.5%, while slightly increasing the proportion having a major haemorrhagic event by 1.4%.\n【134】 The predicted monitoring costs were higher with self‑monitoring compared with standard monitoring, but the total health and social care costs were similar and in some cases lower. The QALY gains were greater for self‑monitoring than standard monitoring. For all of the self‑monitoring coagulometers there was a QALY gain of 0.027 compared with standard monitoring. Self‑monitoring with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor was £29 cheaper than standard monitoring. Self‑monitoring with the CoaguChek XS system was £37 more expensive than standard monitoring. Therefore, in the base‑case scenario, the self‑monitoring strategies compared favourably with standard care. The INRatio2 PT/INR monitor dominated standard monitoring in the analysis because it was less costly and more effective. The ICER for the CoaguChek XS system was £319 per QALY gained compared with standard monitoring. The lower cost of the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor and testing strips, coupled with the assumption of equivalent clinical effectiveness, meant that the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor  dominated the CoaguChek XS system. However, it should be noted that no direct evidence of clinical effectiveness was identified exclusively for the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor from the systematic review.\n【135】 ## Analysis of alternative scenarios\n【136】 Several scenario analyses were done by the External Assessment Group:\n【137】 exclusive self‑testing or self‑management compared with standard monitoring in primary and secondary care\n【138】 exclusive primary or secondary care clinic testing compared with self‑monitoring in primary and secondary care\n【139】 different pooled risk estimates applied.\n【140】 For the exclusive self‑management strategy, the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor and the CoaguChek XS system dominated standard monitoring under the base‑case assumptions, whereas for the exclusive self‑testing strategy, the ICERs were above £2 million per QALY gained compared with standard monitoring. The results  showed that for a mixed self‑monitoring strategy (50% self‑testing, 50% self‑management), the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor dominated standard monitoring when exclusively carried out in secondary care. When applying the pooled relative risk estimates for adverse events (derived from all self‑monitoring studies) to both self‑testing and self‑managing participants, the cost savings and QALY gains associated with self‑monitoring increased.\n【141】 The External Assessment Group carried out alternative non‑base‑case scenarios, to assess the impact of using self‑monitoring to replace standard monitoring tests (that is, no increase in the number of tests done annually). It was assumed that there was no difference in clinical effectiveness between self‑management, self‑testing and standard care. Under most of these scenarios, standard monitoring was found to be less costly than self‑monitoring. However, self‑testing and self‑management with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor and the CoaguChek XS system dominated standard monitoring when carried out exclusively in secondary care.\n【142】 Subgroup analyses showed the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring compared with standard care, stratified by indication (atrial fibrillation and artificial heart valves) and cohort age. Self‑monitoring in a '65 years old with atrial fibrillation' cohort was estimated to cost £2574 per QALY gained when using the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor and £4160 per QALY gained when using the CoaguChek XS system, compared with standard monitoring. For a '65 years old with artificial heart valve' cohort, self‑monitoring with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor and the CoaguChek XS system was found to be more effective and less costly (dominant) compared with standard monitoring.\n【143】 A further analysis was carried out for the atrial fibrillation cohort using the baseline risks seen for participants with better INR control in standard care, assuming a constant relative risk reduction for thromboembolic events associated with self‑monitoring. As the INR time in therapeutic range increased in the control group, and the baseline risk of thromboembolic events consequently dropped, the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring  decreased. However, the ICERs for the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor only rose above £20,000 per QALY gained when the baseline time in therapeutic range was set at greater than 72.6%.\n【144】 ## Sensitivity analyses\n【145】 Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the model‑based findings were most sensitive to the baseline risk of thromboembolic events and the effectiveness of self‑monitoring for preventing these events. The ICERs for the self‑monitoring strategies rose above £30,000 per QALY gained when the baseline risk was set to 1.15% and the upper confidence limit for the relative risk of thromboembolic events associated with self‑management (RR 0. was applied. The same was found when the lower baseline risk of thromboembolic events was coupled with the upper confidence limit of the pooled relative risk for self‑monitoring (RR 0.. It should be noted however that self‑management on its own remained cost saving under the former combined scenario.\n【146】 A sensitivity analysis was  conducted to approximate the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring for a cohort of children with an artificial heart valve on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy. For this analysis, the cohort age was set to 10, the baseline risk of thromboembolic events was reduced to 1.4%, and the standardised mortality ratio for all‑cause mortality after a stroke was set at 14.5. Under this scenario, self‑monitoring with the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor dominated standard monitoring. However, it should be noted that the standardised mortality ratio estimated for an 18–55 year old cohort of people with artificial heart valves was applied because no robust data were identified to appropriately adjust the risk of death from all causes in children with an artificial heart valve.\n【147】 Probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the base case were done to examine the uncertainty in the cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring. Self‑monitoring with the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor were estimated to have an 80% and 81% probability of being cost effective if the maximum acceptable ICER was £20,000 per QALY gained, respectively. However, it should be noted that there is no direct randomised controlled trial evidence to show the clinical effectiveness of the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor.# Considerations\n【148】 The Diagnostics Advisory Committee reviewed the evidence available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of self‑monitoring coagulometers for self‑testing or self‑managing coagulation status in people on long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.\n【149】 The Committee considered the clinical evidence on the use of point‑of‑care coagulometers in people with atrial fibrillation or artificial heart valves. The Committee noted that 26 randomised controlled trials compared the use of point‑of‑care coagulometers for self‑monitoring with standard anticoagulation control. The Committee noted that self‑monitoring nearly halved the risk of thromboembolic events and substantially reduced the risk of mortality in people with artificial heart valves compared with standard monitoring. However, the Committee  noted that self‑monitoring did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the number of major and minor bleeding events compared with standard monitoring. The Committee discussed the heterogeneity in the trials and the applicability of the pooled results from the meta‑analysis of the trial data to the UK population. It noted that the meta‑analysis results showed low statistical heterogeneity and concluded that self‑monitoring offered clinical benefit because it was likely to result in a significant reduction in thromboembolic events. The Committee concluded that the pooled effect estimates from the meta‑analysis were likely to be applicable to the UK because there are no confounding biological differences between people receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy in the UK and those in other countries.\n【150】 The Committee discussed that 22 of the 26 trials included in the assessment investigated the use of the CoaguChek system and considered the different versions of the CoaguChek systems used in these trials. The Committee noted that there are substantial technical differences between the CoaguChek S system and the CoaguChek XS system and heard from clinical specialists and the manufacturer that changes had been made to the different versions to improve reliability and accuracy. The Committee considered the performance of the CoaguChek S and XS systems compared with the gold standard of laboratory‑based INR testing and noted that the precision and accuracy of the 2 CoaguChek versions correlated with that of laboratory‑based measurements. The Committee concluded that results from the CoaguChek XS system were likely to be at least as good as those obtained from trials in which previous versions of the system were used. The Committee  noted that 4 of the 22 trials investigated the use of the CoaguChek XS system and that 2 of these trials demonstrated a significant improvement in time in therapeutic range. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to pool the results of trials using different versions of the CoaguChek system and that these pooled results could demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of self‑monitoring using the CoaguChek XS version of the system.\n【151】 The Committee considered the evidence for the 2 different self‑monitoring coagulometers: the CoaguChek XS system and the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor. The Committee noted that 22 of the 26 trials included in the assessment investigated the use of the CoaguChek system and noted that there was no direct randomised controlled trial evidence to show the clinical effectiveness of the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor. The Committee considered the evidence that showed the 2 coagulometers had a broadly similar performance in precision and accuracy with regard to time in therapeutic range measurement when compared with the gold standard of laboratory‑based INR testing and therefore concluded that it was appropriate to extrapolate the clinical‑effectiveness data from the CoaguChek system to the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor.\n【152】 The Committee discussed the usability of the coagulometers and noted that small differences in devices can sometimes result in large differences in behaviour. The Committee considered the results of the systematic review by Christensen and Larsen  and the unpublished review of over 5000 patients from the National Thrombosis Service in the Netherlands. It noted that although the results of the unpublished review suggested that any potential differences in usability between the 2 monitors did not affect their clinical effectiveness, the unpublished review could not be considered methodologically robust. The Committee concluded that based on the systematic review, any potential differences in the usability of the coagulometers did not appear to affect their ability to measure INR.\n【153】 The Committee considered the differences in clinical outcomes between people who were self‑managing their anticoagulation control and those who were self‑testing. The Committee noted that there was a statistically significantly greater reduction in thromboembolic events among people who self‑managed compared with those who self‑tested. The Committee  noted that when only minor bleeding events were assessed, a statistically significantly increased risk was seen in self‑testing participants compared with those in standard care. All‑cause mortality was lower through self‑management but not through self‑testing. The Committee discussed possible reasons for the differences in results between self‑managing and self‑testing, and it heard from clinical specialists that people who self‑manage their coagulation control may behave differently to those who self‑test because they have greater responsibility for managing their coagulation control. The Committee noted that the largest trial in the assessment of self‑testing did not show a reduction in clinical adverse events but did show an increase in the time in therapeutic range . The Committee  noted that this trial had a high standard of coagulation control in the control arm, which could explain why no statistically significant difference in clinical adverse events was detected between the self‑testing group and the standard care group. The Committee concluded that the high standard of coagulation control in the control arm of the trial may not reflect general UK clinical practice and so it was plausible that the increase in time in therapeutic range would lead to a statistically significant reduction in clinical adverse events if compared with UK standard coagulation control practice. The Committee concluded that self‑testing and self‑managing were likely to be clinically effective and that self‑testing was often a step towards self‑management in clinical practice.\n【154】 The Committee considered the clinical evidence for using self‑monitoring in the population group with atrial fibrillation. The Committee noted that only 2 trials investigated self‑monitoring in people with atrial fibrillation and 19 trials investigated self‑monitoring in a mixed population that included people with atrial fibrillation. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that the clinical outcomes for people with atrial fibrillation are similar to those for people with artificial heart valves. The Committee  heard that people with artificial heart valves may be a younger population than people with atrial fibrillation. The Committee noted that it was not possible to isolate the data for people with atrial fibrillation from the mixed populations investigated in the 19 trials but concluded that it was likely that self‑monitoring would result in similar clinical benefits in people with atrial fibrillation to those achieved in people with artificial heart valves.\n【155】 The Committee considered the cost‑effectiveness analysis carried out by the External Assessment Group on self‑monitoring. In the base‑case analysis, self‑monitoring with the CoaguChek XS system resulted in an incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) of around £300 per quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained (based on the pooled effect estimates from the meta‑analysis) compared with standard monitoring. Self‑monitoring with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor dominated (that is, was less expensive and more effective than) the CoaguChek XS system and standard care, although the Committee noted that there was no direct randomised controlled trial evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor so clinical effectiveness equivalent to the CoaguChek XS system was assumed in the base case. The Committee concluded that self‑monitoring with the CoaguChek XS system is cost effective in light of the reduction in thromboembolic events seen in the pooled results of the trial data. However, although the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor dominated standard monitoring in the base‑case analysis, the Committee did not consider this result to be as robust as that for the CoaguChek XS system because there was no direct evidence of clinical effectiveness for the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor that showed a reduction in thromboembolic events. The Committee noted the similar performance of the CoaguChek XS system and the InRatio2 PT/INR monitor compared with the gold standard of laboratory‑based INR testing and concluded therefore that self‑monitoring with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitor was likely to represent a cost‑effective use of NHS resources.\n【156】 The Committee considered the cost effectiveness of self‑testing and self‑managing individually. The findings showed that self‑management alone is highly cost effective (dominant) but that self‑testing alone is not cost effective, compared with standard monitoring. The Committee noted that these findings were based on the contrasting pooled‑effect estimates obtained from the meta‑analysis of randomised controlled trials, based on thromboembolic events while self‑testing and self‑managing. The Committee discussed the impact of 1 large trial by Matchar   section 6. on the cost effectiveness of self‑testing and noted that although this trial did not show a reduction in clinical adverse events, it did show an increase in the time in therapeutic range. The Committee discussed the impact on the ICERs for self‑testing if the economic model was driven by time in therapeutic range rather than adverse events. The Committee concluded that self‑testing may be more cost effective if the model had been based on time in therapeutic range. The Committee  considered the costs of self‑managing and self‑testing and noted that self‑testing was more expensive because of higher administration costs. The Committee heard from the External Assessment Group that if the pooled‑effect estimates from self‑monitoring were applied to self‑testing, self‑testing would become cost effective even with the higher administration costs this incurred. The Committee concluded that it was likely that the increase in time in therapeutic range shown for self‑testing in the trial would lead to a reduction in adverse events compared with standard clinical practice in the UK. The Committee therefore concluded that it was likely that the clinical benefits of self‑testing had been underestimated in the economic analyses and that both self‑testing and self‑managing were cost effective.\n【157】 The Committee considered the impact on people whose anticoagulation therapy is monitored by standard clinical practice. The Committee acknowledged the additional costs and inconvenience for patients of travelling to specialist clinics or hospital to be monitored. The Committee  noted the loss in productivity through absence from work or school to attend clinic appointments. The Committee acknowledged these costs were incurred outside the healthcare system and therefore not included in the reference case; however, it considered that self‑monitoring may reduce the costs and inconvenience incurred by the patient. The Committee  noted that monitoring anticoagulation therapy can have a substantial impact on the quality of life of patients and their families because of the anxiety associated with the risks of bleeding and the consequent behavioural changes such as the length of time they are willing to spend away from home or the distances they are willing to travel. The Committee concluded that the main benefits of self‑monitoring involve reducing the substantial burden associated with monitoring anticoagulation therapy for the patient and their families.\n【158】 The Committee considered the different methods of self‑monitoring for people having long‑term vitamin K antagonist therapy. The Committee heard from a clinical specialist that computer algorithms may be used by some services to determine dose adjustments. The Committee noted that the cost of software licensing had not been included in the cost‑effectiveness analyses and it discussed the implications of computer‑based dosing for people who would self‑manage their coagulation status. The Committee heard that there were alternative methods to determine dose adjustments and that a lack of internet access should not restrict a person's access to self‑monitoring. The Committee considered an additional analysis by the External Assessment Group that investigated the impact of an additional cost for dose adjustment software on the base‑case ICERs for self‑managing. The Committee noted that the additional cost of software would need to be greater than £190 per patient per year to substantially affect the cost‑effectiveness of self‑managing with the coagulometers. The Committee concluded that the additional cost of software was unlikely to exceed this value and therefore, even with this potential additional cost, self‑managing with the point‑of‑care coagulometers would still represent a cost‑effective use of resources in the NHS.\n【159】 The Committee considered the benefits for patients receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy of using point‑of‑care coagulometers. It heard from a patient expert on the Committee that self‑monitoring is important to psychological wellbeing because it provides a sense of control for the patient and removes the need to frequently attend clinics or hospitals, which serve as a constant reminder of their condition. The Committee  heard that self‑monitoring allows people to travel to visit, or act as a carer for, other family members, without having to worry about attending testing appointments or if testing facilities are available in other countries. The Committee  heard that the current variation in access to self‑testing strips on prescription for self‑monitoring was of concern to patients because it restricted their freedom to move GP practice or move house to a different area in case the testing strips would no longer be prescribed. The Committee concluded that the benefits of self‑monitoring for patients were not fully captured in the cost‑effectiveness analyses.\n【160】 The Committee considered the similarities between self‑monitoring coagulation status and self‑managing diabetes. The Committee heard from a patient expert that some patients are used to self‑testing for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart conditions. The Committee  heard from a clinical specialist that although there were similarities between self‑testing for different conditions, there were intrinsic differences between self‑testing for diabetes and coagulation. Vitamin K antagonists are more sensitive to diet and exercise, and act over a longer period of time than insulin. Therefore, the dose response for vitamin K antagonists is less predictable than for insulin and the risk of adverse events is perceived to be higher. The clinical specialist  reported that some patients were successfully self‑monitoring their coagulation status but not all people receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy will be able to self‑monitor and some may not wish to. The Committee noted that some groups of patients who may have difficulty with self‑monitoring, such as children or those with a disability, may be able to self‑test or self‑manage with the help of a carer. The Committee concluded that there are different considerations for self‑monitoring of coagulation status to those made for self‑testing for diabetes, and that the decision for a patient to self‑monitor should be made after a thorough discussion and subsequent agreement between the patient and the healthcare professional.\n【161】 The Committee considered the impact of the increasing use of non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drugs, which do not involve monitoring because of their predictable dose response. It heard from clinical specialists that there are factors that may influence clinical decisions and affect the number of people receiving warfarin: people receiving warfarin who have stable INRs may be unlikely to switch to non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and the non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants may be unsuitable for some, such as people with mechanical heart valves, certain people with renal or liver dysfunction or those taking drugs that cannot be taken at the same time as the non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. The Committee concluded that, because the non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants would not be suitable for all people who need anticoagulant therapy, and there are many people who will receive warfarin therapy rather than non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy, self‑monitoring coagulometers are still of clinical importance to the NHS and patients.\n【162】 The Committee considered the need for quality control of individual patient coagulometers. The Committee heard from a clinical specialist that the National External Quality Assessment Service runs a scheme to ensure the accuracy of coagulometers used by healthcare professionals, and coagulometers used by patients could be checked against a professional coagulometer to ensure accuracy. The Committee concluded that this was a reliable method of ensuring accuracy of individual coagulometers.\n", "seq_id": 1938, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#10#10#最后一句另起一行\n缺少换行#33#33#最后一句另起一行\n缺少换行#50#50#最后一句另起一行", "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#129#129#首句%没表述完整\n语义不完整#130#130#首句%没表述完整\n语义不完整\n#132#132#首句%没表述完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 00:15:21"}

In general, pumpkins have stems which are firmer, ridgid, pricker, have +/- a 5 degree angle, and squarer in shape than squash stems which are generally softer, more rounded, and more flared where joined to the fruit.\n【4】 Pumpkins generally weigh 9–18 lbs (4–8 kg) with the largest (of the species c. maxima) capable of reaching over 75 lbs (34 kg) . The pumpkin varies greatly in shape, ranging from oblate through oblong. The rind is smooth and usually lightly ribbed .\n【5】 Although pumpkins are usually orange or yellow  , some fruits are dark green, pale green, orange-yellow, white, red and gray.\n【6】 Pumpkins are angiosperms, having both male and female flowers, the latter distinguished by the small ovary at the base of the petals.\n【7】 These bright and colorful flowers have extremely short life spans, and may only open for as short a time as one day. Their orange color is due to containing massive amounts of lutein, alpha- and beta-carotene. These nutrients turn to vitamin A in the body.\n【8】 # Taxonomy\n【9】 Pumpkin is a fruit of the species Cucurbita pepo or Cucurbita mixta.  It can refer to a specific variety of the species Cucurbita maxima or Cucurbita moschata, which are all of the genus Cucurbita and the family Cucurbitaceae.\n【10】 In Korea and Japan, the word translating to \"pumpkin\" is a slang term for an unattractive woman. In the American South and Midwest, however, the term \"pumpkin\" is sometimes used as an endearment.\n【11】 # Distribution and Habitation\n【12】 Although native to the Western hemisphere, pumpkins are cultivated in North America, continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and some other countries. The pumpkin is the state fruit of New Hampshire.\n【13】 # Ecology\n【14】 ## Cultivation in the US\n【15】 Pumpkins have historically been pollinated by the native squash bee Peponapis pruinosa, but this bee has declined, probably due to pesticide sensitivity, and today most commercial plantings are pollinated by honeybees. One hive per acre  Department of Agriculture.  If there are inadequate bees for pollination, gardeners often have to hand pollinate. Inadequately pollinated pumpkins usually start growing but abort before full development. An opportunistic fungus is  sometimes blamed for abortions.\n【16】 ## Giant Pumpkins\n【17】 Pumpkins are capable of growing extremely large with the proper attention and care. The world record pumpkin weighs 1689 lbs . The 2007 record pumpkin was grown in Rhode Island and weighed at the  Topsfield Fair GPC in Topsfield, Massachusetts . The growth of enormous pumpkins being cultivated by hybridizing their seeds.\n【18】 The largest pumpkins are Cucurbita maxima.  They were culminated from the hubbard squash genotype, crossed with kabocha-pumpkin types by enthusiast farmers through intermittent effort since the early 1800s.  As such germplasm is commercially provocative, a U.S. legal right was granted for the rounder phenotypes, levying them as constituting a variety, with the appellation \"Atlantic Giant.\"  Processually this phenotype graduated back into the public domain, except now it had the name Atlantic Giant on its record  USDA PVP # .\n【19】 # Uses\n【20】 ## Cooking\n【21】 When ripe, the pumpkin is very versatile. It can be boiled, baked, or roasted. Often, it is made into various kinds of pie which is a traditional staple of the Canadian and American Thanksgiving holiday. Pumpkins that are still small and green may be eaten in the same way as the vegetable marrow/zucchini. Pumpkins can  be eaten mashed or incorporated into soup. If milk is poured into a pumpkin and then the pumpkin is baked, it can be made into a pudding. In the Middle East, pumpkin is used for sweet dishes; a well-known sweet delicacy is called halawa yaqtin. In South Asian countries like India, pumpkin is cooked with butter, sugar, and spices; this dish is called kadu ka halwa. In Australia, pumpkin is often roasted in conjunction with other vegetables. In Japan, small pumpkins are served in savory dishes, including tempura. In Thailand, small pumpkins are steamed with custard inside and served as a dessert. Finally, pumpkin can be used to flavor both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.\n【22】 ## Pumpkin seeds\n【23】 The hulled or semi-hulled seeds of pumpkins can be roasted and eaten as a snack, similar to the sunflower seed. Pumpkin seeds can be prepared for eating by first separating them from the orange pumpkin flesh, then coating them in a generally salty sauce (Worcestershire sauce, for example), after which the seeds are distributed upon a baking sheet, and then cooked in an oven at a relatively low temperature for a long period of time.\n【24】 Pumpkin seeds are a good source of iron, zinc, essential fatty acids, potassium, and magnesium. Pumpkin seeds may  promote prostate health since components in pumpkin seed oil appear to interrupt the triggering of prostate cell multiplication by testosterone and DHT. Removing the white hull of the pumpkin seed reveals an edible, green-colored seed inside that is commonly referred to as a pepita in North and South America.\n【25】 One gram of pumpkin seed protein contains as much tryptophan as a full glass of milk . Multiplying the number of fruiting sections in a field pumpkin (C. pepo variety) by 16 gives roughly the number of seeds in the pumpkin (give or take 10 or so). Guessing the number of seeds in the pumpkin is a game sometimes played by children.\n【26】 Austria is a well-known producer of pumpkin seed oil.\n【27】 # Activities involving pumpkins\n【28】 ## Halloween\n【29】 Using pumpkins as lanterns during Halloween is based on an ancient Celtic custom brought to America by Irish immigrants. All Hallows Even was celebrated on 31 October and marked the New Year of the Celtic calendar year and the Festival of Samhain. On that night hollowed-out turnips, beets and rutabagas with candles inside them were placed on windowsills and porches to welcome home the spirits of deceased ancestors and ward off evil spirits and a restless soul called \"Stingy Jack,\" hence the name \"Jack-o-lantern\".\n【30】 On Halloween night, Linus Van Pelt of the comic strip Peanuts waits in a pumpkin patch for \"the Great Pumpkin\", a fictional pumpkin which had many of Santa Claus's characteristics. It seems, however, to exist only in his imagination.\n【31】 ## Chucking\n【32】 Pumpkin chucking is a competitive activity in which teams build various mechanical devices designed to throw a pumpkin as far as possible. Catapults, trebuchets, ballistas and air cannons are the most common mechanisms. Some pumpkin chuckers breed and grow special varieties of pumpkin under specialized conditions in order to improve the pumpkin's chances of surviving a throw.\n【33】 ## Pumpkin festivals and competitions\n【34】 Pumpkin growers often compete to see whose pumpkins are the most massive. Festivals are often dedicated to the pumpkin and these competitions.\n【35】 Circleville, Ohio, holds a big festival each year, the Circleville Pumpkin Show.  Half Moon Bay, California, holds the annual Pumpkin and Arts Festival, drawing over 250,000 visitors each year and including the World Champion Pumpkin Weigh-Off.  Farmers from all over the west compete to determine who can grow the greatest gourd . The winning pumpkin regularly tops the scale at more than 1200 pounds. (The world record pumpkin in 2007 was grown by Joe Jutras in Topsfield, Massachusetts.) Morton, Illinois, the self-declared pumpkin capital of the world, has held a Pumpkin Festival since 1966. The town, where Nestlé's pumpkin packing plant is located (and where 90% of canned pumpkins eaten in the US are processed) carved and lit pumpkins in one place, a record which the town held for several years before losing it to Boston, Massachusetts in 2006. A large contributor of pumpkins to the festival is local Keene State College which hosts an event called \"Pumpkin Lobotomy\" on their main quad. Usually held the day before the festival itself, Pumpkin Lobotomy has the air of a large party, with the school providing pumpkins and carving instruments alike (though some students prefer to use their own) and music provided by college radio station, WKNH.\n", "seq_id": 32319, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:15:25"}

The carpometacarpal joint is usually found at the base of the second and third metacarpal bones at the point where they meet the small bones of the wrist. This condition can result in sensitivity in the immediate area and/or an unsightly bulge on the back of the hand.  In most cases, the boss does not result in any injury or further problems, but in some cases, the patient may feel pain, aching, or even possibly a slight lack of mobility in the wrist joint. Often, this condition will be mistaken for a ganglion cyst due to its location and external appearance.\n【3】 A carpometacarpal boss may exist from birth or may be the result of a trauma or injury in the affected area.

In 1932, Holzmann and Scherf suggested that ventricular pre-excitation was possible through these muscular connections.  Later, Wood and his colleagues and subsequently Ohnell described the first anatomical pathways for these accessory atrioventricular connections.\n【6】 # Pathophysiology\n【7】 Bundle of Kent is an abnormal pathway present in a small percentage of the general population that results in a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW).  The anatomic substrate is a band of myocytes that bridges the fibrous junction between the atrium and the ventricle.\n【8】 # Conditions Involving Bundle of Kent\n【9】 Problems arise when this pathway creates an electrical circuit that bypasses the AV node.  The AV node has rate-slowing electrical regulatory properties, whereas the pathway via the bundle of Kent does not.  When an aberrant electrical impulse travels through the Kent bundle, tachyarrhythmia ensues.\n【10】 # Treatment\n【11】 In order to treat persons with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, destruction of the bundle of Kent is accomplished by radiofrequency catheter ablation.

It includes central obesity (excessive abdominal fat), insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia.# Putting this guideline into practice\n【80】 NICE has produced tools and resources to help you put this guideline into practice.\n【81】 Putting recommendations into practice can take time. How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.\n【82】 Changes recommended for clinical practice that can be done quickly – like changes in prescribing practice – should be shared quickly. This is because healthcare professionals should use guidelines to guide their work – as is required by professional regulating bodies such as the General Medical and Nursing and Midwifery Councils.\n【83】 Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).\n【84】 Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.\n【85】 Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:\n【86】 . Raise awareness through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away.\n【87】 . Identify a lead with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues locally.\n【88】 . Carry out a baseline assessment against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision.\n【89】 . Think about what data you need to measure improvement and plan how you will collect it. You may want to work with other health and social care organisations and specialist groups to compare current practice with the recommendations. This may  help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation.\n【90】 . Develop an action plan, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases.\n【91】 . For very big changes include milestones and a business case, which will set out additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information professionals.\n【92】 . Implement the action plan with oversight from the lead and the project group. Big projects may  need project management support.\n【93】 . Review and monitor how well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners.\n【94】 NICE provides a comprehensive programme of support and resources to maximise uptake and use of evidence and guidance.  our into practice pages for more information.\n【95】 Also see Leng G, Moore V, Abraham S, editors  Achieving high quality care – practical experience from NICE. Chichester: Wiley.# Context\n【96】 Primary non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an excess of fat in the liver (steatosis) that is not a result of excessive alcohol consumption or other secondary causes. These secondary causes include side effects of certain medications, hepatitis C virus infection and particular endocrine conditions. NAFLD ranges from hepatic steatosis, through inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to fibrosis or cirrhosis.\n【97】 The prevalence of NAFLD in the general population is estimated at 20% to 30%. Around 2% to 3% of the population have NASH. NAFLD is more common in people who have type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.\n【98】 The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing, placing a greater burden on healthcare resources. The rate of progression of NAFLD is variable; being overweight and having diabetes are associated with an increased risk of progressive disease. The average age of people with NASH is 40 years to 50 years and for NASH-cirrhosis 50 years to 60 years. However the emerging epidemic of childhood obesity means that increasing numbers of younger people have NAFLD, with some prevalence studies showing that up to 38% of obese children have evidence of NAFLD. With NAFLD progressing through its spectrum even in childhood, the age that people develop significant liver disease is likely to fall and early diagnosis and management are therefore important at all ages. There is currently no licensed treatment for NAFLD. Guidance is needed for use in both primary and secondary care settings.# Recommendations for research\n【99】 The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. The guideline committee's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.\n【100】 # Non-invasive tests for diagnosing NAFLD in adults\n【101】 Which non-invasive tests are most accurate and cost-effective in identifying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults with risk factors, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome?\n【102】 ## Why this is important\n【103】 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in over 50% of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Untreated it can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. In most patients NAFLD is asymptomatic and is only detected incidentally when liver blood tests or abdominal ultrasound are performed for some other reason. Even then, more than 80% of patients with NAFLD have normal routine liver blood tests. There is an urgent need for a simple, accessible, cost-effective, non-invasive test capable of case-finding NAFLD in the huge numbers of people at risk.\n【104】 The 'gold standard' for diagnosis is liver biopsy. It is not feasible to perform liver biopsy in large numbers of at risk patients, so magnetic resonance based techniques are increasingly used as the comparison in studies assessing non-invasive tests for NAFLD. These demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy but are impractical or too expensive for large scale case finding.\n【105】 # Non-invasive tests for diagnosing NASH\n【106】 Which non-invasive tests most accurately identify non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?\n【107】 ## Why this is important\n【108】 NASH develops in only a minority of people with NAFLD. It is thought to be the precursor of liver fibrosis, which is associated with morbidity and mortality. As a result, NASH has been the main target for treatment in NAFLD. This is because reducing the severity of NASH would reduce the risk of a person progressing to fibrosis and advanced liver disease. However, the only way to identify people with NASH is by performing an invasive liver biopsy which is impractical in view of its risks to health and cost. Given that between 20 and 30% of the population have NAFLD, it is important that we have a simple non-invasive method for determining which people have NASH. Then they can start treatment to reduce the risk of developing fibrosis and complications of end-stage liver disease.\n【109】 # Non-invasive tests for diagnosing NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis in children and young people\n【110】 Which non-invasive tests most accurately diagnose NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis in children and young people?\n【111】 ## Why this is important\n【112】 NAFLD has become the most common chronic liver disease in children and young people in industrialised countries, mainly as a result of obesity.\n【113】 NAFLD is often suspected in children and young people with abnormal liver tests or evidence of fatty changes on ultrasound. However, the spectrum of NAFLD (from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver-related morbidity) can be present in the absence of abnormal liver tests. Early detection and assessment of severity of NAFLD would help identify potential silent progressive fatty liver disease.\n【114】 Diagnostic practice varies and includes clinical, biochemical and radiographic tests. The evidence review showed that few diagnostic techniques have been assessed in children and young people. There is some evidence for ELF in diagnosing advanced liver fibrosis in children and young people with NAFLD, but only from 1 study. Further research is needed to confirm the most accurate tests in this group.\n【115】 # Probiotic and prebiotic supplements\n【116】 What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of probiotics or prebiotics to treat NAFLD in adults, young people and children?\n【117】 ## Why this is important\n【118】 NAFLD is the most common metabolic liver disease, occurring in approximately 30% of all adults, around 46% of obese people and around 53% of people with type 2 diabetes. Liver fat accumulation is the first stage of more serious chronic liver disease in NAFLD. A small body of evidence supports the use of probiotics in NAFLD but the data are inconclusive and high-quality double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials are needed. The evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests associations between unfavourable disturbance in gut microbiota and obesity or type 2 diabetes, but there is very limited evidence on whether modifying the gut microbiota influences NAFLD.\n【119】 # Pharmacological therapy for advanced liver fibrosis in children and young people\n【120】 What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmacological therapy in children and young people with advanced liver fibrosis?\n【121】 ## Why this is important\n【122】 Observational studies reported that up to 10% of children and young people diagnosed with NAFLD progress to advanced liver fibrosis and are at risk of developing advanced stages of liver disease. Pharmacological treatment (for example, pioglitazone or vitamin E) could prevent progression to advanced liver fibrosis or end-stage liver disease, as has been reported in a number of high quality studies in adults with confirmed NAFLD. There are insufficient data on the efficacy of similar pharmacological treatment in children and young people with NAFLD to make clear treatment recommendations.\n", "seq_id": 2117, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#98#98#最后一句缺少换行", "type3": "无关文本#95#95#参考文献\n无关文本#102#102#与内容无关\n无关文本#107#107#与内容无关\n无关文本#111#111#与内容无关\n无关文本#117#117#与内容无关\n无关文本#121#121#与内容无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-17 19:40:57"}

Parents and carers have the right to be involved in planning and making decisions about their baby's health and care, and to be given information and support to enable them to do this, as set out in the NHS Constitution and summarised in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\n【4】 Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off‑label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\n【5】 Please note that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has produced guidance on COVID-19 infection and pregnancy for all midwifery and obstetric services.\n【6】 This guideline uses the term 'woman' or 'mother' and includes all people who have given birth, even if they may not identify as women or mothers. 'Woman' is generally used but in some instances, 'mother' is used when referring to her in relation to her baby.\n【7】 This guideline uses the term 'partner' to refer to the woman's chosen supporter. This could be the baby's father, the woman's partner, a family member or friend, or anyone who the woman feels supported by or wishes to involve. The term 'parents' refers to those with the main responsibility for the care of a baby. This will often be the mother and the father, but many other family arrangements exist, including single parents.\n【8】 # Organisation and delivery of postnatal care\n【9】 ## Principles of care\n【10】 When caring for a woman who has recently given birth, listen to her and be responsive to her needs and preferences. Also see the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services.\n【11】 Be aware that the 2020 MBRRACE-UK reports on maternal and perinatal mortality showed that women and babies from some minority ethnic backgrounds and those who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of death and may need closer monitoring. The reports showed that:\n【12】 compared with white women (8 per 100,, the risk of maternal death during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after birth is:\n【13】 times higher in black women (34 per 100,\n【14】 times higher in mixed ethnicity women (25 per 100,\n【15】 times higher in Asian women (15 per 100,000; does not include Chinese women)\n【16】 the neonatal mortality rate is around 50% higher in black and Asian babies compared with white babies (17 compared with 25 per 10,\n【17】 women living in the most deprived areas are more than 2.5 times more likely to die compared with women living in the least deprived areas (6 compared with 15 per 100,\n【18】 the neonatal mortality rate increases according to the level of deprivation in the area the mother lives in, with almost twice as many babies dying in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived areas (12 compared with 22 per 10,.\n【19】 A woman may be supported by her partner in the postnatal period. Involve them according to the woman's wishes.\n【20】 When caring for a baby, remember that those with parental responsibility have the right be involved in the baby's care, if they choose.\n【21】 When giving information about postnatal care, use clear language and tailor the timing, content and delivery of information to the woman's needs and preferences. Information should support shared decision making and be:\n【22】 provided face-to-face and supplemented by virtual discussions and written formats, for example, digital, printed, braille or Easy Read\n【23】 -ffered throughout the woman's care\n【24】 individualised and sensitive\n【25】 supportive and respectful\n【26】 evidence based and consistent\n【27】 translated by an appropriate interpreter to overcome language barriers.For more guidance on communication, providing information (including different formats and languages) and shared decision making, see the NICE guidelines on patient experience in adult NHS services and shared decision making, and the NHS Accessible Information Standard.\n【28】 Check that the woman understands the information she has been given, and how it relates to her. Provide regular opportunities for her to ask questions, and set aside enough time to discuss any concerns.\n【29】 Follow the principles in the NICE guideline on pregnancy and complex social factors for women who may need additional support, for example:\n【30】 women who misuse substances\n【31】 recent migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, or women who have difficulty reading or speaking English\n【32】 young women aged under 20\n【33】 women who experience domestic abuse.\n【34】 For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on principles of care .\n【35】 Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: provision of information about the postnatal health of women.\n【36】 Loading.

Please wait.\n【429】 # Terms used in this guideline\n【430】 This section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline.\n【431】 ## Bonding and emotional attachment\n【432】 Bonding is the positive emotional and psychological connection that the parent develops with the baby.\n【433】 Emotional attachment refers to the relationship between the baby and parent, driven by innate behaviour and which ensures the baby's proximity to the parent and safety. Its development is a complex and dynamic process dependent on sensitive and emotionally attuned parent interactions supporting healthy infant psychological and social development and a secure attachment. Babies form attachments with a variety of caregivers but the first, and usually most significant of these, will be with the mother and/or father.\n【434】 ## Continuity of carer\n【435】 Better Births, a report by the National Maternity Review, defines continuity of carer as consistency in the midwifery team (between 4 and 8 individuals) that provides care for the woman and her baby throughout pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period. A named midwife coordinates the care and takes responsibility for ensuring the needs of the woman and her baby are met throughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal periods.\n【436】 For the purpose of this guideline, the definition of continuity of carer in the Better Births report has been adapted to include not just the midwifery team but any healthcare team involved in the care of the woman and her baby, including the health visitor team. It emphasises the importance of effective information transfer between the individuals within the team. Having continuity of carer means that a trusting relationship can be developed between the woman and the healthcare professional(s) who cares for her. For more information, see the NHS Implementing Better Births: continuity of carer.\n【437】 ## Effective feed\n【438】 In general, effective feeding includes the baby showing readiness to feed, rhythmic sucking, calmness during the feed and satisfactory weight gain. For a first feed at the breast or with a bottle, effective feeding is shown by the baby latching to the breast or drawing the teat into mouth when offered and showing some rhythmic sucking.\n【439】 ## First infant formula\n【440】 First infant formula or 'first milk' is the type of formula milk that is suitable for a baby from birth to 12 months.\n【441】 ## Low birth weight\n【442】 A birth weight of less than 2,500 grams regardless of gestational age.\n【443】 ## Nominal group technique\n【444】 This is a structured method that uses the opinions of individuals within a group to reach a consensus. It involves anonymous voting with an opportunity to provide comments. Options with low agreement are eliminated and options with high agreement are retained. Using the comments that individuals provide, options with medium agreement are revised and then considered in a second round. For more information, see supplement 1 on methods.\n【445】 ## Parental responsibility\n【446】 the government definition of parental responsibility.\n【447】 ## Parents\n【448】 Parents are those with the main responsibility for the care of a baby. This will often be the mother and the father, but many other family arrangements exist, including single parents.\n【449】 ## Partner\n【450】 Partner refers to the woman's chosen supporter. This could be the baby's father, the woman's partner, a family member or friend, or anyone who the woman feels supported by or wishes to involve.\n【451】 ## Prop feeding\n【452】 When a baby's feeding bottle is propped against a pillow or other support, rather than the baby and the bottle being held when feeding.\n【453】 ## Responsive feeding\n【454】 Responsive feeding means feeding in response to the baby's cues. It recognises that feeds are not just for nutrition, but  for love, comfort and reassurance between the baby and mother (or parent in case of bottle feeding). Responsive breastfeeding  involves a mother responding to her own desire to feed for her comfort or convenience. Responsive bottle feeding involves holding the baby close, pacing the feeds and avoiding forcing the baby to finish the feed by recognising signs that the baby has had enough milk, and to reduce the risk of overfeeding.

Please wait.# Rationale and impact\n【484】 These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n【485】 # Principles of care\n【486】 Recommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.7\n【487】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【488】 The committee agreed that one of the key principles of care in the postnatal period is to listen to women and be responsive to their needs, in line with the findings of the Ockenden report on maternity services at the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust. The NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services gives comprehensive guidance on individualised and person-centred care.\n【489】 The committee  agreed that healthcare professionals should be aware of the disproportionate maternal and neonatal mortality rates among women and babies from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in deprived areas, as highlighted by the 2020 MBRRACE-UK reports on maternal and perinatal mortality. This increased risk of death indicates that closer monitoring and lower thresholds for further care or admission might be needed. Future research could help understand these disparities and what interventions could improve the outcomes.\n【490】 The committee recognised that the home and family circumstances for women vary, and it is up to the woman who she may want to involve in her postnatal care. The committee  recognised the role of the baby's father or other parents (or whoever has parental responsibility) in the care of the baby.\n【491】 There was evidence that information given in the postnatal period is often inconsistent, and this was supported by the committee's experience. There was some evidence that information may need to be repeated at different times by different healthcare professionals. The committee agreed that this is good practice given the number of healthcare professionals that new parents are likely to come into contact with. They discussed concerns about the wide range and varied quality of information available from healthcare professionals, the internet and social media.\n【492】 The evidence showed that healthcare professionals are a trusted source of information, so the committee agreed that it is important for healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based and consistent information throughout the woman's care. It should  take into consideration the individual needs and preferences of the woman. The evidence suggested that it is helpful to deliver information in different formats, for example, face-to-face discussions and printed or digital materials. The NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services gives more information. The committee discussed the importance of allowing sufficient time for discussions.\n【493】 The NICE guideline on pregnancy and complex social factors provides guidance for the antenatal period for specific groups. The committee agreed that the principles of care that are not specific to the antenatal period can  be applied to the postnatal period for potentially vulnerable groups of women.\n【494】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【495】 There is some variation in what information is provided, and the recommendations may result in a change in practice for some centres, involving more training for healthcare professionals, and more time in postnatal appointments. The recommendations are expected to have a positive effect on women's experience of the healthcare service by increasing their confidence in the information provided. This may result in parents being more likely to follow the advice given, which may enable them to react more appropriately to difficulties and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality.\n【496】 Return to recommendations\n【497】 # Communication between healthcare professionals at transfer of care\n【498】 Recommendations 1.1.8 and 1.1.9\n【499】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【500】 The evidence highlighted issues that should be communicated between healthcare professionals at transfer of care, including the woman's history in relation to her pregnancy and birth experience, and any mental health problems or safeguarding issues. Based on this evidence and their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed the information that should be passed on when women transfer between services, so that healthcare professionals do not miss relevant information and the woman does not always have to repeat the same information to different healthcare professionals. What is relevant and the level of detail needed may vary depending on whether the healthcare professional is a GP, midwife or a health visitor.\n【501】 The committee  emphasised the importance of seamless transfer of care from midwifery to health visitor care so that there is continuous care provision.\n【502】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【503】 There is variation in practice regarding what information, if any, is transferred between the different teams. The recommendation should lead to clearer guidance, improve relevant transfer of information and improve care for women and babies.\n【504】 Return to recommendations\n【505】 # Transfer to community care\n【506】 Recommendations 1.1.10 to 1.1.13\n【507】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【508】 Studies looking at varying transfer timings showed that there was no consistent evidence about the best time to transfer the care of women and their babies to community care. Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that the timing should depend on the health and wellbeing of the woman and the baby. This  applies to the departure of the midwife in the case of a home birth. This will help to safely manage potential complications, prevent readmissions in the immediate postnatal period, and take into account any safeguarding concerns so that the woman and the baby are not discharged to an unsafe environment.\n【509】 Assessing the woman's bladder function to rule out urinary retention is important because undetected or unmanaged urinary retention can lead to serious long-term consequences such as urinary incontinence.\n【510】 Not passing meconium (the baby's first bowel movement) within the first 24 hours can be a sign of bowel obstruction, so it is important that parents know to seek advice from a healthcare professional. This might be for example a midwife, a doctor or, if the baby is thought to be seriously unwell, the emergency services.\n【511】 Observing at least 1 effective feed (regardless of the method of feeding) is important to establish feeding and lower the chance of feeding problems at home and the need for readmission.\n【512】 The committee  agreed that in order to reassure women that they and their babies are being taken care of, they should be given information about what happens next, what support is available and who to contact in case of concerns. It is  important to highlight the importance of pelvic floor exercises soon after birth to prevent potentially long-term and serious conditions such as incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.\n【513】 No evidence on timing of transfer to home care was identified for twins or triplets, but the committee agreed that the same principles apply for multiple births as for singleton births.\n【514】 Because of the lack of clear evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research on length of postpartum stay to assess how the length of the hospital stay after giving birth affects unplanned or emergency contacts with primary or secondary care.\n【515】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【516】 There is wide variation in practice in how long women stay in hospital after giving birth. The committee noted that observing a feed before transfer is already current practice in settings that are UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI)-accredited, but many providers in England do not have this accreditation. The recommendations should lead to more consistency. If potential problems are prevented or managed early, this could potentially lead to cost savings because of lower reattendance or readmission.\n【517】 Return to recommendations\n【518】 # First midwife visit after transfer of care from the place of birth or after a home birth\n【519】 Recommendation 1.1.14\n【520】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【521】 There was little evidence and the committee had low confidence in it, so the committee used their knowledge and experience to agree the timing of the first midwife visit. Having the first visit within 36 hours after transfer of care would usually mean that the visit is not left too long, so that any health or support needs can be identified early.\n【522】 The committee agreed that the first postnatal visit by the midwifery team should be by a midwife (and not, for example, by a maternity support worker), face-to-face and, depending on the woman's circumstances and preferences, in the home. This should enable a comprehensive assessment of the health and support needs of the woman and her baby.\n【523】 Because of the lack of evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research on the first midwife visit after discharge to assess how the timing of the first midwife visit after the transfer of care affects unplanned or emergency contacts with primary or secondary care.\n【524】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【525】 The recommendation should reduce variation in practice and improve care for women. The recommendation might affect practice because a midwife should attend the first postnatal visit, and in current practice this might be a maternity support worker or a student midwife instead. However, no significant resource implications are expected.\n【526】 Return to recommendations\n【527】 # First health visitor visit\n【528】 Recommendations 1.1.15 and 1.1.16\n【529】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【530】 No evidence was found about when the first postnatal health visitor visit should take place, so the committee used their knowledge and experience to agree the timing. The aim is to involve health visitors when they are most needed, and spread the visits evenly throughout the postnatal period.\n【531】 According to the Department of Health and Social Care's Healthy Child Programme, there should be 2 health visitor visits in the postnatal period. The first visit is often very soon after transfer of care from midwifery care (which usually takes places 10 to 14 days after birth). This creates a gap of several weeks before the second health visitor visit at around 6 to 8 weeks. The first 2 weeks after birth may be overwhelming for some families, with several visits from both the midwifery team and health visitors. Having the first postnatal health visitor visit 1 to 2 weeks after transfer of care from midwifery care will mean that the visits are more evenly spread out.\n【532】 Although the Healthy Child Programme includes an antenatal visit by the health visitor, the committee agreed that this does not always happen. If this is the case, an additional early postnatal visit by the health visitor to replace the missed antenatal visit could be considered to enable the health visitor to get to know the family and their circumstances early on.\n【533】 Because of the lack of evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research on the most effective timing of the first postnatal visit by a health visitor.\n【534】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【535】 There is variation in when the first postnatal health visitor visit takes place. However, 1 of the key performance indicators of the Healthy Child Programme is that the first postnatal health visitor visit takes place between 10 and 14 days after birth, so the recommendation would mean a change in practice. The recommendation aims to reduce variation in practice and improve care for women and their babies. Some additional resources may be needed to organise an additional early postnatal visit by a health visitor in the exceptional circumstance when a mandated antenatal health visitor visit has not taken place; however, the resource impact of this is not considered to be large, and is likely outweighed by the potential benefits.\n【536】 Return to recommendations\n【537】 # Assessment and care of the woman\n【538】 Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.12\n【539】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【540】 The recommendations were not developed by the usual NICE guideline systematic review process because of the scale and complexity of the topic. Using the nominal group technique to vote on statements about the content of postnatal care contacts, the committee made recommendations through formal consensus because reaching consensus by committee discussion alone would be challenging. The statements were based on a review, including critical appraisal, of existing guidelines and systematic reviews. The committee based the recommendations on these and their knowledge and experience.\n【541】 The committee agreed that at each postnatal contact, women's general health and wellbeing, including psychological and emotional health, should be assessed and women should be asked if they have any concerns. The committee  agreed the physical health areas that midwives should assess. In order to prevent serious outcomes, women should  be made aware of the signs and symptoms of potentially serious conditions so they can seek help. Women's physical health assessment is not in the remit of the health visitor but when there are concerns, either observed by the healthcare professional or expressed by the woman, all healthcare professionals, including health visitors, should refer or advise self-referral so that the woman can get appropriate assessment and care.\n【542】 The committee acknowledged that some women may want to talk about their birth experience. In some cases, women might need additional support in coping with their experience.\n【543】 No evidence was identified on the timing of the comprehensive routine postnatal check. Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed this should ideally happen between 6 and 8 weeks after birth, as is current practice, to coincide with the Public Health England newborn and infant physical examination.\n【544】 No evidence was identified about which tools are effective in the clinical postnatal review of women. A tool that has been tested and validated in an independent sample assessing postnatal physical and mental health problems could help identify those women who need additional care and support, so the committee made a recommendation for research on clinical tools to assess women's health.\n【545】 References were made to NICE guidelines on different conditions that may affect women postnatally. A bacterial infection could be transmitted to the baby, so it is important to assess the baby if the mother has suspected or confirmed puerperal sepsis.\n【546】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【547】 By ensuring that women's physical and psychological health and wellbeing is comprehensively assessed, and any problems are managed appropriately, there may be an increase in referrals if problems are identified. The committee agreed that any referrals would prevent delays in diagnosing and treating problems, and improve care.\n【548】 Return to recommendations\n【549】 # Postpartum bleeding\n【550】 Recommendations 1.2.13 and 1.2.14\n【551】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【552】 No relevant evidence was identified about how to assess early symptoms and signs of postpartum haemorrhage, so the committee used their knowledge and experience to make the recommendations. Discussing with women what to expect after birth helps women to distinguish between a normal amount of lochia (vaginal discharge containing blood, mucus and uterine tissue) and signs and symptoms of postpartum haemorrhage. Women should be advised to seek medical advice if they observe these signs or symptoms because postpartum haemorrhage can have severe consequences.\n【553】 The committee agreed that although all women are at risk of secondary postpartum haemorrhage, some factors increase this risk and these should be taken into account when assessing the severity of blood loss. The risk factors for postpartum haemorrhage are listed in the NICE guideline on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies. The committee used their knowledge and experience to list other factors that might worsen the consequences of postpartum bleeding so that appropriate action can be taken.\n【554】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【555】 It is not routine practice to discuss what blood loss to expect postnatally, so the recommendations will involve a minor change to current practice but will potentially improve outcomes by early identification of secondary postpartum haemorrhage.\n【556】 Return to recommendations\n【557】 # Perineal health\n【558】 Recommendations 1.2.15 to 1.2.22\n【559】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【560】 Perineal pain and its complications are often overlooked and falsely considered to be part of normal postnatal healing. However, early identification and management of perineal pain may prevent long-term consequences and improve the woman's overall experience of postnatal care. To help healthcare professionals identify women with perineal pain and to prompt appropriate care, healthcare professionals should ask women if they have any perineal concerns.\n【561】 Practical advice about how to maintain good perineal hygiene can prevent infection or complications. In order to assess changes in the severity of perineal pain over time, a validated pain score might help to give a clearer view. Physical examination of the perineum could help determine the severity or cause of the pain, or whether further action is needed. In some cases, medication might be needed to alleviate the pain.\n【562】 The committee emphasised that women with perineal wound breakdown should be urgently referred to appropriate maternity services for further management to prevent further complications and potential long-term adverse outcomes.\n【563】 There was evidence that prolonged perineal pain and severity of pain is associated with depressive symptoms. There was no other relevant evidence about perineal pain, but the committee agreed, based on their knowledge and experience, that it can have negative long-term implications. To help healthcare professionals identify women with persistent or worsening perineal pain and to prompt appropriate care, they should be aware of the factors that can increase the risk of persistent postnatal perineal pain.\n【564】 Because of the lack of evidence about what characteristics of perineal pain suggest the need for further evaluation, a recommendation for research on perineal pain was made.\n【565】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【566】 In current practice, some women only receive treatment for perineal complications when the situation has become serious. By ensuring that perineal pain is identified early and treated without delay, then further complications and long-term consequences can be avoided. There may be an increase in referrals to secondary care for women who are usually seen by their GP, but the recommendations should improve care and outcomes.\n【567】 Return to recommendations\n【568】 # Assessment and care of the baby\n【569】 Recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.12\n【570】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【571】 Most of the recommendations in this section were not developed by the usual NICE guideline systematic review process because of the scale and complexity of the topic. Using the nominal group technique to vote on statements about the content of postnatal care contacts, the committee made recommendations through formal consensus because reaching consensus by committee discussion alone would be challenging. The statements were based on a review, including critical appraisal, of existing guidelines and systematic reviews. The committee based the recommendations on these, and their knowledge and experience.\n【572】 The general wellbeing, feeding and development of the baby should be assessed at every postnatal contact so that any concerns can be identified early. Not passing meconium (the baby's first bowel movement) within the first 24 hours can be a sign of bowel obstruction, so it is important that healthcare professionals engaging with the family in the immediate postnatal period are aware of the need for advice from a doctor.\n【573】 There was no reason for the committee to change the current recommended assessment criteria that healthcare professionals should use within 72 hours after the birth. The committee agreed that the same criteria could be used in the 6‑ to 8‑week assessment. The recommendation about weight and head circumference measurement is based on guidance from the UK-WHO (World Health Organization) growth charts.\n【574】 The recommendations refer to other NICE guidelines for guidance on specific clinical situations, and relevant NHS screening programmes.\n【575】 To help parents, healthcare professionals should  discuss and provide information about how to care for their baby. Established guidance exists on safer sleeping practices, and resources for these are available from, for example, UNICEF, Baby Sleep Information Source (Basis), and the Lullaby Trust.\n【576】 Baby Check is a scoring system intended to help in the assessment of babies up to 6 months of age, taking into account the presence or absence of various symptoms and signs of illness. It gives an overall score to help in deciding whether the baby may need clinical assessment or care. Although the evidence base for the Baby Check was predominantly in relation to babies attending secondary care, there was evidence that in the community setting, it can identify babies who are likely to be well. Also, the studies included babies ranging from birth to 6 months and were not therefore specifically focused on those in the early weeks of life.\n【577】 The Lullaby Trust has produced parent-friendly modified versions of the Baby Check scoring system, in the form of a mobile app and a downloadable booklet. Although the modifications are mostly related to the language used, the committee had some concerns because the modified versions have not been validated, and neither has the use of Baby Check by parents, as opposed to healthcare professionals. Finally, the committee noted that the Lullaby Trust's modified versions have adopted current practices regarding temperature measurement (armpit or ear), and this differs from the original Baby Check evaluations, which use rectal temperature.\n【578】 Although Baby Check cannot therefore provide complete reassurance, the committee agreed that the Baby Check scoring system could be helpful to parents as a 'checklist' of symptoms and signs of possible illness when they are uncertain whether their baby might be unwell and deciding whether to seek advice from a healthcare professional. The committee agreed it would be best for parents to be given information about Baby Check in advance rather than when they are concerned about their baby's wellbeing.\n【579】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【580】 The recommendations largely reflect current practice. There may be an increase in the use of Baby Check scoring system by parents. It is not known if this would have an impact on parents seeking advice from healthcare professionals, but the impact would not be expected to be large.\n【581】 Return to recommendations\n【582】 # Bed sharing\n【583】 Recommendations 1.3.13 and 1.3.14\n【584】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【585】 There was evidence of varying quality from multiple studies about the different risk factors associated with sudden unexpected death in infancy when bed sharing (up to 1 year of age). Based on the evidence and their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed the safe bed sharing practices that should be discussed with all parents and the circumstances in which bed sharing with a baby should be strongly advised against. The evidence  showed an association between bed sharing and breastfeeding although there is uncertainty about the causality. Preterm babies are outside the remit of this guideline and are therefore not mentioned in the recommendations; however, the committee were aware of evidence showing an increased risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy when bed sharing with a baby born preterm.\n【586】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【587】 In current practice, there is confusion and mixed messages from both healthcare professionals and within the community on the best practice for safe sleeping, including advice about never sharing a bed with a baby. These recommendations should lead to clear guidance, reduce variation in practice, and improve care for women and babies.\n【588】 Return to recommendations\n【589】 # Promoting emotional attachment\n【590】 Recommendations 1.3.15 to 1.3.18\n【591】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【592】 There was limited evidence on how to promote attachment between the mother and baby, and it did not show any specific interventions to be effective, so the recommendations are based on the committee's knowledge and experience. The committee agreed to make the recommendations for parents, not just the mother, because discussing and recognising the issues related to developing emotional attachment are relevant for other parental caregivers as well.\n【593】 The committee agreed that discussions about emotional attachment should begin antenatally and continue into the postnatal period. The committee highlighted that emotional attachment will usually happen naturally if the primary carer is able to spend quality time with their baby. The value of such quality time is not always recognised as important by the parent(s) when there are so many other demands on parents' time in the postnatal period.\n【594】 The committee recognised that attachment can  be affected by the woman's wellbeing, recovery from birth and other demands that parenthood brings. Therefore, it is important to discuss these issues with the parents to support them in building a relationship with their baby. It was considered important for the woman's partner (if there is one) to understand the various challenging aspects that the mother might be experiencing in the postnatal period, which might affect bonding and emotional attachment.\n【595】 Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee highlighted particular groups of parents who may be more vulnerable to difficulties in attachment and may need more support.\n【596】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【597】 There is variation in practice regarding what women are offered in support relating to emotional attachment. The recommendations should lead to clear guidance, reduce variation in practice and improve care for women.\n【598】 Return to recommendations\n【599】 # Symptoms and signs of illness in babies\n【600】 Recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.10\n【601】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【602】 It is important to identify babies who are seriously ill early so that the condition can be managed and adverse outcomes can be avoided. In the committee's experience, parents' concern about 'something being not quite right' can sometimes be overlooked, but it can be an important sign of serious illness and should be taken seriously.\n【603】 Baby Check is a scoring system intended to help in the assessment of babies up to 6 months of age, taking into account the presence or absence of various symptoms and signs of illness. It gives an overall score to help in deciding whether the baby may need clinical assessment or care. Based on the evidence in the secondary care setting, its sensitivity to identify those babies who are seriously ill varied. In the community setting, it was found to identify babies who are well suggesting that further assessment is not needed but the evidence regarding its accuracy in identifying seriously ill babies is lacking. Also, the studies in which it was being tested included babies ranging from birth to 6 months and were not therefore specifically focused on those in the early weeks of life as this guideline.\n【604】 The Lullaby Trust has produced parent-friendly modified versions of the Baby Check scoring system, in the form of a mobile app and a downloadable booklet. Although the modifications are mostly related to the language used, the committee had some concerns because the modified versions have not been validated, and neither has the use of Baby Check by parents, as opposed to healthcare professionals. Finally, the committee noted that the Lullaby Trust's modified versions have adopted current practices regarding temperature measurement (armpit or ear), and this differs from the original Baby Check evaluations, which use rectal temperature.\n【605】 For these reasons, the committee agreed that Baby Check should not be used in isolation to determine the need for further assessment or care but that it could be a helpful tool when used in addition to clinical judgement. Also, by focusing attention on important symptoms and signs, it could help during a remote assessment as a communication aid between healthcare professionals and parents.\n【606】 The committee  noted that sometimes the presence of fever in young babies is not recognised as a serious concern. It is particularly important to note changes in the baby's wellbeing and behaviour.\n【607】 There was evidence that single signs and symptoms are not necessarily useful predictors of serious illness on their own. However, based on various other NICE guidelines, there are some 'red flag' symptoms and signs that indicate a serious illness that needs immediate action.\n【608】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【609】 The recommendations should reinforce current good practice and improve care for babies. There may be an increase in the use of the Baby Check scoring system as a supplemental tool for healthcare professionals, particularly during remote appointments.\n【610】 Return to recommendations\n【611】 # General principles about babies' feeding\n【612】 Recommendation 1.5.1\n【613】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【614】 Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that the choices parents make around feeding are not easy and sometimes their preferred choice might not be an option for them. Evidence among parents who bottle fed their babies showed that they sometimes felt judged by the healthcare professionals about their choices. Therefore, the committee agreed that as a general principle, discussions around feeding should be respectful and acknowledge the various consequences different feeding options may have.\n【615】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【616】 There is some variation in practice, so the recommendation aims to improve the consistency of support given to parents about feeding their baby.\n【617】 Return to recommendations\n【618】 # Giving information about breastfeeding\n【619】 Recommendations 1.5.2 to 1.5.5\n【620】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【621】 Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that discussion and support around breastfeeding should start in the antenatal period so that women are equipped to make decisions about feeding and are prepared to start breastfeeding when the baby is born. The discussions and support should continue in the postnatal period so that any questions and concerns can be addressed and women feel they are being supported.\n【622】 There was good evidence about women being motivated by the many benefits of breastfeeding, so it is important to share these with the women. It is established knowledge that breastfeeding has nutritional and health benefits for the baby (such as lower rates of infection) and some health benefits for the woman (such as lower risk of breast cancer). There was evidence that women felt they were able to soothe and comfort the baby by breastfeeding.\n【623】 The committee agreed that it is important to explain that breastfeeding can have benefits even if done for a short period of time. For example, colostrum (the breast milk that is produced in the first few days) is known to have various nutritional and health benefits for the baby.\n【624】 The committee  agreed that parents should receive information about partners' involvement in supporting breastfeeding. The evidence showed that some women and their families believed that bottle feeding was a way for the baby to bond with their partner or other family members. The committee agreed that partners and family members should be given information about alternative ways to comfort and bond with the baby.\n【625】 Because breastfeeding women may be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, they should be informed about the NICE recommendation about taking vitamin D supplementation.\n【626】 There was evidence that some women thought that other people felt that breastfeeding in public is inappropriate or insensitive to other people's feelings, which can be a barrier for breastfeeding in public places. The committee agreed the importance of reassuring women and their partners that under the 2010 Equality Act, women have the right to breastfeed in 'any public space'.\n【627】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【628】 The recommendations largely reflect current practice and should reinforce good practice across the country.\n【629】 Return to recommendations\n【630】 # Role of the healthcare professional supporting breastfeeding\n【631】 Recommendations 1.5.6 to 1.5.8\n【632】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【633】 Feeding is an integral part of the postnatal period, so healthcare professionals should have the relevant knowledge to encourage breastfeeding and to support women to establish and continue breastfeeding. The BNF provides useful information on safe medicine use and prescribing for women who are breastfeeding. If needed, further advice is available from an NHS medicines information centre or other specialist sources.\n【634】 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding is started early in order to facilitate establishment of breastfeeding, and the committee agreed that healthcare professionals caring for women and babies in the immediate postnatal period should encourage early skin-to-skin contact to help start breastfeeding when the baby and the mother feel ready.\n【635】 The committee agreed that healthcare professionals should be sensitive to the individual preferences, experiences and values of the woman when supporting her with breastfeeding. There was evidence that after birth, women value having privacy in hospital, and a lack of privacy can be a barrier to breastfeeding and expressing breast milk. However, the committee noted that healthcare professionals  need to be able to carry out clinical observations of women easily, so recommended that these needs be balanced against each other.\n【636】 The evidence  showed that varying experiences with breastfeeding can have an impact on the woman's emotional wellbeing, and women often need reassurance and encouragement to gain confidence.\n【637】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【638】 In the committee's experience, some healthcare professionals caring for women and babies during the postnatal period may not have adequate knowledge to support women with breastfeeding and might need more training. The recommendations should reinforce best clinical practice and lead to better consistency of care.\n【639】 Return to recommendations\n【640】 # Supporting women to breastfeed\n【641】 Recommendations 1.5.9 to 1.5.12\n【642】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【643】 There was evidence that women value breastfeeding care that provides individualised support and continuity of carer, and feel that 'remote' support (such as online or telephone support) can be a helpful addition but should not replace face-to-face support.\n【644】 The evidence  showed that partners often feel that they lack knowledge and understanding of breastfeeding, and want to know how they can best support breastfeeding mothers.\n【645】 There was evidence that women find peer support valuable. Through peer support, women can share their experiences and gain information and social contacts, which can provide ongoing support.\n【646】 There was no evidence that extra interventions increase breastfeeding rates so the committee agreed that breastfeeding support should be an integral part of standard postnatal care contacts.\n【647】 There was some evidence that younger women may have additional barriers to breastfeeding, such as feeling alone in the maternity unit, the feeling of needing to 'carry on with life' and therefore choosing to formula feed, and lack of peer support. Evidence  suggested that additional support may be beneficial for improving the rate of breastfeeding among women from low income or socially disadvantaged backgrounds.\n【648】 The evidence showed that women value support and practical information about breastfeeding, as well as information about the underlying physiology of breastfeeding. This will help them to recognise what is or is not normal, and when to seek help. The evidence  showed that some common features of breastfeeding, such as sore nipples, can discourage women if they do not know in advance what to expect.\n【649】 There was no evidence about breastfeeding support for parents of twins or triplets, so the committee made a recommendation for research.\n【650】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【651】 There is significant variation in the provision of practical and professional breastfeeding support, so the recommendations will support best practice in some settings and improve practice in other settings. They will reduce variation in practice and improve care for women and babies. Providing continuity of carer may have an impact on how services are organised, but no significant resource impact is expected.\n【652】 Return to recommendations\n【653】 # Assessing breastfeeding\n【654】 Recommendations 1.5.13 to 1.5.15\n【655】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【656】 Assessing breastfeeding is an important part of postnatal contacts. None of the clinical tools identified in the evidence review were useful in identifying women who would not be breastfeeding (or exclusively breastfeeding) at follow up, which was considered an indication of breastfeeding difficulties, so the committee did not recommend any tools. The committee used their knowledge and experience to make the recommendations, in line with the principles in the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) breastfeeding assessment tool, including asking the parents about any concerns and about indications of successful breastfeeding.\n【657】 In addition, observing a feed twice in the first week can help establish good breastfeeding practice. Additional observations or interventions may be needed if there are ongoing concerns.\n【658】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【659】 In current practice, observing a full feed in the first week might not always happen, so this may mean a change in practice and may have some impact on time needed at the postnatal contacts. The recommendations are based on the UNICEF BFI breastfeeding assessment tool, which is already widely used in practice. In places where it is not already used, the committee were aware that work is underway to reach that standard. The recommendations will improve and standardise practice.\n【660】 Return to recommendations\n【661】 # Formula feeding\n【662】 Recommendations 1.5.16 to 1.5.20\n【663】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【664】 The committee recognised that babies can be formula fed in combination with breastmilk or they can be fed with formula milk only. There was good evidence about what information and support parents who formula feed find helpful, so the committee used the evidence together with their knowledge and experience to make the recommendations. Common themes in the evidence were the lack of impartial information about formula feeding, women feeling that they were not supported in their feeding choices, and the emotional impact that feeding choices can have on parents. The committee agreed that, as for women who breastfeed, women who formula feed should be supported regardless of their feeding choices. The recommendations reflect the key features of formula feeding support and the information that should be given to women and their families if they are formula feeding or are considering to formula feed and who need to formula feed because of a medical or other reason.\n【665】 The evidence showed that women value face-to-face feeding support but  feel that additional information to support feeding can be helpful. The evidence showed that women who are formula feeding feel that they are not given the information or support they need, for example, about how to interpret and respond to the baby's behaviours and cues, and how to formula feed safely. Based on the committee's experience, it is important to give information about how to hold the baby and how feeding can be used as an opportunity to bond with the baby, and  advise parents against using a 'propped up' bottle during a feed because it can be harmful for the baby.\n【666】 The evidence  showed that women were unaware of the impact introducing formula feeding could have on breastfeeding and felt unsupported by healthcare professionals when considering this. Therefore, the committee agreed it was important that women were supported to make an informed, guilt-free decision by providing balanced and evidence-based information.\n【667】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【668】 The committee noted that there is significant variation in practice in providing formula feeding support, so the recommendations will support best practice in some settings and improve practice in other settings. Overall, they will improve consistency.\n【669】 Return to recommendations\n【670】 # Lactation suppression\n【671】 Recommendation 1.5.21\n【672】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【673】 No evidence was identified on the information and support that should be given to women about lactation suppression. The committee discussed when discussions about lactation suppression should happen and what should be discussed, and used their knowledge and experience to agree the recommendation. The committee agreed that discussions should be sensitive and individualised according to the woman's situation. Practical advice about how to ease the process of milk drying up can be helpful for women, and in some cases, medicine to suppress lactation might  be appropriate to make the process quicker, although for most this is not needed.\n【674】 Donating breast milk to a local breast milk bank, depending on the local services, could be valuable to some women who cannot breastfeed their own baby.\n【675】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【676】 The recommendation largely reflects current practice and should reinforce best practice. To ensure that women understand the information they are given, and that information is being provided at the most appropriate time, some extra time from healthcare professionals may be needed.\n【677】 Return to recommendations# Context\n【678】 Approximately 700,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year. For women, their partners and their babies, this is a major life event that means considerable emotional and physical adjustment. It applies to all births but is perhaps most marked for those having their first child. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility to help families adjust to their new life, but at the same time they have to be able to spot and care for the families where complications arise.\n【679】 Postnatal care has for long been regarded as a 'Cinderella service' where in comparison with some other European countries, provision is scanty and inadequate. This approach risks missing an opportunity to have a profoundly beneficial effect on the lives of the babies and their families, now and in the future. In a National Childbirth Trust (NCT) survey: left to your own devices – the postnatal care experiences of 1,260 first-time mothers, 1 in 8 women were highly critical of their postnatal care. Their feedback reflects fragmentation of care, poor planning and communication between healthcare professionals, and insufficient advice about emotional recovery. Furthermore, women continue to report receiving insufficient or inconsistent information on baby's feeding, particularly after giving birth to their first baby.\n【680】 This guideline addresses the organisation and delivery of postnatal care, including the relationship between the different agencies that share the responsibility for postnatal care; assessment and health of women; assessment and health of babies; how to help parents form strong relationships with their babies; and babies' feeding. It specifically does not cover issues covered by other NICE guidelines, in particular problems of mental health, preterm birth or specialist care (care beyond routine postnatal care), but refers to other NICE guidelines, where appropriate.\n【681】 This guideline covers the postnatal period up to 8 weeks after birth. However, the sections on babies' feeding and emotional attachment  address the antenatal period because discussion around these is essential already during pregnancy. The postnatal period of course does not end at 8 weeks. A time point of 8 weeks was agreed in order to focus the guideline on the most critical early weeks after birth. The remit for some of the topics in this guideline was to address the needs of families giving birth to twins and triplets in addition to single babies. The evidence specific to twins and triplets was lacking and the consensus was that healthcare professionals and families dealing with twins or triplet births should use the recommendations of the guideline within the constraints of the changed circumstances of having to care for more than 1 child.\n【682】 The committee were aware of the higher postnatal mortality rates among women of black, Asian and minority ethnic origin and women living in deprived areas reported in the MBRRACE-UK report: saving lives, improving mothers' care . Black women in particular had an over four‑fold increase in maternal mortality rates compared with white women. The MBRRACE-UK report: perinatal mortality surveillance report   highlights the higher neonatal mortality rates for babies of black and Asian ethnicity and babies born to mothers living in deprived areas. It is important that clinicians are aware of these inequalities in clinical practice.\n【683】 This guideline was written with the hope that healthcare professionals can use it to provide consistent and high-quality care, while taking into consideration each family's individual situation and needs, in order to reduce morbidity and mortality and to support families in this new phase.\n", "seq_id": 1562, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#454#454#最后一句另起一行\n缺少换行#483#483#最后一句另起一行", "type3": "无关文本#27#27#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#36#36#最后两句与文本无关\n无关文本#46#46#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#53#56#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#70#70#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#71#72#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#76#77#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#81#83#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#90#90#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#92#92#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#95#95#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#110#110#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#126#125#首句与文本无关\n无关文本#134#145#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#156#158#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#177#179#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#200#201#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#210#212#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#216#218#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#230#232#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#250#252#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#292#294#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#300#302#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#312#312#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#314#319#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#334#336#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#363#368#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#389#391#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#410#412#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#425#430#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#444#444#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#454#454#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#458#463#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#466#468#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#471#473#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#476#478#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#481#483#倒数第两句与文本无关\n无关文本#496#498#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#504#506#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#517#519#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#526#528#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#536#538#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#548#550#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#556#558#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#567#569#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#574#574#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#581#583#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#588#590#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#598#560#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#610#612#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#617#619#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#629#631#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#639#641#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#652#654#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#660#662#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#669#671#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#677#677#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#680#680#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 19:23:30"}

Common adverse reactions include headache, hypertension, and transaminase increases.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 Indication\n【8】 - Siponimod is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.\n【9】 Dosage\n【10】 - The recommended maintenance dosage is 2 mg\n【11】 - The recommended maintenance dosage in patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype is 1 mg\n【12】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【14】 There is limited information regarding siponimod Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n【15】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【16】 There is limited information regarding siponimod Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n【17】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【18】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【19】 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n【20】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【21】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 There is limited information regarding siponimod Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【23】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【24】 There is limited information regarding siponimod Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【25】 # Contraindications\n【26】 Siponimod is contraindicated in patients who have:\n【27】 - A CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype\n【28】 - In the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III or IV heart failure\n【29】 - Presence of Mobitz type II second-degree, third-degree AV block, or sick sinus syndrome, unless patient has a functioning pacemaker\n【30】 # Warnings\n【31】 Risk of Infections\n【32】 - Siponimod causes a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20%-30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Siponimod may therefore increase the risk of infections, some serious in nature. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in association with siponimod.\n【33】 - In Study 1 , the overall rate of infections was comparable between the siponimod-treated patients and those on placebo (49.0% vs. 49.1% respectively). However, herpes zoster, herpes infection, bronchitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection were more common in siponimod-treated patients. In Study 1, serious infections occurred at a rate of 2.9% in siponimod-treated patients compared to 2.5% of patients receiving placebo.\n【34】 - Before initiating treatment with siponimod, results from a recent complete blood count (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be reviewed.\n【35】 - Initiation of treatment with siponimod should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. Because residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after discontinuation of siponimod, vigilance for infection should be continued throughout this period.\n【36】 - Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while on therapy. Suspension of treatment with siponimod should be considered if a patient develops a serious infection.\n【37】 Cryptococcal Infections\n【38】 - Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and disseminated cryptococcal infections have been reported with another sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Rare cases of CM have  occurred with siponimod. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or signs of CM. Patients with symptoms or signs consistent with a cryptococcal infection should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Siponimod treatment should be suspended until a cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.\n【39】 Herpes Viral Infections\n【40】 - Cases of herpes viral infection, including one case of reactivation of VZV infection leading to varicella zoster meningitis, have been reported in the development program of siponimod. In Study 1, the rate of herpetic infections was 4.6% in siponimod-treated patients compared to 3.0% of patients receiving placebo. In Study 1, an increase in the rate of herpes zoster infections was reported in 2.5% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 0.7% of patients receiving placebo. Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox) or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating siponimod  Vaccinations below).\n【41】 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n【42】 - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.\n【43】 - No cases of PML have been reported in siponimod-treated patients in the development program; however, PML has been reported in patients treated with a S1P receptor modulator and other multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies and has been associated with some risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised patients, polytherapy with immunosuppressants). Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings that may be suggestive of PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with siponimod should be suspended until PML has been excluded.\n【44】 Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Anti-neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Immunosuppressive Therapies\n【45】 - Anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) should be coadministered with caution because of the risk of additive immune system effects during such therapy.\n【46】 Vaccinations\n【47】 - Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating siponimod treatment. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with siponimod, following which initiation of treatment with siponimod should be postponed for 4 weeks to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur.\n【48】 - The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while patients are taking siponimod and for 4 weeks after stopping treatment.\n【49】 - Vaccinations may be less effective if administered during siponimod treatment. Siponimod treatment discontinuation 1 week prior to and until 4 weeks after a planned vaccination is recommended.\n【50】 - Macular edema was reported in 1.8% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 0.2% of patients receiving placebo. The majority of cases occurred within the first four months of therapy.\n【51】 - An ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, is recommended in all patients before starting treatment and at any time if there is any change in vision while taking siponimod.\n【52】 - Continuation of siponimod therapy in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated. A decision on whether or not siponimod should be discontinued needs to take into account the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient.\n【53】 Macular Edema in Patients with a History of Uveitis or Diabetes Mellitus\n【54】 - Patients with a history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema during siponimod therapy. The incidence of macular edema is  increased in MS patients with a history of uveitis. In the clinical trial experience in adult patients with all doses of siponimod, the rate of macular edema was approximately 10% in MS patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus versus 2% in those without a history of these diseases. In addition to the examination of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment, MS patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of uveitis should have regular follow-up examinations.\n【55】 - Since initiation of siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, an up-titration scheme should be used to reach the maintenance dosage of siponimod.\n【56】 - Siponimod was not studied in patients who had:\n【57】 In the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, or decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization\n【58】 New York Heart Association Class II-IV heart failure\n【59】 Cardiac conduction or rhythm disorders, including complete left bundle branch block, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block, symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Mobitz type II second degree AV-block or higher grade AV-block (either history or observed at screening), unless patient has a functioning pacemaker\n【60】 Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)\n【61】 Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs\n【62】 - In the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, or decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization\n【63】 - New York Heart Association Class II-IV heart failure\n【64】 - Cardiac conduction or rhythm disorders, including complete left bundle branch block, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block, symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Mobitz type II second degree AV-block or higher grade AV-block (either history or observed at screening), unless patient has a functioning pacemaker\n【65】 - Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)\n【66】 - Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs\n【67】 Reduction in Heart Rate\n【68】 - After the first titration dose of siponimod, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour, and the Day 1 decline is maximal at approximately 3-4 hours. With continued up-titration, further heart rate decreases are seen on subsequent days, with maximal decrease from Day 1-baseline reached on Day 5-6. The highest daily post-dose decrease in absolute hourly mean heart rate is observed on Day 1, with the pulse declining on average 5-6 bpm. Post-dose declines on the following days are less pronounced. With continued dosing, heart rate starts increasing after Day 6 and reaches placebo levels within 10 days after treatment initiation.\n【69】 - In Study 1, bradycardia occurred in 4.4% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 2.9% of patients receiving placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic. Few patients experienced symptoms, including dizziness or fatigue, and these symptoms resolved within 24 hours without intervention. Heart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed.\n【70】 Atrioventricular Conduction Delays\n【71】 - Initiation of siponimod treatment has been associated with transient atrioventricular conduction delays that follow a similar temporal pattern as the observed decrease in heart rate during dose titration. The AV conduction delays manifested in most of the cases as first-degree AV block (prolonged PR interval on ECG), which occurred in 5.1% of siponimod-treated patients and in 1.9% of patients receiving placebo in Study 1. Second-degree AV blocks, usually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), have been observed at the time of treatment initiation with siponimod in less than 1.7% of patients in clinical trials. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, resolved within 24 hours, rarely required treatment with atropine, and did not require discontinuation of siponimod treatment.\n【72】 - If treatment with siponimod is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought:\n【73】 In patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)\n【74】 In patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs\n【75】 In patients with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension\n【76】 In patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block\n【77】 - In patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)\n【78】 - In patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs\n【79】 - In patients with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension\n【80】 - In patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block\n【81】 Treatment-Initiation Recommendations\n【82】 - Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.\n【83】 - In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of siponimod treatment to help reduce cardiac effects.\n【84】 - In patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 bpm), first- or second-degree  AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset > 6 months prior to initiation, ECG testing and first-dose monitoring is recommended.\n【85】 - Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, siponimod is not recommended in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.\n【86】 - Use of siponimod in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.\n【87】 - Experience with siponimod is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart-rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate, such as ivabradine and digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during siponimod initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block.\n【88】 For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing siponimod treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, siponimod can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 50 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart-rate is greater than 50 bpm. Treatment with siponimod can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after siponimod has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage.\n【89】 For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate.\n【90】 - For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing siponimod treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, siponimod can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 50 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart-rate is greater than 50 bpm. Treatment with siponimod can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after siponimod has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage.\n【91】 - For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate.\n【92】 Missed Dose During Treatment Initiation and Reinitiation of Therapy Following Interruption\n【93】 - If a titration dose is missed or if 4 or more consecutive daily doses are missed during maintenance treatment, reinitiate Day 1 of the dose titration and follow titration monitoring recommendations.\n【94】 - Dose-dependent reductions in absolute forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV were observed in siponimod-treated patients as early as 3 months after treatment initiation. In a placebo-controlled trial in adult patients, the decline in absolute FEV1 from baseline compared to placebo was 88 mL  at 2 years. The mean difference between siponimod-treated patients and patients receiving placebo in percent predicted FEV1 at 2 years was 2.8% (95% CI: -4.5, -1.. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease in FEV1 after drug discontinuation. In Study 1, five patients discontinued siponimod because of decreases in pulmonary function testing. Siponimod has been tested in MS patients with mild to moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The changes in FEV1 were similar in this subgroup compared with the overall population. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy with siponimod if clinically indicated.\n【95】 - Elevations of transaminases may occur in siponimod-treated patients. Recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be reviewed before initiation of siponimod therapy.\n【96】 - In Study 1, elevations in transaminases and bilirubin were observed in 10.1% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 3.7% of patients receiving placebo, mainly because of transaminase  elevations.\n【97】 - In Study 1, ALT or AST increased to three and five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 5.6% and 1.4% of siponimod-treated patients, respectively, compared to 1.5% and 0.5% of patients receiving placebo, respectively. ALT or AST increased eight and ten times ULN in siponimod-treated patients (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively) compared to no patients receiving placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 months of starting treatment. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 1 month after discontinuation of siponimod. In clinical trials, siponimod was discontinued if the elevation exceeded a 3-fold increase and the patient showed symptoms related to hepatic dysfunction.\n【98】 - Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, rash with eosinophilia, or jaundice and/or dark urine during treatment, should have liver enzymes checked. siponimod should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed.\n【99】 - Although there are no data to establish that patients with preexisting liver disease are at increased risk to develop elevated liver function test values when taking siponimod, caution should be exercised when using siponimod in patients with a history of significant liver disease.\n【100】 - In Study 1, siponimod-treated patients had an average increase over placebo of approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure and 1.2 mmHg in diastolic pressure, which was first detected after approximately 1 month of treatment initiation and persisted with continued treatment. Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 12.5% of siponimod-treated patients and in 9.2% of patients receiving placebo. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment with siponimod and managed appropriately.\n【101】 - Based on animal studies, siponimod may cause fetal harm. Because it takes approximately 10 days to eliminate siponimod from the body, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during and for 10 days after stopping siponimod treatment.\n【102】 - Rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in patients receiving a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Such events have not been reported for siponimod-treated patients in the development program. However, should a siponimod-treated patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (e.g., cognitive deficits, behavioral changes, cortical visual disturbances, or any other neurological cortical symptoms/signs), any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase of intracranial pressure, or accelerated neurological deterioration, the physician should promptly schedule a complete physical and neurological examination and should consider a MRI. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, siponimod should be discontinued.\n【103】 - When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation, when initiating siponimod.\n【104】 - Initiating treatment with siponimod after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended.\n【105】 - Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping siponimod treatment. Patients should be observed for a severe increase in disability upon siponimod discontinuation and appropriate treatment should be instituted, as required.\n【106】 - After stopping siponimod therapy, siponimod remains in the blood for up to 10 days. Starting other therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to siponimod.\n【107】 - Lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range in 90% of patients within 10 days of stopping therapy. However, residual pharmacodynamics effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, and therefore caution should be applied 3-4 weeks after the last dose of siponimod.\n【108】 # Adverse Reactions\n【109】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【110】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n【111】 - A total of 1737 MS patients have received siponimod at doses of at least 2 mg daily. These patients were included in Study 1 and in a Phase 2 placebo-controlled study in patients with MS. In Study 1, 67% of siponimod-treated patients completed the double-blind part of the study, compared to 59.0% of patients receiving placebo. Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 8.5% of siponimod-treated patients, compared to 5.1% of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) in siponimod-treated patients in Study 1 were headache, hypertension, and transaminase increases.\n【112】 -  lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of siponimod-treated patients and at a rate at least 1% higher than in patients receiving placebo.\n【113】 - The following adverse reactions have occurred in less than 5% of siponimod-treated patients but at a rate at least 1% higher than in patients receiving placebo: herpes zoster, lymphopenia, seizure, tremor, macular edema, AV block (1st and 2nd degree), asthenia, and pulmonary function test decreased.\n【114】 Seizures\n【115】 - In Study 1, cases of seizures were reported in 1.7% of siponimod-treated patients, compared to 0.4% in patients receiving placebo. It is not known whether these events were related to the effects of MS, to siponimod, or to a combination of both.\n【116】 Respiratory Effects\n【117】 - Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV were observed in patients treated with siponimod\n【118】 Vascular Events\n【119】 - Vascular events, including ischemic strokes, pulmonary embolisms, and myocardial infarctions, were reported in 3.0% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 2.6% of patients receiving placebo. Some of these events were fatal. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of vascular events throughout treatment, even in the absence of previous vascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of cardiac or cerebral ischemia caused by vascular events and the steps to take if they occur.\n【120】 Malignancies\n【121】 - Malignancies such as malignant melanoma in situ and seminoma were reported in siponimod-treated patients in Study 1. An increased risk of cutaneous malignancies has been reported in association with another S1P modulator.\n【122】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【123】 There is limited information regarding Siponimod Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【124】 # Drug Interactions\n【125】 - Siponimod has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies. Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks following administration.\n【126】 - When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered in order to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects.\n【127】 - Because of the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects, initiating treatment with siponimod after alemtuzumab is not recommended.\n【128】 - Siponimod can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer acetate.\n【129】 - Siponimod has not been studied in patients taking QT prolonging drugs.\n【130】 - Class Ia (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) anti-arrhythmic drugs have been associated with cases of Torsades de Pointes in patients with bradycardia. If treatment with siponimod is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought.\n【131】 - Because of the potential additive effects on heart rate, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with QT prolonging drugs with known arrhythmogenic properties, heart rate lowering calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem), or other drugs that may decrease heart rate (e.g., ivabradine, digoxin). If treatment with siponimod is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non-heart-rate lowering drugs or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation.\n【132】 - Caution should be applied when siponimod is initiated in patients receiving treatment with a beta-blocker because of the additive effects on lowering heart rate; temporary interruption of the beta-blocker treatment may be needed prior to initiation of siponimod. Beta-blocker treatment can be initiated in patients receiving stable doses of siponimod.\n【133】 - During and for up to one month after discontinuation of treatment with siponimod, vaccinations may be less effective; therefore siponimod treatment should be paused 1 week prior and for 4 weeks after vaccination.\n【134】 - The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection and should therefore be avoided during siponimod treatment and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment with siponimod.\n【135】 - Because of a significant increase in exposure to siponimod, concomitant use of siponimod and drugs that cause moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibition is not recommended. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of a moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor in combination with a separate - moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.\n【136】 - Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of siponimod with moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors.\n【137】 - Because of a significant decrease in siponimod exposure, concomitant use of siponimod and drugs that cause moderate CYP2C9 and strong CYP3A4 induction is not recommended for all patients. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of moderate CYP2C9/strong CYP3A4 dual inducer (e.g., rifampin or carbamazepine) or a moderate CYP2C9 inducer in combination with a separate strong CYP3A4 inducer.\n【138】 - Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of siponimod with moderate CYP2C9 inducers.\n【139】 - Concomitant use of siponimod and moderate (e.g., modafinil, efavirenz) or strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended for patients with CYP2C9*1/*3 and*2/*3 genotype.\n【140】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【141】 ### Pregnancy\n【142】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【143】 Risk Summary\n【144】 - There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of siponimod in pregnant women. Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, siponimod can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman  Data). Reproductive and developmental studies in pregnant rats and rabbits have demonstrated siponimod-induced embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits and teratogenicity in rats. Increased incidences of post-implantation loss and fetal abnormalities (external, urogenital and skeletal) in rat and of embryo-fetal deaths, abortions and fetal variations (skeletal and visceral) in rabbit were observed following prenatal exposure to siponimod starting at a dose 2 times the exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose of 2 mg/day.\n【145】 - In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.\n【146】 Animal Data\n【147】 - When siponimod  of 2 mg/day.\n【148】 - When siponimod  for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in rabbits is less that than in humans at the RHD.\n【149】 - When siponimod  is less than the RHD, on a mg/m2 basis.\n【150】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【151】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Siponimod in women who are pregnant.\n【152】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【153】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Siponimod during labor and delivery.\n【154】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【155】 - There are no data on the presence of siponimod in human milk, the effects of siponimod on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. A study in lactating rats has shown excretion of siponimod and/or its metabolites in milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for siponimod and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from siponimod or from the underlying maternal condition.\n【156】 ### Pediatric Use\n【157】 - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n【158】 ### Geriatic Use\n【159】 - Clinical studies of siponimod did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n【160】 ### Gender\n【161】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Siponimod with respect to specific gender populations.\n【162】 ### Race\n【163】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Siponimod with respect to specific racial populations.\n【164】 ### Renal Impairment\n【165】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Siponimod in patients with renal impairment.\n【166】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【167】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Siponimod in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【168】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【169】 - Before initiation of siponimod treatment, women of childbearing potential should be counselled on the potential for a serious risk to the fetus and the need for effective contraception during treatment with siponimod. Since it takes approximately 10 days to eliminate the compound from the body after stopping treatment, the potential risk to the fetus may persist and women should use effective contraception during this period.\n【170】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【171】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Siponimod in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【172】 ### CYP2C9 Genotype\n【173】 Before initiation of treatment with siponimod, test patients to determine CYP2C9 genotype. Siponimod is contraindicated in patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 (i.e., CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype), which is approximately 0.4%-0.5% of Caucasians and less in others, because of substantially elevated siponimod plasma levels. Siponimod dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype because of an increase in exposure to siponimod.\n【174】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【175】 ### Administration\n【176】 Before initiation of treatment with siponimod, assess the following:\n【177】 CYP2C9 Genotype Determination\n【178】 - Test patients for CYP2C9 variants to determine CYP2C9 genotype. An FDA-cleared or -approved test for the detection of CYP2C9 variants to direct the use of siponimod is not currently available.\n【179】 Complete Blood Count\n【180】 - Review results of a recent complete blood count (CBC).\n【181】 Ophthalmic Evaluation\n【182】 - Obtain an evaluation of the fundus, including the macula\n【183】 Cardiac Evaluation\n【184】 - Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, advice from a cardiologist and first-dose monitoring is recommended.\n【185】 - Determine whether patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular (AV) conduction.\n【186】 Current or Prior Medications\n【187】 - If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with siponimod.\n【188】 Vaccinations\n【189】 - Test patients for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating siponimod; VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with siponimod.\n【190】 Liver Function Tests\n【191】 - Obtain recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels\n【192】 Maintenance Dosage\n【193】 - After treatment titration  Treatment Initiation), the recommended maintenance dosage of siponimod is 2 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 6. Dosage adjustment is required in patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype.\n【194】 Treatment Initiation\n【195】 - Initiate siponimod with a 5-day titration, as shown in  A starter pack should be used for patients who will be titrated to the 2-mg maintenance dosage\n【196】 - If one titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment needs to be reinitiated with Day 1 of the titration regimen.\n【197】 Maintenance Dosage\n【198】 - In patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype, after treatment titration  Treatment Initiation), the recommended maintenance dosage of siponimod is 1 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 5.\n【199】 Treatment Initiation\n【200】 - Initiate siponimod with a 4-day titration, as shown in  Do not use the starter pack for patients who will be titrated to the 1-mg maintenance dosage.\n【201】 - If one titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment needs to be reinitiated with Day 1 of the titration regimen.\n【202】 ### Monitoring\n【203】 - Because initiation of siponimod treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia , first- or second-degree  AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.\n【204】 First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring\n【205】 - Administer the first dose of siponimod in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.\n【206】 Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring\n【207】 - If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:\n【208】 The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 ppm\n【209】 The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred\n【210】 The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block\n【211】 - The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 ppm\n【212】 - The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred\n【213】 - The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block\n【214】 - If postdose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.\n【215】 - Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with siponimod is considered in patients:\n【216】 With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions\n【217】 With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de points\n【218】 Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction\n【219】 - With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions\n【220】 - With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de points\n【221】 - Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction\n【222】 - After the initial titration is complete, if siponimod treatment is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, reinitiate treatment with Day 1 of the titration regimen;  complete first-dose monitoring in patients for whom it is recommended.\n【223】 # IV Compatibility\n【224】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Siponimod and IV administrations.\n【225】 # Overdosage\n【226】 - In patients with overdosage of siponimod, it is important to observe for signs and symptoms of bradycardia, which may include overnight monitoring. Regular measurements of pulse rate and blood pressure are required, and ECGs should be performed.\n【227】 - There is no specific antidote to siponimod available. Neither dialysis nor plasma exchange would result in meaningful removal of siponimod from the body. The decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by atropine or isoprenaline.\n【228】 # Pharmacology\n【229】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【230】 - Siponimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Siponimod binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. Siponimod blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which siponimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.\n【231】 ## Structure\n【232】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【233】 Immune System\n【234】 - Siponimod induces a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count within 6 hours of the first dose, caused by the reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues.\n【235】 - With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continues to decrease, reaching a nadir median (90% CI) lymphocyte count of approximately 0.560 (0.271-1. cells/nL in a typical CYP2C9*1/*1 or *1/*2, non-Japanese patient, corresponding to 20% to 30% of baseline. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained with chronic daily dosing.\n【236】 - Lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range in 90% of patients within 10 days of stopping therapy. After stopping siponimod treatment, residual lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose.\n【237】 Heart Rate and Rhythm\n【238】 - Siponimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction upon treatment initiation. The maximum decline in heart rate is seen in the first 6 hours post dose. Autonomic responses of the heart, including diurnal variation of heart rate and response to exercise, are not affected by siponimod treatment.\n【239】 - A transient, dose-dependent decrease in heart rate was observed during the initial dosing phase of siponimod, which plateaued at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg, and bradyarrhythmic events (AV blocks and sinus pauses) were detected at a higher incidence under siponimod treatment, compared to placebo.\n【240】 - No second-degree AV blocks of Mobitz type II or higher degree were observed. Most AV blocks and sinus pauses occurred above the recommended dose of 2 mg, with notably higher incidence under non-titrated conditions compared to dose titration conditions.\n【241】 - The decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by atropine or isoprenaline.\n【242】 Beta-Blockers\n【243】 - The negative chronotropic effect of coadministration of siponimod and propranolol was evaluated in a dedicated pharmacodynamics (PD)/safety study. The addition of propranolol on top of siponimod at steady-state had less pronounced negative chronotropic effects (less than additive effect) than the addition of siponimod to propranolol at steady state (additive HR effect)\n【244】 Cardiac Electrophysiology\n【245】 - In a thorough QT study with doses of 2 mg (recommended dose) and 10 mg (five times the recommended dose) siponimod at steady-state, siponimod treatment resulted in a prolongation of QTc , with the maximum mean (upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI) of 7.8 (9. ms at 2 mg dose and 7.2 (9. ms at 10 mg dose. There was an absence of dose- and exposure-response relationship for QTc effects with the 5-fold dose and exposures achieved by the supratherapeutic dose. No subject had absolute QTcF greater than 480 ms or ΔQTcF greater than 60 ms for siponimod treatment.\n【246】 Pulmonary Function\n【247】 - Dose-dependent reductions in absolute forced expiratory volume over 1 second were observed in siponimod-treated patients and were greater than in patients taking placebo.\n【248】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【249】 - Siponimod concentration increases in an apparent dose-proportional manner after multiple once-daily doses of siponimod 0.3 mg to 20 mg. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily dosing, and steady-state levels are approximately 2-3-fold greater than the initial dose. An up-titration regimen is used to reach the clinical therapeutic dose of siponimod of 2 mg after 6 days, and 4 additional days of dosing are required to reach the steady-state-plasma concentrations.\n【250】 Absorption\n【251】 - The time (Tmax) to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after oral administration of immediate release oral dosage forms of siponimod was about 4 hours (range 3-8 hours). Siponimod absorption is extensive (greater than or equal to 70%, based on the amount of radioactivity excreted in urine and the amount of metabolites in feces extrapolated to infinity). The absolute oral bioavailability of siponimod is approximately 84%. After administration of siponimod 2 mg once-daily over 10 days, a mean Cmax of 30.4 ng/mL and mean area under plasma concentration-time curve over dosing interval (AUCtau) of 558 h*ng/mL were observed on day 10. Steady-state was reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily administration of siponimod.\n【252】 Food Effect\n【253】 - Food intake resulted in delayed absorption (the median Tmax increased by approximately 2-3 hours). Food intake had no effect on the systemic exposure of siponimod (Cmax and AUC). Therefore, siponimod may be taken without regard to meals.\n【254】 Distribution\n【255】 - Siponimod distributes to body tissues with a moderate mean volume of distribution of 124 L. Siponimod fraction found in plasma is 68% in humans. Animal studies show that siponimod readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier. Protein binding of siponimod is greater than 99.9% in healthy subjects and in hepatic and renal impaired patients.\n【256】 Elimination\n【257】 Metabolism\n【258】 - Siponimod is extensively metabolized, mainly via CYP2C9 (79.3%), followed by CYP3A4 (18.5%). The pharmacological activity of the main metabolites M3 and M17 is not expected to contribute to the clinical effect and the safety of siponimod in humans.\n【259】 Excretion\n【260】 - An apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of 3.11 L/h was estimated in MS patients. The apparent elimination half-life is approximately 30 hours.\n【261】 - Siponimod is eliminated from the systemic circulation mainly due to metabolism, and subsequent biliary/fecal excretion. Unchanged siponimod was not detected in urine.\n【262】 Specific Populations\n【263】 Male and Female Patients\n【264】 - Gender has no influence on siponimod pharmacokinetics (PK).\n【265】 Racial or Ethnic Groups\n【266】 - The single-dose PK parameters were not different between Japanese and Caucasians healthy subjects, indicating absence of ethnic sensitivity on the PK of siponimod.\n【267】 Patients with Renal Impairment\n【268】 - No dose adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Mean siponimod half-life and Cmax (total and unbound) were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Unbound AUCs were only slightly increased (by 33%), compared to healthy subjects, and it is not expected to be clinically significant. The effects of end-stage renal disease or hemodialysis on the PK of siponimod has not been studied. Due to the high plasma protein binding (greater than 99.9%) of siponimod, hemodialysis is not expected to alter the total and unbound siponimod concentration and no dose adjustments are anticipated based on these considerations.\n【269】 Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n【270】 - No dose adjustments for siponimod are needed in patients with hepatic impairment. The unbound siponimod AUC parameters are 15% and 50% higher in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, in comparison with healthy subjects for the 0.25 mg single dose studied. The increased unbound siponimod AUC in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not expected to be clinically significant. The mean half-life of siponimod was unchanged in hepatic impairment.\n【271】 Drug Interaction Studies\n【272】 Siponimod (and Metabolites M3, M as a Causative Agent of Interaction\n【273】 - In vitro investigations indicated that siponimod and its major systemic metabolites M3 and M17 do not show any clinically relevant drug-drug interaction potential at the therapeutic dose of 2 mg once-daily for all investigated CYP enzymes and transporters.\n【274】 Siponimod as an Object of Interaction\n【275】 - CYP2C9 is polymorphic and the genotype influences the fractional contributions of the two oxidative metabolism pathways to overall elimination. Physiologically based PK modeling indicates a differential CYP2C9 genotype-dependent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 pathways. With decreased CYP2C9 metabolic activity in the respective genotypes, a larger effect of the CYP3A4 perpetrators on siponimod exposure is anticipated.\n【276】 Coadministration of Siponimod with CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n【277】 - The coadministration of fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 dual inhibitor) 200 mg daily at steady-state and a single dose of siponimod 4 mg in CYP2C9*1/*1 healthy volunteers led to a 2-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod. Mean siponimod terminal half-life was increased by 50%. Fluconazole led to a 2- to 4-fold increase in the AUCtau,ss of siponimod across different CYP2C9 genotypes, according to in silica evaluation.\n【278】 Coadministration of siponimod with CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inducers\n【279】 - The coadministration of siponimod 2 mg daily in the presence of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 dual inducer) decreased siponimod AUCtau,ss and Cmax,ss by 57% and 45%, respectively in CY2C9*1/*1 subjects. Rifampin and efavirenz (moderate CYP3A4 inducer) reduced the AUCtau,ss of siponimod by up to 78% and up to 52%, respectively, across CYP2C9 genotypes, according to in silica evaluation.\n【280】 Oral Contraceptives\n【281】 - The effects of coadministration of siponimod 2 mg and 4 mg (twice the recommended dosage) once daily with a monophonic oral contraceptive (OC) containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel were assessed in 24 healthy female subjects (18 to 40 years of age; CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype). There were no clinically relevant effects on the PK or PD of the OC. No interaction studies have been performed with OCs containing other progestagens; however, an effect of siponimod on their exposure is not expected.\n【282】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【283】 Carcinogenesis\n【284】 - Oral carcinogenicity studies of spinomod were conducted in mice and rats. In mice administered siponimod  basis.\n【285】 - In rats, administration of siponimod  at the highest dose tested is approximately 200 times that in humans at the RHD.\n【286】 Mutagenesis\n【287】 - Siponimod was negative in a battery of in vitro (Ames, chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells) and in vivo (micronucleus in mouse and rat) assays.\n【288】 Impairment of Fertility\n【289】 - When siponimod was administered orally  is approximately 100 times the RHD on a mg/m2 basis.\n【290】 - When siponimod was administered orally  at the highest dose tested is approximately 16 times that in humans at the RHD.\n【291】 # Clinical Studies\n【292】 - The efficacy of siponimod was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, time-to-event study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who had evidence of disability progression in the prior 2 years, no evidence of relapse in 3 months prior to study enrollment, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.0-6.5 at study entry (NCT .\n【293】 - Patients were randomized to receive either once daily siponimod 2 mg or placebo, beginning with a dose titration. Evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months during the study, and at the time of a suspected relapse. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and every 12 months.\n【294】 - The primary endpoint of the study was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), defined as at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 5.5 or higher) sustained for 3 months. A prespecified hierarchical analysis consisted of the primary endpoint and 2 secondary endpoints, the time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline on the timed 25-foot walk test and the change from baseline in T2 lesion volume. Additional endpoints included annualized relapse rate (relapses/year) and MRI measures of inflammatory disease activity.\n【295】 - Study duration was variable for individual patients (median study duration was 21 months, range 1 day-37 months).\n【296】 - Study 1 randomized 1651 patients to either siponimod 2 mg (N =  or placebo (N = ; 82% of siponimod-treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the study. Median age was 49.0 years, 95% of patients were white, and 60% female. The median disease duration was 16.0 years, and median EDSS score at baseline was 6.0 (56% of patients had ≥ 6.0 EDSS at baseline); 36% of patients had one or more relapses in the 2 years prior to study entry; 22% of those patients with available imaging had one or more gadolinium-enhancing lesions on their baseline MRI scan; 78% of patients had been previously treated with an MS therapy.\n【297】 - Results are presented in  Siponimod was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of confirmed disability progression, based on a time-to-event analysis (hazard ratio 0.79, p < 0.0134; see ). Siponimod did not significantly delay the time to 20% deterioration in the timed 25-foot walk, compared to placebo. Patients treated with siponimod had a 55% relative reduction in annualized relapse rate, compared to patients on placebo (nominal p-value < 0.. The absolute reduction in the annualized relapse rate was 0.089. Although siponimod had a significant effect on disability progression compared to placebo in patients with active SPMS (e.g., SPMS patients with an MS relapse in the 2 years prior to the study), the effect of siponimod in patients with non-active SPMS was not statistically significant  ).\n【298】 # How Supplied\n【299】 Siponimod film-coated tablets are supplied as follows:\n【300】 - Starter Pack- – blister card of twelve 0.25 mg tablets in a calendarized blister wallet\n【301】 - Bottle of 28 tablets\n【302】 - Bottle of 30 tablets\n【303】 ## Storage\n【304】 Unopened Containers\n【305】 - Store unopened containers of siponimod 0.25 mg and 2 mg film-coated tablets in a refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).\n【306】 Opened Containers:\n【307】 Starter Pack/Blister Card\n【308】 - Siponimod 0.25 mg film-coated tablets in the Starter Pack may be stored at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)  for up to 1 week after opening the blister.

Jugglers and mimes are the simplest examples of the difference in notions.\n【5】 Performance anxiety is  observed in sportsmen. In the latter case it is interpreted as a fear to underperform (in view of the actual public or implied publicity).\n【6】 Quite often stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance, often long time ahead. It has numerous manifestations: fluttering or pounding heart, tremor in hands and legs, diarrhea, facial nerve tics, dry mouth.\n【7】 Stage fright may be observed in ordinary people, beginning artists, as well as in accomplished ones.\n【8】 Some musicians use beta blockers to avoid stage fright during auditions, and performances. In other cases, performers use alcoholic beverages to ease their stage fright. There have been many cases in which this habit has led to alcoholism.\n【9】 # Footnotes\n【10】 \n【11】 id:Demam panggung\n【12】 nl:Plankenkoorts\n【13】 sv:Scenskräck\n", "seq_id": 26232, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#9#13#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-17 22:25:05"}

Methods: An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional. Recommendations: Preendoscopic management: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Endoscopic management: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended, and clips are suggested, for endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk stigmata. Use of TC-325 (hemostatic powder) was suggested as temporizing therapy, but not as sole treatment, in patients with actively bleeding ulcers. Pharmacologic management: The group recommends that patients with bleeding ulcers with high-risk stigmata who have had successful endoscopic therapy receive high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (intravenous loading dose followed by continuous infusion) for 3 days. For these high-risk patients, continued oral PPI therapy is suggested twice daily through 14 days, then once daily for a total duration that depends on the nature of the bleeding lesion. Secondary prophylaxis: The group suggests PPI therapy for patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for cardiovascular prophylaxis.#\n【1】 meeting included up to 20 voting participants for each statement (numbers varied, mainly because of travel difficulties), 2 nonvoting GRADE methodologists, and a nonvoting moderator (J.K.M).\n【2】 The cochairs, other steering committee members, and methodologists generated a list of new and old statements that were presented to the group through an anonymous, Web-based consensus platform (ECD Solutions). Via teleconference, the steering committee members reached consensus on which statements warranted inclusion in the guideline by focusing on priority areas. Using a modified Delphi process , all voting participants modified and finalized the new statements. After reviewing the evidence profiles, the participants anonymously voted on their degree of agreement or disagreement with each statement and submitted comments. Votes were nonbinding and designed to gauge the extent of agreement and the pattern of evidence uncertainty to guide the allotment of time for discussion during the meeting. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) office tabulated the votes and comments and presented the results to the group. Although initially discussed in the form of declarative statements, these were edited into specific PICO questions by the methodologists before the consensus meeting.\n【3】 At a 2-day consensus meeting in May 2018, the group applied the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to move from evidence to recommendations by assessing 7 key criteria: the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, quality (certainty) of the evidence, variability in patients' values and preferences, resource requirements, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility (Supplement Appendix  . Participants voted on the direction of the PICO question (for or against) as yes, uncertain, or no. Consensus for or against a specific strategy was reached if at least 75% of the participants voted yes or no, respectively. For PICO questions on which agreement was reached, the group then discussed the strength of the recommendation (strong vs. conditional) by considering the factors in the Evidence to Decision framework . In cases of low or very low QoE, unless at least 1 of the other 3 factors was overwhelmingly strong, the strength of the recommendation would default (without a vote) to \"conditional\" by using the phrase \"we suggest.\" If the statement warranted a vote and at least 75% of the participants voted \"strong,\" then the recommendation would be designated as strong with the phrase \"we recommend.\"\n【4】 Consensus was not reached on 4 PICO questions (no recommendation A to D), because fewer than 75% of the participants voted either yes or no. No corresponding statements were developed for these questions, but the pertinent evidence and discussions are summarized briefly in the text.\n【5】 # Oversight and Review\n【6】 The guideline process was overseen by the CAG clinical affairs committee to ensure methodological quality and a transparent, nonbiased, evidence-based\n【7】 # CLINICAL GUIDELINE\n【8】 Management of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding decision-making process.

It was reviewed and revised by the steering committee members (E.J.K., J.S., L.L., and M.A.) before dissemination to the full consensus group for feedback.

Trichocereus pachanoi), is a fast-growing columnar cactus native to the Andes of Peru and Ecuador. Known to contain the psychedelic phenethylamine mescaline (lesser than with peyote), it is used mainly as an entheogen, as traditional medicine, and as an ornamental cactus.  It has been used for healing and religious divination in the Andes Mountains region for over 3000 years.  It is sometimes confused with its close relative, the Peruvian Torch cactus.\n【2】 The plant is light to dark green, sometimes glaucous, and having 4-8 (usually 5- ribs.  Groups of 1-4 small, yellow to light brown, spines are located at the nodes which are spaced evenly (approximately 2 cm apart) along the ribs. San Pedro can grow up to 5 meters tall and have multiple branches, usually extending from the base.\n【3】 # Alkaloids\n【4】 San Pedro contains a number of psychoactive alkaloids, including the well-studied chemical mescaline (0.21 - 1.8%), and  3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine, 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, anhalonidine, anhalinine, hordenine, tyramine, and 3-methoxytyramine.\n【5】 Mescaline .\n【6】 Anecdotal evidence suggests that the highest concentrations of active substances are found in the layer of green photosynthetic tissue just beneath the skin. The darker green the cactus, the better the alkaloid content, which can be caused by such ways as growing/ stressing it with reduced sunlight indoors or in shade and/or leaving a cut section indoors for 6+ weeks, water starving, and injections of dopamine or a mixture of tyrosine and dopa over the body.\n【7】 There are various mescaline extraction techniques, simple (boiling in water 5 to 7 hours) and complex (such as an acid-base extraction), the latter technique yielding a material with a significantly higher concentration of mescaline - this is probably the most common source of (black market) mescaline.\n【8】 # Cultivation\n【9】 San Pedro is very easy to grow in most areas.  Because it grows naturally in the high altitude, high rainfall areas of the Andes, it can withstand temperatures far below that of many other cacti.  In fact, its cultivation requirements are really more like 'normal' plants than most other cacti.  San Pedro requires fertile, free-draining soil.  They are susceptible to fungal diseases if over-watered, but are not nearly as sensitive as many other cacti, especially in warm weather.  They can be sunburned and display a yellowing chlorotic reaction to overexposure to sunlight.  In warm areas it is best to keep them out of direct sun in mid-summer.\n【10】 In winter, plants will etiolate, or become thin, due to lower levels of light.  This may be problematic if the etiolated zone is not sufficiently strong to support future growth as the cactus may break in strong winds.  Some people  find it visually undesirable.  If you wish to avoid etiolation when temperatures drop and growth rates slow, encourage it to enter winter dormancy by withholding water and fertilizer from it over the winter.\n【11】 The seeds are quite easy to germinate and grow. Their main requirements consist of high humidity levels, free-draining soil mix, and enough (but not too much) water, light, and nutrition. There are a number of commonly used methods that satisfy these requirements and the choice of a particular method depends mainly on the scale of the cultivation operation.\n【12】 For soil, use coarse sharp sand (sieved river sand).  Some people  find coir or peat, or mixtures, to be effective.  The soil can be sterilized by cooking it in an oven on high for 1-2 hours.  Sterilization will be most effective if the sand is moist. If one is available, an autoclave would  be useful at this point. Some people find sterilization to be unnecessary.  This may depend on other factors.  The soil is placed into trays (which can be sanitized with bleach beforehand if desired) and the seeds planted into it (when the soil has cooled).  The seeds should be only just below the surface (i.e. two or three sand grains over them). The trays now need to be kept in a humid environment.  This may be achieved by the use of plastic bags, glass plates, or greenhouses, depending on scale. ds usually germinate within two weeks to a month, but sometimes come up after several months.\n【13】 The seedlings stay in the humid environment for several months.  During this time they must be continually checked for water and nutrient requirements, and fungal pathogens. Ensure the soil stays moist, but not overly wet. Nutrients can be provided with a liquid fertilizer at 1/8th strength whenever growth rate slows down. Fungi can be killed with a sulfur or copper-based fungicide. There have been some reports of seedlings responding negatively to these treatments so be very cautious with the amount you use. There is some evidence that garlic is  an effective fungicide.\n【14】 If germinating your seeds in cold weather, a heat mat and fluorescent light can be used. These should be set on a timer to mimic normal diurnal temperature cycles for germination but can be left on permanently for faster growth once all the seeds have sprouted. One good method for growing cacti seedlings using this setup is to germinate them in late winter and have them ready to go outside by spring as temperatures and light levels are increasing.\n【15】 # Consumption\n【16】 The most common form of preparation is to cut the cactus into slices, boil it for over 7 hours and juice it into a green liquid preparation that is then drunk during the ceremony which usually happens at night.\n【17】 Another simple and effective method is to start by cutting the pricks out of the cut specimen being used first and then slice it (the darker green the cactus,  the better the alkaloid content, which can be caused by growing/ stressing it with reduced sunlight indoors or in shade and/or leaving a cut section indoors for 6+ weeks) down in between each of it's few columns, deep enough to cut the skin so to peel the tough skin off with tweezers. One can cut the trunk into more sections to make it easier to work around for de-pricking and peeling. Peel the skin from it's tips. Cut off only the darker green, most outer layer of each column that's just under the skin and looks like the tip of a stars' sections shape.  Only use this outer layer of the peeled cactus for consumption as it has the highest alkaloid content. This process may take 2-3+ hours, mainly depending on how quickly the skin is pilled. A way to break up the plant matter more finely, though not too significant of a step depending on the quality of cactus, is to take the chunks before blending them (or using a food processor which is better) and place them in a freezer until frozen. Thaw them out in order to aide in the breaking down of the cactus's cell wall. One should repeat the freezing-thawing process once or twice again, and this will further help turn it into a more fragment like material that's easier to break up by a blender or food processor. Quick absorption in the stomach is the key for enough of the mescaline to build up in the brain at once for a trip, and the more broken up it is the more rapidly it's digested. This is why it's best to take it on an empty stomach, so food doesn't get in the way and stomach acids build up that increase absorption. Place the material, whether it's been through a food processor or not, in a blender (unless the food processor is able to hold all) with lemonade or limeade, mainly for their effect on taste from high levels of citrus acid, and add more lemon or lime juice to help bring the alkaloid pH balance to a more even, acidic level so to neutralize the very bitter alkaloid heavy taste. Other citrus juice containing drinks could work, but those of lemon and lime are arguably the best combination of citrus acid level and common taste. Also, add sugar to help improve the taste. Once the material is as blended as possible, add some ice cubes to form a cold (so the taste is more suspended) slush like drink. Swallowing it is a hard part for most, and this method, aside from chemical extraction and powderizing it into capsules, may be the best for avoiding the problems of ingesting it.  has some other methods for extraction. For cactus quality in general, don't use more than a 12\" x 3\" section of San Pedro with first time experiments, which can be a high dose for even someone well experienced, and use at least a 4\" x 3\" section to perceive threshold effects. One can use a small dose the first time to gauge the potency of the cactus, as it varies dramatically, and then wait at least a few days for a real experiment. Meditation/ prayer before and after ingesting it can help ease the discomfort of potential nausea and anxiety of the bitter, foreign material and improve the trip.\n【18】 Should not be taken by people with a history of liver disorders or hepatitis. Should not be taken by pregnant women due to uterine contraction which can lead to miscarriage. Individuals with a history of cardiovascular problems (heart attack, blood clot, and stroke) or a family history of such problems, and the elderly should avoid consuming due to its vasoconstrictive effects.\n【19】 # Medical Use\n【20】 Echinopsis pachanoi is used to treat nervous conditions, cardiac disease, high blood pressure, and it has unique antimicrobial properties.\n【21】 As mentioned earlier, Echinopsis pachanoi contains hordenine and \". . .it has been shown that hordenine, N, N-Dimethyl-hydroxyphenylethylamine, exhibits an inhibitory action against at least 18 strains of penicillin resistant Staphylococcus bacteria.\"\n【22】 # Legality\n【23】 In the US mescaline was made illegal in 1970 by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act. It was prohibited internationally by the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and is categorized as a Schedule I hallucinogen by the CSA. Mescaline is only legal for certain natives (such as those involved in the Native American Church). \"Mescaline is a controlled substance, U.S. code of Federal Regulations, title 21 part 1308.11.\"  Penalties for manufacture or sale can be as high as five years in jail and a fine of $15,000, with a penalty of up to one year and fine of $5000 for possession.\n【24】 In most countries it is legal to cultivate San Pedro, but in countries where possession of mescaline and related compounds is illegal and highly penalized, cultivation for the purposes of consumption is most likely illegal and  highly penalized. This is the case in the USA, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Germany, and the UK, where it is currently legal to cultivate San Pedro for gardening and ornamental purposes, but not for consumption.\n【25】 It is sold in \"head shops\" in Ireland.\n", "seq_id": 21337, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 23:31:43"}

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include acne, increased weight, nausea, vomiting, headache, migraine, anxiety, depression, mood swings, panic attack, break-through bleeding, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 ### Heading text\n【9】 - Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception.\n【10】 - Oral contraceptives are highly effective. TABLE II lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and Norplant System, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.\n【11】 - In a clinical trial with Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 1,477 subjects had 7,720 cycles of use and a total of 5 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall pregnancy rate of 0.84 per 100 woman-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly. One or more pills were missed during 1,479 (18.8%) of the 7,870 cycles; thus all tablets were taken during 6,391 (81.2%) of the 7,870 cycles. Of the total 7,870 cycles, a total of 150 cycles were excluded from the calculation of the Pearl index due to the use of backup contraception and/or missing 3 or more consecutive pills.\n【12】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【14】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in adult patients.\n【15】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【16】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in adult patients.\n【17】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【18】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【19】 - Safety and efficacy before menarche have not been established.\n【20】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【21】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in pediatric patients.\n【23】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【24】 Emergency contraception - Postcoital contraception\n【25】 - For emergency contraception, one tablet of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (Plan B(R)) should be taken orally as soon as possible within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. The second tablet of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg should be taken 12 hours after the first dose. Patients should contact their physician to discuss repeating the dose if vomiting occurs within 1 hour of taking either the first or second dose. The product can be used at any time during the menstrual cycle. For women younger than 17 years, levonorgestrel oral tablets (Plan B(R)) are available as a prescription-only product for emergency contraception.\n【26】 - For emergency contraception, one tablet of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (Plan B(R) One-Step) should be taken orally as soon as possible within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse.\n【27】 # Contraindications\n【28】 Combination oral contraceptives should not be used in women with any of the following conditions:\n【29】 - Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders\n【30】 - A history of deep-vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders\n【31】 - Cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease (current or past history)\n【32】 - Valvular heart disease with thrombogenic complications\n【33】 - Thrombogenic rhythm disorders\n【34】 - Hereditary or acquired thrombophilias\n【35】 - Major surgery with prolonged immobilization\n【36】 - Diabetes with vascular involvement\n【37】 - Headaches with focal neurological symptoms\n【38】 - Uncontrolled hypertension\n【39】 - Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer\n【40】 - Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia\n【41】 - Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\n【42】 - Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use\n【43】 - Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas, or active liver disease\n【44】 - Known or suspected pregnancy\n【45】 - Hypersensitivity to any of the components of Aviane\n【46】 # Warnings\n【47】 The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events (such as myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and stroke), hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity, diabetes, and surgery or trauma with increased risk of thrombosis  CONTRAINDICATIONS).\n【48】 Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.\n【49】 The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.\n【50】 - Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population. For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.\n【51】 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems\n【52】 a. Myocardial Infarction\n【53】 - An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six. The risk is very low under the age of 30.\n【54】 - Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and nonsmokers over the age of 40  among women who use oral contraceptives.\n【55】 - Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age, and obesity. In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users  section 9 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n【56】 b. Venous Thrombosis and Thromboembolism\n【57】 - An increased risk of venous thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to nonusers to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease. Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization. The approximate incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (< 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10,000 woman-years compared to 0.5 to 3 per 10,000 woman-years for nonusers. However, the incidence is less than that associated with pregnancy (6 per 10,000 woman-years). The excess risk is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. Venous thromboembolism may be fatal. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and gradually disappears after pill use is stopped.\n【58】 - A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is  associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination.\n【59】 c. Cerebrovascular Diseases\n【60】 - Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who  smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.\n【61】 - In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is  greater in older women. Oral contraceptives  increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms, see CONTRAINDICATIONS) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.\n【62】 d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives\n【63】 - A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.\n【64】 - Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.\n【65】 e. Persistence of Risk of Vascular Disease\n【66】 - There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.\n【67】 - In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small. However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogens.\n【68】 Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use\n【69】 - One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (TABLE III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's — but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.\n【70】 - Because of these changes in practice and, , because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.\n【71】 - Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.\n【72】 Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts\n【73】 - Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the association between the use of oral contraceptives and the incidence of breast and cervical cancer.\n【74】 - The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combination oral contraceptives. However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after combination oral contraceptive discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have reported a small increase in risk for women who first use combination oral contraceptives at a younger age. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with combination oral contraceptive use regardless of a woman's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.\n【75】 - Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous OC users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers.\n【76】 - Women with known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor.\n【77】 - Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer in some populations of women. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.\n【78】 - In spite of many studies of the relationship between combination oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.\n【79】 Hepatic Neoplasia\n【80】 - Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of these benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use. Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n【81】 - Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.\n【82】 Ocular Lesions\n【83】 - There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives that may lead to partial or complete loss of vision. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.\n【84】 Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy\n【85】 - Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies  do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy  CONTRAINDICATIONSsection).\n【86】 - The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.\n【87】 - It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.\n【88】 Gallbladder Disease\n【89】 - Combination oral contraceptives may worsen existing gallbladder disease and may accelerate the development of this disease in previously asymptomatic women. Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens. More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal. The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.\n【90】 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects\n【91】 - Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance. Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents. However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.\n【92】 - A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier  WARNINGS, 1a. and 1d.; PRECAUTIONS, , changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.\n【93】 Elevated Blood Pressure\n【94】 - An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users and with continued use. Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.\n【95】 - Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued  CONTRAINDICATIONSsection). For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.\n【96】 Headache\n【97】 - The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause  WARNINGS, 1c. and CONTRAINDICATIONS).\n【98】 Bleeding Irregularities\n【99】 - Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. The type and dose of progestogen may be important. If bleeding persists or recurs, nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.\n【100】 - Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (possibly with anovulation), especially when such a condition was preexistent.\n【101】 Ectopic Pregnancy\n【102】 - Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.\n【103】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n【104】 General\n【105】 - Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.\n【106】 Physical Examination and Follow-Up\n【107】 - A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.\n【108】 Lipid Disorders\n【109】 - Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult  WARNINGS, 1a., 1d., and .\n【110】 - A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while taking oral contraceptives. Nonhormonal contraception should be considered in women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia may occur in a small population of combination oral contraceptive users. Elevations of plasma triglycerides may lead to pancreatitis and other complications.\n【111】 Liver Function\n【112】 - If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.\n【113】 Fluid Retention\n【114】 - Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.\n【115】 Emotional Disorders\n【116】 - Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related. Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.\n【117】 Contact Lenses\n【118】 - Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.\n【119】 Gastrointestinal\n【120】 - Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations.\n【121】 Drug Interactions\n【122】 - Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products\n【123】 - Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a backup nonhormonal method of birth control should be considered.\n【124】 - Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results.\n【125】 - Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.\n【126】 - Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P  and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may  result in breakthrough bleeding.\n【127】 Increase in Plasma Levels Associated with Coadministered Drugs\n【128】 - Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen increase the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol since these drugs act as competitive inhibitors for sulfation of ethinyl estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall, a known pathway of elimination for ethinyl estradiol. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and troleandomycin may increase plasma hormone levels. Troleandomycin may  increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives.\n【129】 Changes in Plasma Levels of Coadministered Drugs\n【130】 - Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone and other corticosteroids, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation (particularly glucuronidation), have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.\n【131】 - The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions.\n【132】 Interactions with Laboratory Tests\n【133】 - Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:\n【134】 - Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.\n【135】 - Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.\n【136】 - Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulins (SHBG) leading to increased levels of total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids respectively. Free or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged.\n【137】 - Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.\n【138】 - Glucose tolerance may be decreased.\n【139】 - Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.\n【140】 Carcinogenesis\n【141】 WARNINGS  section.\n【142】 Pregnancy\n【143】 Teratogenic Effects:\n【144】 - Pregnancy Category X\n【145】 Nursing Mothers\n【146】 - Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combination oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.\n【147】 Pediatric Use\n【148】 - Safety and efficacy of Aviane tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of Aviane before menarche is not indicated.\n【149】 Geriatric Use\n【150】 - Aviane has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.\n【151】 Information for the Patient\n【152】 Patient Labeling printed below.\n【153】 # Adverse Reactions\n【154】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【155】 - An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions  WARNINGS section for additional information) has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives:\n【156】 - Thromboembolic and thrombotic disorders and other vascular problems (including thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, mesenteric thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis), carcinoma of the reproductive organs and breasts, hepatic neoplasia (including hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors), ocular lesions (including retinal vascular thrombosis), gallbladder disease, carbohydrate and lipid effects, elevated blood pressure, and headache including migraine.\n【157】 - The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug related (alphabetically listed):\n【158】 - Acne\n【159】 - Amenorrhea\n【160】 - Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms\n【161】 - Breast changes: tenderness, pain, enlargement, secretion\n【162】 - Budd-Chiari syndrome\n【163】 - Cervical erosion and secretion, change in\n【164】 - Cholestatic jaundice\n【165】 - Chorea, exacerbation of\n【166】 - Colitis\n【167】 - Contact lenses, intolerance to\n【168】 - Corneal curvature (steepening), change in\n【169】 - Dizziness\n【170】 - Edema/fluid retention\n【171】 - Erythema multiforme\n【172】 - Erythema nodosum\n【173】 - Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cramps, and bloating)\n【174】 - Hirsutism\n【175】 - Infertility after discontinuation of treatment, temporary\n【176】 - Lactation, diminution in, when given immediately postpartum\n【177】 - Libido, change in\n【178】 - Melasma/chloasma which may persist\n【179】 - Menstrual flow, change in\n【180】 - Mood changes, including depression\n【181】 - Nausea\n【182】 - Nervousness\n【183】 - Pancreatitis\n【184】 - Porphyria, exacerbation of\n【185】 - Rash (allergic)\n【186】 - Scalp hair, loss of\n【187】 - Serum folate levels, decrease in\n【188】 - Spotting\n【189】 - Systemic lupus erythematosus, exacerbation of\n【190】 - Unscheduled bleeding\n【191】 - Vaginitis, including candidiasis\n【192】 - Varicose veins, aggravation of\n【193】 - Vomiting\n【194】 - Weight or appetite (increase or decrease), change in\n【195】 - The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives:\n【196】 - Cataracts\n【197】 - Cystitis-like syndrome\n【198】 - Dysmenorrhea\n【199】 - Hemolytic uremic syndrome\n【200】 - Hemorrhagic eruption\n【201】 - Optic neuritis, which may lead to partial or complete loss of vision\n【202】 - Premenstrual syndrome\n【203】 - Renal function, impaired\n【204】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【205】 There is limited information regarding Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【206】 # Drug Interactions\n【207】 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products\n【208】 - Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a backup nonhormonal method of birth control should be considered.\n【209】 - Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results.\n【210】 - Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.\n【211】 - Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P  and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may  result in breakthrough bleeding.\n【212】 Increase in Plasma Levels Associated with Coadministered Drugs\n【213】 - Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen increase the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol since these drugs act as competitive inhibitors for sulfation of ethinyl estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall, a known pathway of elimination for ethinyl estradiol.

This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.\n【225】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【226】 ### Pregnancy\n【227】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): X\n【228】 Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy\n【229】 - Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies  do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy  CONTRAINDICATIONSsection).\n【230】 - The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.\n【231】 - It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.\n【232】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【233】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in women who are pregnant.\n【234】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【235】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol during labor and delivery.\n【236】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【237】 - Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combination oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.\n【238】 ### Pediatric Use\n【239】 - Safety and efficacy of Aviane tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of Aviane before menarche is not indicated.\n【240】 ### Geriatic Use\n【241】 - Aviane has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.\n【242】 ### Gender\n【243】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol with respect to specific gender populations.\n【244】 ### Race\n【245】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol with respect to specific racial populations.\n【246】 ### Renal Impairment\n【247】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in patients with renal impairment.\n【248】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【249】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【250】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【251】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【252】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【253】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【254】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【255】 ### Administration\n【256】 - To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. The dosage of Aviane - 28 is one orange tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light-green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to the prescribed schedule. It is recommended that Aviane - 28 tablets be taken at the same time each day.\n【257】 - The dispenser should be kept in the wallet supplied to avoid possible fading of the pills. If the pills fade, patients should continue to take them as directed.\n【258】 During The First Cycle Of Use\n【259】 - The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. The patient should be instructed to begin taking Aviane on either the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation (Sunday Start) or on Day 1 of menstruation (Day 1 Start).\n【260】 Sunday Start\n【261】 - The patient is instructed to begin taking Aviane - 28 on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first tablet (orange) is taken that day. One orange tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light-green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within 3 days following discontinuation of orange tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started. During the first cycle, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Aviane - 28 until an orange tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days, and a nonhormonal backup method of birth control should be used during those 7 days.\n【262】 Day 1 Start\n【263】 - During the first cycle of medication, the patient is instructed to begin taking Aviane - 28 during the first 24 hours of her period (day one of her menstrual cycle). One orange tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light-green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within 3 days following discontinuation of orange tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started. If medication is begun on day one of the menstrual cycle, no backup contraception is necessary. If Aviane - 28 tablets are started later than day one of the first menstrual cycle or postpartum, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Aviane - 28 tablets until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration, and a nonhormonal backup method of birth control should be used during those 7 days.\n【264】 After the First Cycle of Use\n【265】 - The patient begins her next and all subsequent courses of tablets on the day after taking her last light-green tablet. She should follow the same dosing schedule: 21 days on orange tablets followed by 7 days on light-green tablets. If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a nonhormonal backup method of birth control until she has taken an orange tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.\n【266】 Switching from Another Hormonal Method of Contraception\n【267】 - When the patient is switching from a 21 day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Aviane. She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21 day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28 day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Aviane on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Aviane the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Aviane on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal backup method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet taking.\n【268】 If Spotting or Breakthrough Bleeding Occurs\n【269】 - If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician.\n【270】 Risk of Pregnancy if Tablets are Missed\n【271】 - While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled orange tablets are missed. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is unlikely if Aviane is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.\n【272】 - The risk of pregnancy increases with each active (orange) tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING below.\n【273】 Use After Pregnancy, Abortion or Miscarriage\n【274】 - Aviane may be initiated no earlier than day 28 postpartum in the nonlactating mother or after a second trimester abortion due to the increased risk for thromboembolism  CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS  concerning thromboembolic disease). The patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal backup method for the first 7 days of tablet taking.\n【275】 - Aviane may be initiated immediately after a first trimester abortion or miscarriage. If the patient starts Aviane immediately, backup contraception is not needed.\n【276】 ### Monitoring\n【277】 - If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued.\n【278】 - Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.\n【279】 - Oral contraceptives should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.\n【280】 # IV Compatibility\n【281】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol and IV administrations.\n【282】 # Overdosage\n【283】 - Symptoms of oral contraceptive overdosage in adults and children may include nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness/fatigue; withdrawal bleeding may occur in females. There is no specific antidote and further treatment of overdose, if necessary, is directed to the symptoms.\n【284】 # Pharmacology\n【285】 There is limited information regarding Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol Pharmacology in the drug label.\n【286】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【287】 - Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).\n【288】 ## Structure\n【289】 - 21 orange active tablets each containing 0.10 mg of levonorgestrel, USP (-)-13-Ethyl-17-hydroxy-18,19-dinor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, a totally synthetic progestogen, and 0.02 mg of ethinyl estradiol, USP, (19-Nor-17a-pregna-1,3,5-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). The inactive ingredients present are: FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized corn starch, sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide.\n【290】 - 7 light-green, inert tablets each containing: D&C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake, FD&C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized corn starch.\n【291】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【292】 There is limited information regarding Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n【293】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【294】 Absorption\n【295】 - No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of Aviane  in humans has been conducted. However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability about 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is between 38% and 48%.\n【296】 - After a single dose of Aviane to 22 women under fasting conditions, maximum serum concentrations of levonorgestrel are 2.8 ± 0.9 ng/mL (mean ± SD) at 1.6 ± 0.9 hours. At steady state, attained from day 19 onwards, maximum levonorgestrel concentrations of 6 ± 2.7 ng/mL are reached at 1.5 ± 0.5 hours after the daily dose. The minimum serum levels of levonorgestrel at steady state are 1.9 ± 1 ng/mL. Observed levonorgestrel concentrations increased from day 1 (single dose) to days 6 and 21 (multiple doses) by 34% and 96%, respectively . Unbound levonorgestrel concentrations increased from day 1 to days 6 and 21 by 25% and 83%, respectively. The kinetics of total levonorgestrel are nonlinear due to an increase in binding of levonorgestrel to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is attributed to increased SHBG levels that are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol.\n【297】 - Following a single dose, maximum serum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol of 62 ± 21 pg/mL are reached at 1.5 ± 0.5 hours. At steady state, attained from at least day 6 onwards, maximum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol were 77 ± 30 pg/mL and were reached at 1.3 ± 0.7 hours after the daily dose. The minimum serum levels of ethinyl estradiol at steady state are 10.5 ± 5.1 pg/mL. Ethinyl estradiol concentrations did not increase from days 1 to 6, but did increase by 19% from days 1 to 21 .\n【298】 Distribution\n【299】 - Levonorgestrel in serum is primarily bound to SHBG. Ethinyl estradiol is about 97% bound to plasma albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis.\n【300】 Metabolism\n【301】 Levonorgestrel:\n【302】 - The most important metabolic pathway occurs in the reduction of the Δ4-3-oxo group and hydroxylation at positions 2α, 1β, and 16β, followed by conjugation. Most of the metabolites that circulate in the blood are sulfates of 3α,5β-tetrahydro-levonorgestrel, while excretion occurs predominantly in the form of glucuronides. Some of the parent levonorgestrel  circulates as 17β-sulfate. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.\n【303】 Ethinyl Estradiol:\n【304】 - Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A in the liver are responsible for the 2-hydroxylation that is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Levels of Cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol 2-hydroxylation. Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and undergoes enterohepatic circulation.\n【305】 Excretion\n【306】 - The elimination half-life for levonorgestrel is approximately 36 ± 13 hours at steady state. Levonorgestrel and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine (40% to 68%) and about 16% to 48% are excreted in feces. The elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol is 18 ± 4.7 hours at steady state.\n【307】 Special Populations\n【308】 Race:\n【309】 - Based on the pharmacokinetic study with Aviane, there are no apparent differences in pharmacokinetic parameters among women of different races.\n【310】 Hepatic Insufficiency:\n【311】 - No formal studies have evaluated the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Aviane. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.\n【312】 Renal Insufficiency:\n【313】 - No formal studies have evaluated the effect of renal disease on the disposition of Aviane.\n【314】 Drug-Drug Interactions:\n【315】 -  PRECAUTIONS section - Drug Interactions\n【316】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【317】 There is limited information regarding Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n【318】 # Clinical Studies\n【319】 There is limited information regarding Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n【320】 # How Supplied\n【321】 - Aviane (0.10 mg levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is available as 28 tablets packaged in cartons of six blister card dispensers. Each blister card dispenser contains 21 orange active tablets and 7 light-green inert tablets. Each orange tablet is round, film coated and debossed with dp on one side and 016 on the other side. Each light-green tablet is round and debossed with dp on one side and 519 on the other side.\n【322】 ## Storage\n【323】 - Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) .\n【324】 - KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.\n【325】 - REFERENCES AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.\n【326】 # Images\n【327】 ## Drug Images\n【328】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【329】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【330】 BRIEF SUMMARY PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT\n【331】 - This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.\n【332】 - Oral contraceptives,  known as “birth control pills” or “the pill,” are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used without missing any pills. The average failure rate of large numbers of pill users is approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are  free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.\n【333】 - For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability or death. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:\n【334】 - smoke\n【335】 - have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or a tendency to form blood clots\n【336】 - have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice, malignant or benign liver tumors, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization\n【337】 - have headaches with neurological symptoms\n【338】 - You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.\n【339】 - Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, nonsmoking women, there are  greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.\n【340】 - Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common such effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.\n【341】 - The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and do not smoke. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:\n【342】 - Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis) and lungs (pulmonary embolism), blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack and angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. Women with migraine  may be at increased risk of stroke with pill use.\n【343】 - Liver tumors, which may rupture and cause severe bleeding. A possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancer. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.\n【344】 - High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.\n【345】 - The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics, herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and HIV/AIDS drugs may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.\n【346】 - Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use.\n【347】 - Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly if you started using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age.\n【348】 - After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go down and disappear 10 years after stopping use of the pill. It is not known whether this slightly increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is caused by the pill. It may be that women taking the pill were examined more often, so that breast cancer was more likely to be detected.\n【349】 - You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare provider and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.\n【350】 - Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.\n【351】 - Taking the pill provides some important noncontraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.\n【352】 - Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare provider.\n【353】 ### DETAILED PATIENT LABELING\n【354】 - This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.\n【355】 INTRODUCTION\n【356】 - Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the “birth control pill” or “the pill”) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will  help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should  follow your healthcare provider's advice with regard to regular checkups while you are on the pill.\n【357】 EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\n【358】 - Oral contraceptives or “birth control pills” or “the pill” are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other nonsurgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates are approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during each 28 day cycle of use.\n【359】 - In comparison, average failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:\n【360】 WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\n【361】 - Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you have any of the following conditions:\n【362】 - History of heart attack or stroke\n【363】 - Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes\n【364】 - A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs\n【365】 - Chest pain (angina pectoris)\n【366】 - Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina, or certain hormonally-sensitive cancers\n【367】 - Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your healthcare provider)\n【368】 - Liver tumor (benign or cancerous) or active liver disease\n【369】 - Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill\n【370】 - Known or suspected pregnancy\n【371】 - A need for surgery with prolonged bed rest\n【372】 - Heart valve or heart rhythm disorders that may be associated with formation of blood clots\n【373】 - Diabetes affecting your circulation\n【374】 - Headaches with neurological symptoms\n【375】 - Uncontrolled high blood pressure\n【376】 - Allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets)\n【377】 - Tell your healthcare provider if you have had any of these conditions. Your healthcare provider can recommend another method of birth control.\n【378】 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\n【379】 - Tell your healthcare provider if you or any family member has ever had:\n【380】 - Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast X-ray or mammogram\n【381】 - Diabetes\n【382】 - Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides\n【383】 - High blood pressure\n【384】 - A tendency to form blood clots\n【385】 - Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy\n【386】 - Depression\n【387】 - Gallbladder, liver, heart, or kidney disease\n【388】 - History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods\n【389】 - Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare provider if they choose to use oral contraceptives. Also, be sure to inform your healthcare provider if you smoke or are on any medications.\n【390】 - Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use in healthy, nonsmoking women over 40 (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are  greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.\n【391】 RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\n【392】 Risks of Developing Blood Clots\n【393】 - Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.\n【394】 - Users of combination oral contraceptives have a higher risk of developing blood clots compared to nonusers. This risk is highest during the first year of combination oral contraceptive use.\n【395】 - If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare provider about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should  not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill   the section While Breastfeeding  in GENERALPRECAUTIONS).\n【396】 - The risk of blood clots is greater in users of combination oral contraceptives compared to nonusers. This risk may be higher in users of high-dose pills (those containing 50 mcg or more of estrogen) and may  be greater with longer use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping combination oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of combination oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages.\n【397】 - The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives  increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples inclu\n【398】 - Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should talk to your healthcare professional before taking combination oral contraceptives.\n【399】 Heart Attacks and Strokes\n【400】 - Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes or transient ischemic attacks (blockage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.\n【401】 - Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.\n【402】 - Women with migraine (especially migraine/headache with neurological symptoms) who take oral contraceptives  may be at higher risk of stroke and must not use combination oral contraceptives  section WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES).\n【403】 Gallbladder Disease\n【404】 - Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having gallbladder disease, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens. Oral contraceptives may worsen existing gallbladder disease or accelerate the development of gallbladder disease in women previously without symptoms.\n【405】 Liver Tumors\n【406】 - In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, a possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancers in two studies in which a few women who developed these very rare cancers were found to have used oral contraceptives for long periods. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.\n【407】 Cancer of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts\n【408】 - Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use.\n【409】 - Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly if you started using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age.\n【410】 - After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go down and disappear 10 years after stopping use of the pill. It is not known whether this slightly increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is caused by the pill. It may be that women taking the pill were examined more often, so that breast cancer was more likely to be detected.\n【411】 - You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare provider and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.\n【412】 - Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.\n【413】 Lipid Metabolism and Pancreatitis\n【414】 - There have been reports of increases of blood cholesterol and triglycerides in users of combination oral contraceptives. Increases in triglycerides have led to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in some cases.\n【415】 ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD  PREGNANCY\n【416】 - All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to disability or death. An estimate of the number of deaths associated with different methods of birth control and pregnancy has been calculated and is shown in the following table.\n【417】 - In the above table, the risk of death from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7 to 26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, except for those women over the age of 40, when the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.\n【418】 - The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, nonsmoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. Older women, as all women, who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with the individual patient needs.\n【419】 WARNING SIGNALS\n【420】 - If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your healthcare provider immediately:\n【421】 - Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung)\n【422】 - Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg)\n【423】 - Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack)\n【424】 - Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke)\n【425】 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)\n【426】 - Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your healthcare provider to show you how to examine your breasts)\n【427】 - Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)\n【428】 - Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)\n【429】 - Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark-colored urine, or light-colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems)\n【430】 SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\n【431】 - Unscheduled or Breakthrough Vaginal Bleeding or Spotting:\n【432】 - Unscheduled vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may  occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your healthcare provider.\n【433】 - Contact Lenses:\n【434】 - If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your healthcare provider.\n【435】 - Fluid Retention:\n【436】 - Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your healthcare provider.\n【437】 - Melasma:\n【438】 - A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.\n【439】 - Other Side Effects:\n【440】 - Other side effects may include nausea, breast tenderness, change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, vaginal infections, inflammation of the pancreas, and allergic reactions.\n【441】 - If any of these side effects bother you, call your healthcare provider.\n【442】 GENERAL PRECAUTIONS\n【443】 Missed Periods and Use of Oral Contraceptives Before or During Early Pregnancy\n【444】 - There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Stop taking oral contraceptives if you are pregnant.\n【445】 - There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your healthcare provider about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.\n【446】 While Breastfeeding\n【447】 - If you are breastfeeding, consult your healthcare provider before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.\n【448】 Laboratory Tests\n【449】 - If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills.\n【450】 Drug Interactions\n【451】 - Certain drugs may interact with birth control pills to make them less effective in preventing pregnancy or cause an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Such drugs include rifampin, drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital) and phenytoin (Dilantin is one brand of this drug), primidone (Mysoline), topiramate (Topamax), carbamazepine (Tegretol is one brand of this drug), phenylbutazone (Butazolidin is one brand), some drugs used for HIV or AIDS such as ritonavir (Norvir), modafinil (Provigil) and possibly certain antibiotics (such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines), and herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).

Biotin, sometimes called vitamin H, is an important water-soluble vitamin that aids in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins.  Biotin Deficiency can result in behavioral disorders, lack of coordination, learning disabilities and seizure. Doses of synthetic Biotin can alleviate and sometimes totally arrest such symptoms.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 # Classification\n【5】 # Pathophysiology\n【6】 # Causes\n【7】 ## Genetics\n【8】 Mutations in the BTD gene cause biotinidase deficiency. Biotinidase is the enzyme that is made by the BTD gene. Many mutations that cause the enzyme to be nonfunctional or to be made at extremely low levels have been identified. Biotin is a vitamin that is chemically bound to proteins. (Most vitamins are only loosely associated with proteins.) Without biotinidase activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot be used by the body. Another function of the biotinidase enzyme is to recycle biotin from enzymes that are important in metabolism (processing of substances in cells). When biotin is lacking, specific enzymes called carboxylases cannot process proteins, fats, or carbohydrates. Individuals lacking biotinidase activity can still have normal carboxylases if they ingest small amounts of biotin.\n【9】 This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.\n【10】 # Differentiating Biotinidase deficiency from Other Diseases\n【11】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【12】 Approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns are affected by profound (less than 10 percent of normal enzyme activity) or partial (10-30 percent of normal enzyme activity) biotinidase deficiency.\n【13】 # Risk Factors\n【14】 # Screening\n【15】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【16】 ## Natural History\n【17】 ## Complications\n【18】 ## Prognosis\n【19】 # Diagnosis\n【20】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\n【21】 ## History and Symptoms\n【22】 ## Physical Examination\n【23】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【24】 ## Imaging Findings\n【25】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n【26】 # Treatment\n【27】 ## Medical Therapy\n【28】 ## Surgery\n【29】 ## Prevention\n", "seq_id": 14469, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#7#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#13#29#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-17 22:26:51"}

Staphylococcus aureus could form abscess by secretion of several killing agents like enzymes and toxins. In a reaction to these bacterial substances, assembled white blood cells in this tissue produces anti-bacterial anti-bodies that help in killing the bacteria. However, these cells cause damage to the soft tissue contributing in the abscess formation.\n【12】 As the breast abscess is the complicated form of mastitis, the pathophysiology is mostly like the mastitis pathophysiology.\n【13】 ## Pathogenesis\n【14】 Breast abscess is the result of underlying inflammation (mastitis) in the breast skin. Injury may happen either during the lactation process from the infant or in the non-lactaion state of the patient as a cracking in the breast skin. This injury accelerates the entry of the causative bacteria which by its role form the abscess. In neglected cases, there may be necrosis in the abscess location leads to fibrosis, scarring and nipple retraction.\n【15】 - Lactational:\n【16】 Injured breast skin allows the entrance of the bacteria to the mammillary ducts. This bacteria can be from the infant or the mother herself. Overproduction of the breast milk with no flow to the infant forms an opportunistic field for the bacteria to cause infection.\n【17】 Breast Duct Ectasia: metaplastic change of the duct cells can cause duct ectasia. This change causes widening of the ducts lining which leads to thickening of the ducts and obstruction. The ducts become filled with fluid which leads to nipple discharge and infection by the entrance of the bacteria and can form pus and abscess as a final result.\n【18】 - Injured breast skin allows the entrance of the bacteria to the mammillary ducts.

It can be subgrouped into central, peripheral and skin associating.\n【22】 Cracking in the skin will overtly help the bacteria to enter and form the abscess.\n【23】 - Non lactational breast abscess is less common than lactational form. It can be subgrouped into central, peripheral and skin associating.\n【24】 - Cracking in the skin will overtly help the bacteria to enter and form the abscess.\n【25】 ## Associated Diseases\n【26】 There is no associated diseases with breast abscess.\n【27】 # Causes\n【28】 Breast abscess is a bacterial infectious disease that is caused by many bacterial pathogens and it may  be caused by fungi mostly common candida through the infant mouth. It is almost caused by the same pathogens causing mastitis. To understand the common species causing breast abscess we can classify them into gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria.\n【29】 # Differentiating Breast abscess from other Diseases\n【30】 Breast abscess should be differentiated from other diseases that cause swelling in the breast skin. These diseases are like mastitis, inflammatory breast cancer, galactocele, plugged duct, Mondor's syndrome and fibroadenoma.\n【31】 Other differential diagnosis of breast abscess can inclu\n【32】 - Cystosarcoma phyllodes\n【33】 - Breast cyst\n【34】 - Breast carcinoma\n【35】 - Lymphangioma\n【36】 - Hemangioma\n【37】 - Lipoma\n【38】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【39】 Breast abscess is a rare disease that may occur due to improper treatment of the mastitis. There is no significant prevalence concerning the abscess.\n【40】 ## Incidence\n【41】 - The incidence of breast abscess is 3,000-11,000 per 100,000 of patients with mastitis.\n【42】 - The incidence of breast abscess is only 100-3,000 per 100,000 of the puerperal patients.\n【43】 ## Age\n【44】 - Patients of all age groups may develop breast abscess.\n【45】 - Breast abscess is more common observed in the infants and the young more than the elder.\n【46】 - It is common in neonates with mastitis as approximately 50 percent of the neonatal patients with mastitis can develop breast abscess.\n【47】 ## Gender\n【48】 Breast abscess occurs commonly in women. It is very rare to be developed in men.\n【49】 ## Race\n【50】 Breast abscess is more prevalent in the african american race.\n【51】 # Risk Factors\n【52】 ## More common risk factors\n【53】 - The most important risk factor of breast abscess is trauma.Trauma increases the possibility of the abscess formation as it facilitates the entrance of the causative bacteria into the soft tissue. Trauma can take place by different ways like shaving subareolar hair, piercing of nipple, infant's mouth during breastfeeding and picking acne lesions.\n【54】 - Smoking: increases the chances of abscess recurrence.\n【55】 - Obesity\n【56】 - Diabetes mellitus\n【57】 - Duct ectasia of the breast.\n【58】 - Local skin infection\n【59】 ## Less common risk factors\n【60】 These risk factors are related more to the non-lactational breast abscess.\n【61】 - Insect bites\n【62】 - Increasing age\n【63】 - Surgical treatment: increases recurrence rate of the abscess.\n【64】 # Natural history, complications and prognosis\n【65】 ## Natural History\n【66】 There is no significant natural history regarding the breast abscess. However, the abscess generally if not treated it will burst around its site or necrosis will take place.\n【67】 ## Complications\n【68】 Complications that can develop in cases of breast abscess are:\n【69】 - Inflammatory breast cancer\n【70】 - Milk fistula\n【71】 - Antibioma\n【72】 ## Prognosis\n【73】 Breast abscess prognosis is good with treatment but it has a high recurrence rate. In non lactational abscess has a high chance of recurrence (more than 50% of the cases).. In the lactational abscess the chance of recurrence is around 35-50% of the cases.\n【74】 # Diagnosis\n【75】 ## History and Symptoms\n【76】 Breast abscess can be noticed first by the patient like a breast mass or lump. The patient usually has current breast infection(mastitis) or history of the infection.\n【77】 In order to get precise diagnosis of breast abscess, these items should be put in consideration:\n【78】 - Local painful breast lump\n【79】 - History of mastitis\n【80】 - Nipple discharge\n【81】 - Risk factors of the breast abscess like trauma, duct ectasia or insect bites.\n【82】 - If lactating patient: breast-feeding history\n【83】 - If non-lactating history: diabetic history\n【84】 ### Most common symptoms\n【85】 Breast abscess has a typical abscess symptoms which are:\n【86】 - Fever and fatigue\n【87】 - Redness\n【88】 - Warmth\n【89】 - localized swelling\n【90】 - Breast skin induration\n【91】 ### Less common symptoms\n【92】 - Nipple discharge\n【93】 - Fistula\n【94】 - Mass in the breast\n【95】 ## Physical examination\n【96】 Patients with breast abscess are remarkable for the breast tenderness, swelling, redness and warmth of the skin.\n【97】 ## Laboratory findings\n【98】 Breast abscess diagnosis depends only on the clinical manifestations of the abscess not the laboratory findings. However, a culture could be taken from the milk and the pus just to decide the antibiotics needed for the treatment.\n【99】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【100】 There is no significant changes in the EKG of breast abscess patients.\n【101】 ## Chest X ray\n【102】 There is no x-ray changes in the chest of breast abscess patients.\n【103】 ## CT Scan\n【104】 CT scan is not used to diagnose the breast abscess. However, it can be performed to exclude other diseases like breast cancer.\n【105】 ## Ultrasound\n【106】 - Ultrasonography is an important imaging approach for diagnosis of the breast abscess. It is mainly used to differentiate between the different diseases causing breast lumps. It is  used in abscess needle aspiration guiding.\n【107】 - Breast abscess on chest ultrasonography appears like medium sized collections with not well defined margins and may have some areas with increased density.\n【108】 - There is no vascularity in the US image.\n【109】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n【110】 Mammography is not indicated to be used in diagnosis of the breast abscess. However, it is strongly recommended in these cases to be used to differentiate between the breast abscess and other breast diseases and cancer.\n【111】 # Treatment\n【112】 Breast abscess treatment regimen includes both abscess drainage (surgically and by aspiration) and antibiotic medical therapy.It is treated mainly surgically through abscess drainage and suction.The patient should be referred immediately to the breast surgeon to start the abscess drainage.\n【113】 ## Medical therapy\n【114】 Medical treatment is important alongside the surgical treatment.Breast abscess is treated with antibiotic medical therapy as a supportive line to the surgical measures and to prevent the abscess recurrance. The choice of the antibiotic medications depends on the pathogen type however, the high possibility of the pathogen to be staphylococcus aureus leads to start the antibiotic medications before the result of the discharge culture..\n【115】 ### General measures\n【116】 Breast abscess is painful so providing analgesics like profen is indicated to the patients. In order to relieve the pain and decrease the edema, breast support is indicated .\n【117】 ### Lactaitonal breast abscess\n【118】 - Preferred regimen: Flucloxacillin 500 mg BID if there is no allergy to penicillin.\n【119】 - Preferred regimen: Dicloxacillin 500 mg PID if there is no allergy to penicillin.\n【120】 - Alternative regimen: Erythromycin 500 mg BID in case of penicillin allergy.\n【121】 ### Non lactational breast abscess\n【122】 - Preferred regimen: Co-amocyclave 375 TID if there is no allegy to penicillin.\n【123】 - Alternative regimen: Combination of Erythromycin 500 mg BID and Metronidazole 200 mg TID in case of penicillin allergy.\n【124】 ## Surgery\n【125】 The first line of breast abscess treatment is US guided needle aspiration and surgical drainage of the abscess.\n【126】 ### Aspiration\n【127】 Needle aspiration is used particularly in the small and medium sized abscesses. It can be US-guided aspiration or without the US. Local anesthesia is required in order to reduce the pain of the abscess location. It is preferred in case the breast skin is not affected with the abscess. This process is preferably done two or three times to ensure that the abscess location is completely clean from all the pus.\n【128】 ### Surgical drainage\n【129】 If there is no response after several times of needle aspiration to the abscess then surgical drainage is the best line of treatment in this case. If there is no response to the surgical drainage then the last line of treatment is to do excision to the lactiferous duct of the affected breast.\n【130】 Abscess surgical drainage is the best line of treatment in these cases:\n【131】 - The skin is included in the abscess.\n【132】 - Unresponsive abscess to medical therapy or the aspiration.\n【133】 - Large abscesses.\n【134】 Video explaining how the breast abscess is drained:\n【135】 ## Prevention\n【136】 Breast abscess prevention depends on the prevention of the risk factors and the patients hygiene specially in the lactating patients:\n【137】 - Patients should be taught to keep the nipple area clean especially if there is injury\n【138】 - Complete emptying of the breast after feeding the infant in order to prevent milk stasis\n【139】 - Keep the infant in a good contact during breastfeeding\n【140】 - Avoid dehydration in the nipple and the surrounding to prevent cracking\n【141】 - Keep the infant clean\n【142】 - Infection control through washing hands frequently\n【143】 - It is advised to continue breastfeeding after the drainage to prevent recurrence and help healing.\n", "seq_id": 14161, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-18 23:04:50"}

It is defined by short QT intervals  (≤ 360 ms) that increases an individual propensity to atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It occurs due to gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding for cardiac potassium channels KCNH2, KCNQ1 and KCNJ2. The shortened QT interval does not significantly change with heart rate, and there are tall and peaked T waves in the right precordium. It is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, syncope and sudden death.\n【4】 # Historical Perspective\n【5】 The syndrome was first described by Dr. Prebe Bjerregaard MD, DMSc in 1999, who wrote the first clinical report of three members of one family who presented with persistently short QT interval.\n【6】 # Classification\n【7】 - Short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT: This variant is due to a gain-of-function mutation of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current HERG (KCNH channel(IKr).   The variant is a result of missense mutations which increase IKr. It is associated with sudden death and sudden infant death syndrome.\n【8】 - Short QT syndrome type 2 (SQT: Caused by a mutation in the KCNQ1 gene. In the first patient, a g919c substitution in the KCNQ1 gene encoding for the K+ channel KvLQT1 was identified. The mutation led to a gain of function in in the KvLQT1 (I(Ks)) channel.  This variant is associated with ventricular fibrillation.\n【9】 - Short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT:  This variant results from a G514A substitution in the KCNJ2 gene ( a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 172 (D172N)). This causes a defect in the gene coding for the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 (I(K) channel.  The ECG shows asymmetrical T waves.  These patients have an increased risk for re-entry arrhythmias.\n【10】 - Short QT syndrome type 4 (SQT:  A loss of function mutation in the CACNA1C gene alters the  encoding for the α1- and β2b-subunits of the L-type calcium channel. The phenotype is similar to Brugada syndrome combined with a short QT interval.  There is an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\n【11】 - Short QT syndrome type 5 (SQT:  A loss of function mutation in the CACNB2B gene alters the  encoding for the α1- and β2b-subunits of the L-type calcium channel. The phenotype is similar to Brugada syndrome combined with a short QT interval.  There is an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\n【12】 - Short QT syndrome type 6 (SQT:  A loss of function mutation in the CACNAD2D1 coding for the Cavα2δ-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel.\n【13】 # Pathophysiology\n【14】 Short QT syndrome types 1-3 are due to increased activity of outward potassium currents in phase 2 and 3 of the cardiac action potential due to mutations in potassium channels. This causes a shortening of the plateau phase of the action potential (phase , causing a shortening of the overall action potential, leading to an overall shortening of refractory periods and the QT interval. In the families afflicted by short QT syndrome, two different missense mutations have been described in the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG).  These mutations result in expression of the same amino acid change in the cardiac IKr ion channel.  This mutated IKr has increased activity compared to the normal ion channel, and would theoretically explain the above hypothesis.  Short QT syndrome types 4 and 5 and 6 are due to mutations in the calcium channel and consequent reduction  in L-type Ca-channel current.\n【15】 ## Genetics\n【16】 In the families afflicted by short QT syndrome, mutations have been described in three genes, KvLQT1, the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG), and KCNJ2.  Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes cause short QT syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane. These channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells. In cardiac muscle, these ion channels play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, or KCNQ1 gene increase the activity of the channels, which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells. This disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of short QT syndrome. Short QT syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n【17】 Due to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, individuals may have family members with a history of unexplained or sudden death at a young age (even in infancy), palpitations, or atrial fibrillation.  The penetrance of symptoms is high in affected family members. It is  interesting to note that while mutations involving potassium channel genes associated with the long QT syndrome are loss-of-function mutations, the mutations that cause short QT syndrome are gain-of-function mutations.\n【18】 The calcium channels' dysfunction are mostly due to CACNA1C and CACNB2b genes mutation which caused Brugada-like ECG changes with short QT interval. Lastly, a novel mutation of the CACNA2D1 gene was reported in a 17-year-old female who presented with short QT interval and ventricular fibrillation.\n【19】 # Causes\n【20】 The causes of shortening of the QT interval can be divided into primary causes (Short QT syndrome types 1- and secondary causes such as drugs and electrolyte disturbances.\n【21】 ## Common Causes\n【22】 - Hypercalcemia\n【23】 - Digoxin\n【24】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n【25】 - Acidosis\n【26】 - Altered autonomic tone\n【27】 - Digoxin\n【28】 - Hypercalcaemia\n【29】 - Hyperkalemia\n【30】 - Hyperthermia\n【31】 - Lanatoside C\n【32】 - Rufinamide\n【33】 - Short QT syndrome type 1\n【34】 - Short QT syndrome type 2\n【35】 - Short QT syndrome type 3\n【36】 - Short QT syndrome type 4\n【37】 - Short QT syndrome type 5\n【38】 - Short QT syndrome type 6\n【39】 ## Differentiating Short QT Syndrome from other Disorders\n【40】 Short QT may have secondary causes that must be ruled out, since the short QT syndrome is by definition a primary, congenital disease of the heart. Such causes inclu\n【41】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【42】 European studies have estimated a prevalence of 0.02% to 0.1% among adults. A paper from 2015 which tried to assess the prevalence among pediatric population in the U.S. estimated a prevalence of 0.05% at this population. Sudden cardiac arrest has a peak incidence between the second and fourth decades of life, which might indicate an association with testosterone levels in males.\n【43】 # Natural History, Complications, Prognosis\n【44】 The disease can have clinical manifestations from the first year of life until as late as 80 years old, and most cases are symptomatic. Its most frequent symptoms include cardiac arrest (which was the first symptom in 28% of the patients), followed by palpitations, and syncope. Patients may  present with atrial fibrillation and ventricular extrasystoles. They remain at high risk for sudden death during their lifetime and may present with a strong family history for this occurence. Sudden cardiac death presents with two high-risk peaks, one in the first year of life, and another one from 20 to 40 years old. Even though familial association is present in the majority of patients, the yields for genetic tests is low.\n【45】 # Screening\n【46】 Since the disease is so rare, no screening for the general population is advised. Individuals with short QT interval detected on the ECG must first rule out other causes. Genetic screening is performed if a patient presents with: sudden cardiac arrest, history of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation without a known cause, history of unexplained syncope, young individuals with atrial fibrillation, family members diagnosed with short QT syndrome, family members who died from sudden cardiac arrest.\n【47】 # Diagnosis\n【48】 The first step for diagnosing short QT syndrome is ruling out secondary causes, such as the ones cited above. Once them are ruled out, there are two suggested diagnostic approaches in the medical literature: one proposed by GOLLOB, and another one proposed by PRIORI:\n【49】 - Scoring type of diagnostic criteria, as proposed by the Arrhythmia Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute from Drs. Michael H Gollob and Jason D Roberts.\n【50】 The points are summed and interpreted as follows:\n【51】 - > or equal to 4 points: High-probability of SQTS\n【52】 - 3 Points: Intermediate probability of SQTS\n【53】 - 2 points or less: Low probability of SQTS\n【54】 - Diagnostic criteria suggested by PRIORI, 2015 for the European Society of Cardiology:\n【55】 - QTc <340ms or QTc <360ms and one or more of the following:\n【56】 Confirmed pathogenic mutation;\n【57】 Family history of SQTS;\n【58】 Family history of sudden death at 40 years of age;\n【59】 Survival from a VT/VF episode at the absence of heart diseases.\n【60】 - Confirmed pathogenic mutation;\n【61】 - Family history of SQTS;\n【62】 - Family history of sudden death at 40 years of age;\n【63】 - Survival from a VT/VF episode at the absence of heart diseases.\n【64】 ## Electrocardiogam\n【65】 ### Duration of the QT Interval\n【66】 While the QT interval is generally short, the QT interval alone cannot be used to distinguish the patient with short QT syndrome from a normal patient (similar to long QT syndrome).  In general though, if the QTc is < 330 msec in a male, and <340 msec in a female, then short QT syndrome can be diagnosed even in the absence of symptoms as these QT intervals are much shorter than in the rest of the population.  On the other hand, if the QTc is moderately shortened to < 360 msec in a male or < 370 msec in a female, the short QT syndrome should only be diagnosed in the presence of symptoms or a family history according to the guidelines above.\n【67】 The QTc is usually < 300-320 msec.\n【68】 The QTc is usually just under 360 msec\n【69】 ### Variability of the QT Interval with Heart Rate\n【70】 The short QT interval does not vary significantly with the heart rate.  Normally the QT will become longer at slow heart rates and this does not occur among patients with short QT syndrome.  The Bazett formula may overcorrect (i.e. shorten) the QT interval in the patient with bradycardia, and it is therefore important to use treadmill testing to increase the heart rate and confirm the absence of QT interval variation.\n【71】 ### Other ECG findings:\n【72】 - There is a high prevalence of early depolarization patterns on SQTS.\n【73】 - QRS complex is followed by T wave without any ST segment.\n【74】 - Prominent U wave separated by isoelectric T-U segment.\n【75】 - Longer Tpeak - Tend interval.\n【76】 - Prolongation of the QT interval at slower heart rates is suppressed, remaining below the lower limit.\n【77】 - Depressed PQ segment commonly observed in the inferior and anterior leads.\n【78】 - In a very limited number of patients it has been observed that early repolarization (which is present in 65% of patients with SQTS) and a longer T wave peak to T wave end period is associated with the occurrence of arrhythmic events.\n【79】 70% of patients with short QT have a history of either paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or permanent atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation is the first sign of short QT syndrome in 50% of patients.  In young patients with lone atrial fibrillation, the patient should be screened for short QT syndrome.\n【80】 ## Electrophysiologic Studies\n【81】 Among patients with SQTS, the atrial and ventricular refractory periods are shortened (ranging from 120 to 180 ms).  Ventricular fibrillation can be induced on programmed stimulation in 90% of patients with short QT syndrome.  Despite the high rate of VF inducibility, the risk of sudden death in an individual patient is difficult to predict given the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of short QT syndrome and the limited number of patients with short follow-up to date.  The limitations of electrophysiologic testing are highlighted by a study of Giustetto et al in which the sensitivity of electrophysiologic testing in relation to the clinical occurrence of ventricular fibrillation was only 50% (3 of 6 cases).  Importantly, lack of inducibility does not exclude a future episode of ventricular fibrillation.  Thus, the role of electrophysiologic testing in risk stratification of the patient with SQTS is not clear at present.\n【82】 ## Genetic Testing\n【83】 Because new genetic variants of SQTS are still being identified, a negative genetic test for existing variants does not exclude the presence of SQTS.  A negative genetic test for existing variants could mean that a patient with a short QT interval does not have a heretofore unidentified variant of SQTS.\n【84】 However, among family members of an affected patient, genetic testing may identify the syndrome in an asymptomatic patient, and may  rule out the presence of the syndrome in asymptomatic patients.\n【85】 Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes cause short QT syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane. These channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells. In cardiac muscle, these ion channels play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, or KCNQ1 gene increase the activity of the channels, which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells. This disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of short QT syndrome. Short QT syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n【86】 ### Centers Performing Genetic Testing for Short QT Syndrome\n【87】 - Gene Tests: Short QT Syndrome 1\n【88】 - Gene Tests: Short QT Syndrome 2\n【89】 - Gene Tests: Short QT Syndrome 3\n【90】 # Treatment\n【91】 ## Device Based Therapy\n【92】 An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in symptomatic patients who have either survived a sudden cardiac arrest and/or have had documented episodes of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias with or without syncope. There's a problem with ICD in such patients though, because the tall and peaked T wave can be interpreted as a short R-R interval provoking inappropriate shock.\n【93】 Generally accepted criteria for implantation of an AICD  inclu\n【94】 - Inducibility on electrophysiologic testing;\n【95】 - Positive genetic test, although a negative result does not exclude the presence of a previously unreported mutation or the occurrence of a future arrhythmic event.\n【96】 ### Complications of AICD Placement\n【97】 Inappropriate shocks may be delivered due to:\n【98】 - The occurence of tachycardias such as sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.\n【99】 - Oversensing of the tall, narrow peaked T wave.\n【100】 ## Pharmacologic Therapy\n【101】 ### Short QT Syndrome 1 (SQT\n【102】 The efficacy of pharmacotherapy in preventing ventricular fibrillation has only been studies in patients with SQT1.  Given the limited number of patients studied, and the limited duration of follow-up, pharmacotherapy as primary or secondary preventive therapy for patients with SQT1 cannot be recommended at this time.  AICD implantation remains the mainstay of therapy in these patients.  Pharmacotherapy may play an adjunctive role in reducing the risk of events in patients with an AICD as described below in the indications section.\n【103】 Patients with Short QT Syndrome 1 (SQT have a mutation in KCNH2 (HERG).  Class IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs do not produce any significant QT interval prolongation  . Flecainide has not been shown to consistently reduce the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Although it does not prolong the QT interval in SQT1 patients, propafenone reduces the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation in SQT1 patients.\n【104】 Quinidine in contrast may be effective in patients with SQT1 in so far as it blocks both potassium channels (IKr, IKs, Ito, IKATP and IK and the inward sodium and calcium channels.  In four out of four patients, Quinidine prolonged the QT interval from 263 +/- 12 msec to 362 +/-25 msec, most likely due to its effects on prolonging the action potential and by virtue of its action on the IK channels. Although Quinidine was successful in preventing the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation in 4 out of 4 patients, it is unclear if the prolongation of the QT interval by quinidine would reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. It  prolonged the ST interval and T wave durations, restored the heart rate dependent variability in the QT interval and decreased depolarization dispersion in patients with SQT1.\n【105】 There is a report which states that disopyramide was  effectively used in two patients with SQT-1, increasing their QT interval and ventricular refractory period while  abbreviating the Tpeak-Tend interval.\n【106】 As atrial fibrillation is  very commonly found on those patients propafenone has  been successfully used to prevent its paroxysms, without having any effect on QT interval.\n【107】 Although pharmacotherapy can be used to suppress the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients with SQT1, AICD implantation is the mainstay of therapy, and pharmacotherapy to prevent sudden death should is only indicated if AICD implantation is not possible.\n【108】 ### Indications for Pharmacologic Therapy\n【109】 The following are indications for pharmacologic therapy of SQTS:\n【110】 - In children as an alternate to AICD implantation;\n【111】 - In patients with a contraindications AICD implantation;\n【112】 - In patients who decline AICD implantation;\n【113】 - In patients with appropriate AICD discharges to reduce the frequency of discharges;\n【114】 - In patients with atrial fibrillation to reduce the frequency of symptomatic episodes.\n", "seq_id": 11929, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:15", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:17:23"}

MULTAQ is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n【22】 - Nursing mothers\n【23】 - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients\n【24】 - MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death.\n【25】 - Cardiovascular Death and heart failure in Permanent AF\n【26】 - MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF. Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF.\n【27】 - Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AF\n【28】 - In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy.\n【29】 - New Onset or Worsening heart failure\n【30】 - New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo controlled study in patients with permanent AF increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.\n【31】 - Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure, such as weight gain, dependent edema, or increasing shortness of breath. If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization, discontinue MULTAQ.\n【32】 - Liver Injury\n【33】 - Hepatocellular liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. Advise patients treated with MULTAQ to report immediately symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, or itching). Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment, but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury. If hepatic injury is suspected, promptly discontinue MULTAQ and test serum enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum bilirubin, to establish whether there is liver injury. If liver injury is found, institute appropriate treatment and investigate the probable cause. Do not restart MULTAQ in patients without another explanation for the observed liver injury.\n【34】 - Pulmonary Toxicity\n【35】 - Cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the post-marketing setting. Onset of dyspnea or non-productive cough may be related to pulmonary toxicity and patients should be carefully evaluated clinically. If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, MULTAQ should be discontinued.\n【36】 - Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia with Potassium-Depleting Diuretics\n【37】 - Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with concomitant administration of potassium-depleting diuretics. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of MULTAQ and maintained in the normal range during administration of MULTAQ.\n【38】 - QT Interval Prolongation\n【39】 - Dronedarone induces a moderate (average of about 10 ms but much greater effects have been observed) QTc (Bazett) prolongation and . If the QTc Bazett interval is ≥500 ms, discontinue MULTAQ.\n【40】 - Renal Impairment and Failure\n【41】 - Marked increase in serum creatinine, pre-renal azotemia and acute renal failure, often in the setting of heart failure or hypovolemia, have been reported in patients taking MULTAQ. In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.\n【42】 - Small increases in creatinine levels (about 0.1 mg/dL) following dronedarone treatment initiation have been shown to be a result of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion.\n【43】 - The elevation has a rapid onset, reaches a plateau after 7 days and is reversible after discontinuation.\n【44】 - Women of Childbearing Potential\n【45】 - Premenopausal women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy must use effective contraception while using MULTAQ. Dronedarone caused fetal harm in animal studies at doses equivalent to recommended human doses. Counsel women of childbearing potential regarding appropriate contraceptive choices.\n【46】 - In clinical trials, premature discontinuation because of adverse reactions occurred in 11.8% of the dronedarone-treated patients and in 7.7% of the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with MULTAQ were gastrointestinal disorders (3.2 % versus 1.8% in the placebo group) and QT prolongation (1.5% versus 0.5% in the placebo group).\n【47】 - The most frequent adverse reactions observed with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily in the 5 studies were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and asthenia.\n【48】 -  displays adverse reactions more common with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily than with placebo in AF or AFL patients, presented by system organ class and by decreasing order of frequency. Adverse laboratory and ECG effects are presented separately in\n【49】 - Photosensitivity reaction and dysgeusia have  been reported at an incidence less than 1% in patients treated with MULTAQ.\n【50】 - The following laboratory data/ECG parameters were reported with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily.\n【51】 - Assessment of demographic factors such as gender or age on the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not suggest an excess of adverse events in any particular sub-group.\n【52】 Cardiac: New or worsening heart failure,atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction has been reported very rarely.\n【53】 Hepatic: Liver Injury\n【54】 Respiratory: Interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis\n【55】 Immune: Anaphylactic reactions including angioedema\n【56】 Vascular: Vasculitis, including leukocytoclastic vasculitis\n【57】 - Drugs prolonging the QT interval (inducing Torsade de Pointes)\n【58】 - Co-administration of drugs prolonging the QT interval (such as certain phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain macrolide antibiotics, and Class I and III antiarrhythmics) is contraindicated because of the potential risk of Torsade de Pointes-type ventricular tachycardia.\n【59】 - Digoxin\n【60】 - In the ANDROMEDA (patients with recently decompensated heart failure) and PALLAS (patients with permanent AF) trials baseline use of digoxin was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic or sudden death in dronedarone-treated patients compared to placebo. In patients not taking digoxin, no difference in risk of sudden death was observed in the dronedarone vs. placebo groups.\n【61】 - Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of dronedarone (such as decreased AV-node conduction). Dronedarone increases exposure to digoxin.\n【62】 - Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n【63】 - Calcium channel blockers\n【64】 - Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects on the sinus and AV nodes could potentiate dronedarone's effects on conduction.\n【65】 - Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n【66】 - Beta-blockers\n【67】 - In clinical trials, bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in combination with beta-blockers.\n【68】 - Give a low dose of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n【69】 - Ketoconazole and other potent CYP 3A inhibitors\n【70】 - Concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP 3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and nefazodone is contraindicated because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased .\n【71】 - Grapefruit juice\n【72】 - Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased.\n【73】 - Rifampin and other CYP 3A inducers\n【74】 - Avoid rifampin or other CYP 3A inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John's wort because they decrease exposure to dronedarone significantly.\n【75】 - Calcium channel blockers\n【76】 - Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate CYP 3A inhibitors and increase dronedarone exposure. Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n【77】 - Simvastatin\n【78】 - Dronedarone increased simvastatin/simvastatin acid exposure. Avoid doses greater than 10 mg once daily of simvastatin.\n【79】 - Other statins\n【80】 - Because of multiple mechanisms of interaction with statins (CYPs and transporters), follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP 3A and P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone.\n【81】 - Calcium channel blockers\n【82】 - Dronedarone increased the exposure of calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine). Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n【83】 - Sirolimus, tacrolimus, and other CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range\n【84】 - Dronedarone can increase plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other CYP 3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range when given orally. Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.\n【85】 - Beta-blockers and other CYP 2D6 substrates\n【86】 - Dronedarone increased the exposure of propranolol and metoprolol. Give low doses of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability. Other CYP 2D6 substrates, including other beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have increased exposure upon co-administration with dronedarone.\n【87】 - P-glycoprotein substrates\n【88】 - Digoxin\n【89】 - Dronedarone increased digoxin exposure by inhibiting the P-gp transporter. Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n【90】 - Dabigatran\n【91】 - Exposure to dabigatran is higher when it is administered with dronedarone than when it is administered alone.\n【92】 - Other P-gp substrates are expected to have increased exposure when co-administered with dronedarone.\n【93】 - Warfarin\n【94】 - When co-administered with dronedarone exposure to S-warfarin was slightly higher than when warfarin was administered alone. There were no clinically significant increases in INR.\n【95】 - More patients experienced clinically significant INR elevations (≥  usually within 1 week after starting dronedarone vs. placebo in patients taking oral anticoagulants in ATHENA. However, no excess risk of bleeding was observed in the dronedarone group.\n【96】 - Postmarketing cases of increased INR with or without bleeding events have been reported in warfarin-treated patients initiated on dronedarone. Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin.\n【97】 - When pregnant rats received dronedarone at oral doses greater than or equal to the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis), fetuses had increased rates of external, visceral and skeletal malformations (cranioschisis, cleft palate, incomplete evagination of pineal body, brachygnathia, partially fused carotid arteries, truncus arteriosus, abnormal lobation of the liver, partially duplicated inferior vena cava, brachydactyly, ectrodactylia, syndactylia, and anterior and/or posterior club feet). When pregnant rabbits received dronedarone, at a dose approximately half the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis), fetuses had an increased rate of skeletal abnormalities (anomalous ribcage and vertebrae, pelvic asymmetry) at doses ≥20 mg/kg (the lowest dose tested and approximately half the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\n【98】 Actual animal doses: rat (≥80 mg/kg/day); rabbit (≥20 mg/kg)\n【99】 - Treatment with Class I or III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, - flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, disopyramide, dofetilide, sotalol) or drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole) must be stopped before starting MULTAQ.\n【100】 - Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment, but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury\n【101】 - In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.\n【102】 - If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n【103】 - Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.\n【104】 - Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin.\n【105】 - In the event of overdosage, monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.\n【106】 It is not known whether dronedarone or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration).\n【107】 - There is no specific antidote available.\n【108】 - N-{2-butyl-3-benzofuran-5-yl} methanesulfonamide, hydrochloride.\n【109】 - Dronedarone HCl is a white fine powder that is practically insoluble in water and freely soluble in methylene chloride and methanol.\n【110】 - Its empirical formula is C31H44N2O5 S, HCl with a relative molecular mass of 593.2. Its structural formula is:\n【111】 - MULTAQ is provided as tablets for oral administration.\n【112】 - Each tablet of MULTAQ contains 400 mg of dronedarone (expressed as base).\n【113】 The inactive ingredients are:\n【114】 - Core of the tablets- hypromellose, starch, crospovidone, poloxamer 407, lactose monohydrate, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate.\n【115】 - Coating / polishing of the tablets- hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 6000, titanium dioxide, carnauba wax.\n【116】 - Dronedarone exhibits properties of all four Vaughn-Williams antiarrhythmic classes, although it is unclear which of these are important in producing dronedarone's clinical effects. The effect of dronedarone on 12-lead ECG parameters (heart rate, PR, and QTc) was investigated in healthy subjects following repeated oral doses up to 1600 mg once daily or 800 mg twice daily for 14 days and 1600 mg twice daily for 10 days. In the dronedarone 400 mg twice daily group, there was no apparent effect on heart rate; a moderate heart rate lowering effect (about 4 bpm) was noted at 800 mg twice daily. There was a clear dose-dependent effect on PR-interval with an increase of +5 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to +50 ms at 1600 mg twice daily. There was a moderate dose related effect on the QTc-interval with an increase of +10 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to +25 ms with 1600 mg twice daily.\n【117】 - DAFNE was a dose-response study in patients with recurrent AF, evaluating the effect of dronedarone in comparison with placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm. The doses of dronedarone in this study were 400, 600, and 800 mg twice a day. In this small study, doses above 400 mg were not more effective and were less well tolerated.\n【118】 - Absorption\n【119】 - Because of presystemic first pass metabolism the absolute bioavailability of dronedarone without food is low, about 4%. It increases to approximately 15% when dronedarone is administered with a high fat meal. After oral administration in fed conditions, peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and the main circulating active metabolite (N-debutyl metabolite) are reached within 3 to 6 hours. After repeated administration of 400 mg twice daily, steady state is reached within 4 to 8 days of treatment and the mean accumulation ratio for dronedarone ranges from 2.6 to 4.5. The steady state Cmax and exposure of the main N-debutyl metabolite is similar to that of the parent compound. The pharmacokinetics of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite both deviate moderately from dose proportionality: a 2-fold increase in dose results in an approximate 2.5- to 3.0- fold increase with respect to Cmax and AUC.\n【120】 - Distribution\n【121】 - The in vitro plasma protein binding of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite is >98 % and not saturable. Both compounds bind mainly to albumin. After intravenous (IV) administration the volume of distribution at steady state is about 1400 L.\n【122】 - Metabolism\n【123】 - Dronedarone is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP 3A. The initial metabolic pathway includes N-debutylation to form the active N-debutyl metabolite, oxidative deamination to form the inactive propanoic acid metabolite, and direct oxidation. The metabolites undergo further metabolism to yield over 30 uncharacterized metabolites. The N-debutyl metabolite exhibits pharmacodynamic activity but is 1/10 to 1/3 as potent as dronedarone.\n【124】 - Excretion/Elimination\n【125】 - In a mass balance study with orally administered dronedarone (14C-labeled) approximately 6% of the labeled dose was excreted in urine, mainly as metabolites (no unchanged compound excreted in urine), and 84% was excreted in feces, mainly as metabolites. Dronedarone and its N-debutyl active metabolite accounted for less than 15% of the resultant radioactivity in the plasma.\n【126】 - After IV administration the plasma clearance of dronedarone ranges from 130 to 150 L/h. The elimination half-life of dronedarone ranges from 13 to 19 hours.\n【127】 - Dronedarone did not demonstrate genotoxic potential in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, or an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. S-9 processed dronedarone, however, was positive in a V79 transfected Chinese hamster V79 assay.\n【128】 - In fertility studies conducted with female rats, dronedarone given prior to breeding and implantation caused an increase in irregular estrus cycles and cessation of cycling at doses ≥10mg/kg (equivalent to 0.12× the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\n【129】 Corpora lutea, implantations and live fetuses were decreased at 100 mg/kg (equivalent to 1.2× the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). There were no reported effects on mating behavior or fertility of male rats at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day.\n【130】 - ATHENA was a multicenter, multinational, double blind, and randomized placebo-controlled study of dronedarone in 4628 patients with a recent history of AF/AFL who were in sinus rhythmor who were to be converted to sinus rhythm. The objective of the study was to determine whether dronedarone could delay death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons.\n【131】 - Initially patients were to be ≥70 years old, or <70 years old with at least one risk factor (including hypertension, diabetes, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter ≥50 mm or LVEF<0.. The inclusion criteria were later changed such that patients were to be ≥75 years old, or ≥70 years old with at least one risk factor. Patients had to have both AF/AFL and sinus rhythm documented within the previous 6 months. Patients could have been in AF/AFL or in sinus rhythm at the time of randomization, but patients not in sinus rhythm were expected to be either electrically or chemically converted to normal sinus rhythm after anticoagulation.\n【132】 - Subjects were randomized and treated for up to 30 months (median follow-up: 22 months) with either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily (2301 patients) or placebo (2327 patients), in addition to conventional therapy for cardiovascular diseases that included beta-blockers (71%), ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (69%), digoxin (14%), calcium antagonists (14%), statins (39%), oral anticoagulants (60%), aspirin (44%), other chronic antiplatelet therapy (6%) and diuretics (54%).\n【133】 - The primary endpoint of the study was the time to first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons or death from any cause. Time to death from any cause, time to first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons, and time to cardiovascular death and time to all causes of death were  explored.\n【134】 - Patients ranged in age from 23 to 97 years; 42% were 75 years old or older. Forty-seven percent (47%) of patients were female and a majority was Caucasian (89%). Approximately seventy percent (71%) of those enrolled had no history of heart failure. The median ejection fraction was 60%. Twenty-nine percent (29%) of patients had heart failure, mostly NYHA class II (17%). The majority had hypertension (86%) and structural heart disease (60%).\n【135】 - Results are shown in  MULTAQ reduced the combined endpoint of cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause by 24.2% when compared to placebo. This difference was entirely attributable to its effect on cardiovascular hospitalization, principally hospitalization related to AF.\n【136】 - Other endpoints, death from any cause and first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons, are shown in  Secondary endpoints count all first events of a particular type, whether or not they were preceded by a different type of event.\n【137】 - The Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves showing the time to first event are displayed in  The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 30 month follow-up period.\n【138】 - : Kaplan-Meier Cumulative Incidence Curves from Randomization to First Cardiovascular Hospitalization or Death from any Cause\n【139】 - Reasons for hospitalization included major bleeding (1% in both groups), syncope (1% in both groups), and ventricular arrhythmia (<1% in both groups).\n【140】 The reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause was generally consistent in all subgroups based on baseline characteristics or medications (ACE inhibitors or ARBs; beta-blockers, digoxin, statins, calcium channel blockers, diuretics)  ).\n【141】 - : Relative Risk (MULTAQ versus placebo) Estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals According to Selected Baseline Characteristi\n【142】 a Determined from Cox regression model\n【143】 b P-value of interaction between baseline characteristics and treatment based on Cox regression model\n【144】 c Calcium antagonists with heart rate lowering effects restricted to diltiazem, verapamil and bepridil\n【145】 - In EURIDIS and ADONIS, a total of 1237 patients in sinus rhythm with a prior episode of AF or AFL were randomized in an outpatient setting and treated with either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily (n= or placebo (n= on top of conventional therapies (including oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, chronic antiplatelet agents, diuretics, statins, digoxin, and calcium channel blockers). Patients had at least one ECG-documented AF/AFL episode during the 3 months prior to study entry but were in sinus rhythm for at least one hour. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 88 years, with the majority being Caucasian (97%), male (70%) patients. The most common co-morbidities were hypertension (56.8%) and structural heart disease (41.5%), including coronary heart disease (21.8%). Patients were followed for 12 months.\n【146】 - In the pooled data from EURIDIS and ADONIS as well as in the individual trials, dronedarone delayed the time to first recurrence of AF/AFL (primary endpoint), lowering the risk of first AF/AFL recurrence during the 12-month study period by about 25%,with an absolute difference in recurrence rate of about 11% at 12 months.\n【147】 - Patients recently hospitalized with symptomatic heart failure and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (wall motion index ≤1. were randomized to either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily or matching placebo, with a primary composite end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients enrolled in ANDROMEDA were predominantly NYHA Class II (40%) and III (57%), and only 25% had AF at randomization. After enrollment of 627 patients and a median follow-up of 63 days, the trial was terminated because of excess mortality in the dronedarone group. Twenty-five  patients in the dronedarone group died versus 12 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio 2.13; 95% CI: 1.07 to 4.. The main reason for death was worsening heart failure. Baseline digoxin therapy was reported in 6/16 dronedarone patients vs. 1/16 placebo patients who died of arrhythmia. In patients without baseline use of digoxin, no excess risk of arrhythmic death was observed in the dronedarone vs. placebo groups.\n【148】 - There were  excess hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons in the dronedarone group (71 versus 51 for placebo).\n【149】 - Patients with permanent AF (AF documented in 2 weeks prior to randomization and at least 6 months prior to randomization in whom cardioversion had failed or was not planned) and additional risk factors for thromboembolism (coronary artery disease, prior stroke or TIA, symptomatic heart failure, LVEF 75 with hypertension and diabetes) were randomized to dronedarone 400 mg twice daily or placebo.\n【150】 - After enrollment of 3236 patients (placebo=1617 and dronedarone= and a median follow up of 3.7 months for placebo and 3.9 for dronedarone, the study was terminated because of a significant increase in\n【151】 - Mortality: 25 dronedarone vs. 13 placebo (HR, 1.94; CI, 0.99 to 3.. The majority of deaths in the dronedarone group were classified as arrhythmic/sudden deaths (HR, 3.26; CI: 1.06 to 10.. Baseline digoxin therapy was reported in 11/13 dronedarone patients who died of arrhythmia. None of the arrhythmic deaths on placebo  reported use of digoxin. In patients without baseline use of digoxin, no excess risk of arrhythmic death was observed in the dronedarone vs. placebo groups.\n【152】 - Stroke: 23 dronedarone vs. 10 placebo (HR, 2.32; CI: 1.11 to 4.. The increased risk of stroke observed with dronedarone was observed in the first two weeks of therapy (10 dronedarone vs. 1 placebo), most of the subjects treated with dronedarone did not have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0.\n【153】 - Hospitalizations for heart failure in the dronedarone group: 43 dronedarone vs. 24 placebo (HR, 1.81; CI: 1.10 to 2..\n【154】 - Bottles of 60 tablets, NDC 0024-4142-60\n【155】 - Bottles of 180 tablets, NDC 0024-4142-18\n【156】 - Bottles of 500 tablets NDC 0024-4142-50\n【157】 - Box of 10 blisters (10 tablets per blister) NDC 0024-4142-10\n【158】 - MULTAQ should be administered with a meal.

Mechlorethamine HCl is a white to off white solid that is very soluble in water and methanol, partially soluble in acetone, and generally not soluble in organic solvents.\n【109】 - Mechlorethamine HCl is designated chemically as 2-chloro-N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-methylethanamine hydrochloride. The molecular weight is 192.52 and the melting point is 108-111°C. The empirical formula is C5H11Cl2NHCl, and the structural formula is: CH3N(CH2CH2Cl)2HCl.\n【110】 - Each tube of mechlorethamine  contains 60g of a gel containing 0.016% w/w of mechlorethamine (equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCl) in a base of the following inactive ingredients: diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerin, lactic acid, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium chloride, menthol, edetate disodium, butylated hydroxytoluene.\n【111】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【112】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Mechlorethamine (topical) in the drug label.\n【113】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【114】 - Systemic exposure was undetectable after topical administration of mechlorethamine  to patients. Blood samples were analyzed from 16 and 15 patients following treatment with mechlorethamine  (mechlorethamine gel 0.016%) and an identical formulation consisting of mechlorethamine 0.032% w/w, respectively. For patients who received mechlorethamine 0.016%, samples were collected to measure mechlorethamine concentrations prior to dosing, on day 1, and at the first month visit. Following the topical administration of mechlorethamine 0.016%, there were no detectable plasma mechlorethamine concentrations observed in any of the patients. Patients who received mechlorethamine 0.032% had no measurable concentrations of mechlorethamine or half-mustard after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment.\n【115】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【116】 - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【117】 - Mechlorethamine is a probable carcinogen in humans. There are reports of non-melanoma skin cancer with the use of topical mechlorethamine in patients . Mechlorethamine was carcinogenic in mice when injected intravenously with four doses of 2.4 mg/kg (0.1% solution) at 2-week intervals with observations for up to 2 years. An increased incidence of thymic lymphomas and pulmonary adenomas was observed. Painting mechlorethamine on the skin of mice at a dose of 4 mg/kg for periods of up to 33 weeks resulted in squamous cell tumors in 9 of 33 mice.\n【118】 - Mechlorethamine was genotoxic in multiple genetic toxicology studies, which included mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and chromosome aberrations in mammalian cells. Dominant lethal mutations were produced in ICR/Ha Swiss mice.\n【119】 - The reproductive effects of mechlorethamine  have not been studied; however, published literature indicates that fertility may be impaired by systemically administered mechlorethamine. Mechlorethamine impaired fertility in the rat at a daily dose of 500 mg/kg intravenously for two weeks. Treatment with intravenous mechlorethamine has been associated with delayed catamenia, oligomenorrhea, and temporary or permanent amenorrhea.\n【120】 - Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n【121】 - Animal studies have shown mechlorethamine to be corrosive to skin and eyes, a powerful vesicant, irritating to the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, and highly toxic by the oral route.\n【122】 # Clinical Studies\n【123】 - The efficacy of mechlorethamine  was assessed in a randomized, multicenter, observer-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial of 260 patients with Stage IA, IB, and IIA mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-CTCL) who had received at least one prior skin-directed therapy. Qualifying prior therapies included topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, Targretin gel, and topical nitrogen mustard. Patients were not required to be refractory to or intolerant of prior therapies.\n【124】 - Patients were stratified based on Stage (IA vs. IB and IIA) and then randomized to receive mechlorethamine  0.016% (equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCl) or Aquaphor-based mechlorethamine HCl 0.02% ointment (Comparator) at 13 centers in the United States. Eighteen patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to protocol violations involving randomization at a single site.\n【125】 - Study drug was to be applied topically on a daily basis for 12 months. Concomitant use of topical corticosteroids was not permitted during the study. Dosing could be suspended or continued with reduced frequency for dermatitis. The mean daily usage of mechlorethamine  gel was 2.8 g (1 to 2 tubes per month). The maximum daily usage was 10.5 g (5 to 6 tubes per month).\n【126】 - Patients were evaluated for a response on a monthly basis for the first 6 months and then every 2 months for the last 6 months using the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score. The CAILS score is obtained by adding the severity score of each of the following categories for up to 5 index lesions: erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, and surface area. Severity was graded from 0 (none) to 8 (severe) for erythema and scaling; 0 to 3 for plaque elevation; and 0 to 9 for surface area. A response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline CAILS score which was confirmed at the next visit at least 4 weeks later. A complete response was defined as a confirmed CAILS score of 0. Non-inferiority was considered to have been demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the ratio of response rates (mechlorethamine /Comparator) was greater than or equal to 0.75.\n【127】 - Patients were  evaluated using the Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT score is derived by measuring each involved area as a percentage of total body surface area (%BSA) and multiplying it by a severity weighting factor (1=patch, 2=plaque, 3=tumor or ulcer). A response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline SWAT score which was confirmed at the next visit at least 4 weeks later.\n【128】 - The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. The median age was 57 years in the mechlorethamine  arm and 58 years in the comparator arm. The majority of the patients were male (60% in mechlorethamine  arm, 59% in Comparator arm) and white (75% in both treatment arms). The median number of prior therapies was 2 in both treatment arms. The most common prior therapy was topical corticosteroids (used in 86% of patients in both treatment arms). The median body surface area (BSA) involvement at baseline was 8.5% (range 1%, 61%) in the mechlorethamine  arm and 9% (range 1%, 76%) in the comparator arm.\n【129】 - Sixty percent (60%) of the patients on the mechlorethamine  arm and 48% of patients on the comparator arm achieved a response based on the CAILS score. mechlorethamine  was non-inferior to the comparator based on a CAILS overall response rate ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 0.98, 1.. Complete responses constituted a minority of the CAILS or SWAT overall responses (TABLE . The onset of CAILS overall response for both treatment arms showed a wide range from 1 to 11 months.\n【130】 # How Supplied\n【131】 - mechlorethamine  is supplied in 60g tubes of 0.016% w/w mechlorethamine as a clear gel .\n【132】 - Prior to dispensing, store in the freezer at -13°F to 5°F (-25°C to -15°C).

It was formally established as a general UC campus by the Regents of the University of California in 1959. UC Davis is a public, coeducational university located in the city of Davis, California, about fifteen miles west of Sacramento in the Sacramento Valley, part of California's Central Valley.\n【2】 UC Davis has grown to become a prestigious public research university, especially in the arts, humanities, life sciences, health sciences, and engineering. UCD  has renowned graduate programs, such as the UC Davis School of Medicine (which includes the UC Davis Medical Center), the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, the UC Davis School of Law, and the UC Davis Graduate School of Management.\n【3】 U.S. News & World Report 2008 America's Best Colleges ranked UC Davis the 42nd best university in the United States, 11th best public university in the United States, and 4th best of all the UC schools (after Berkeley, Los Angeles, and San Diego ). UC Davis is  the 3rd oldest campus of the University of California system, and is a Public Ivy institution of higher education .\n【4】 In addition to research and academics, the UCD athletics program is  quite respectable; Aggie teams have recently joined NCAA Division I athletics. UC Davis is  one of the only three UC schools with a football team (the other two being Cal and UCLA), playing in the Great West Football Conference.\n【5】 # History\n【6】 In 1905, Governor George Pardee signed into law an act to establish a university farm school for the University of California. It would be more than a year before that commission selected a tiny town, then known as Davisville as the site. What was to become the third UC Campus opened its doors to 40 degree students (all male) from UC Berkeley in January 1909 as the \"University Farm.\" (The farm had begun accepting non-degree farmers' short courses in October of 1908; there were initially around 115 such attendees.) The establishment of the Farm was largely the result of the vision and perseverance of Peter J. Shields, secretary of the State Agricultural Society, and the namesake of UC Davis's Peter J. Shields Library. He began to champion the cause of a University Farm to teach agriculture in a more applied fashion after hearing about California students who chose to go to out-of-state universities due to the lack of such programs in the University of California at that time. He later stated:\n【7】 \"There was a College of Agriculture at Berkeley in connection with the University of California, but it was purely academic. It was largely confined to the study of botany and chemistry; it had no farm and little prestige; it was apt to be thought of as a snap curriculum, attracting students who wanted to go to college but wanted to avoid its more difficult work.\"\n【8】 After two failed bills, a law authorizing the creation of a University Farm was passed in March 18, 1905, and Yolo County, home to some of California's prime farmland, was chosen as the site. The Farm accepted its first female students in 1914 from Berkeley. Renamed in 1922 the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture, it continued growing at a breakneck pace: in 1916 the Farm's 314 students occupied the original 778 acre (3 km²) campus, but by 1951 it had already expanded to a size of 3,000 acres (12 km²). In 1959, the campus was declared by the Regents of the University of California as the seventh general campus in the University of California system. It has since grown into a vibrant and politically active campus.\n【9】 # Campus\n【10】 The University of California, Davis campus is the largest campus in the UC system, spanning over 5,500 acres (22.2 square km) and adjacent to Interstate Highway 80. The Davis campus is the only school within the UC system with an airport, just west of main campus, and is one of two UC schools with its own fire department; the other being UCSC. It is  one of only two UC's, the other being UC Berkeley, with a nuclear lab. It is  one of a handful of universities that spans two counties: Yolo and Solano.\n【11】 The UC Davis campus is considered world-renowned and has been praised for its architecture and picturesque scenery. UC Davis offers broad green lawns and bubbling fountains, sculpture gardens and fine museums, lush landscaping and an intriguing mix of architectural styles. There are huge amounts of well-kept and attractive open space on the UC Davis campus, from Hutchison, Dobbins, Russell, and Howard Fields to various soccer, rugby, lacrosse, and tennis fields. It is surrounded by the residential area of the city of Davis.\n【12】 The UC Davis University Library, which includes the Peter J. Shields Library, the Physical Sciences & Engineering Library, the Carlson Health Sciences Library, and the Medical Center Library in Sacramento, contains more than 3 million volumes and offers a number of special collections and services for undergraduates and graduates. The Peter J. Shields Library is a vast building with three different architectural styles due to various construction and extensions being added; it is the main library where students study on-campus, with a 24-hour reading room, open computer labs, and unique furniture.\n【13】 Towards the northeast end of campus is the Quad, a large rectangular field which sits adjacent to Freeborn Hall and the Memorial Union, which houses various establishments such as the UC Davis Bookstore, ASUCD Coffee House, food courts, Post Office, Sky Room, and the MU Games Area. The northeast side of campus holds more of the \"core\" buildings that were built earlier in UC Davis's history, such as Wellman Hall, Shields Library, Mrak Hall, and Hutchison Hall, as well as the North Entry Parking Structure.\n【14】 The northwest end of campus holds the majority of the Segundo undergraduate housing complex and various alternative non-undergraduate housing such as Orchard Park, Russell Park, and The Colleges at LaRue Apartments. The Activities and Recreation Center, or the ARC, is  located near the Segundo complex. Off-campus to the northwest is the Cuarto undergraduate housing complex, which has two dining commons.\n【15】 The Tercero undergraduate housing complex is located near the true geographic center of the UC Davis campus, to the north of the beautiful Aboretum Waterway, which stretches longitudinally through almost the entirety of the south end of campus. The Arboretum is a public garden with over 4,000 kinds of trees and plants that stretches for over 100 acres (.40 square km) and located near the Waterway.\n【16】 The majority of Veterinary Medicine, Equestrian Center, and Animal Sciences buildings are located near the Arboretum Waterway, away from the core campus; the West Entry Parking Complex, the Silo Union, and the newly constructed Science Lecture Hall and the Science Laboratory Building are located nearer to the Tercero residence halls and the core of campus. The Mondavi Center is  located near the Tecero complex, a glitzy upscale home for the University Symphony Orchestra and other cultural events.\n【17】 There are five public art statues found around campus, collectively called The Egghead Series, sculpted by former art professor, Robert Arneson, who taught at Davis from 1962-1991 before his death in 1992. The \"egghead\" statues are considered by many to be among the most recognizable features of UC Davis's campus, and have even inspired a recent blog maintained by University staff.\n【18】 \"Bookhead\" is located at the Shields Library plaza, \"Yin & Yang\" is located at the Fine Arts Complex, \" No Evil/Hear No Evil\" is at the east lawn of King Hall, \"Eye on Mrak (Fatal Laff)\" is at the Mrak Hall mall, and \"Stargazer\" is located between North Hall and Young Hall. The \"Yin & Yang\" egg heads have been recast and duplicated for installment near the Port of San Francisco Ferry Building in San Francisco.\n【19】 # Academics\n【20】 UC Davis academic spectrum is rich in the arts, humanities, life sciences, health sciences, and engineering. The university has a world-class medical center in downtown Sacramento. The university  has a Department of Viticulture and Enology (concerning the scientific study of grape-growing and winemaking) that has been and continues to be responsible for significant advancements in winemaking utilized by many Californian wineries. The campus is noted for its Agricultural and Resource Economics programs, and the large Department of Animal Science through which students can study at the university's own on-campus dairy, meat-processing plant, equestrian facility, and experimental farm. Students of Environmental Horticulture and other botanical sciences have many acres of campus farmland and the University of California, Davis, Arboretum at their disposal. The university  has world-class faculty in the arts and letters and a large and diverse College of Engineering. The Department of Applied Science was founded and formerly chaired by physicist Edward Teller. Studio arts, theatre, and dance are studied extensively on the campus, and the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts features artists from all over the globe.\n【21】 UC Davis has an excellent reputation in graduate studies and has several professional schools, including the Graduate School of Management, School of Education, School of Law, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and School of Veterinary Medicine.\n【22】 The university is  host to the largest Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program in California, with more than 120 cadets. With more than sixty years in existence, it currently commissions roughly 30 to 40 graduating seniors as second lieutenants every year.\n【23】 Colleges and Schools\n【24】 UC Davis is organized into the following schools and colleges:\n【25】 - Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing\n【26】 - UC Davis College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences\n【27】 - UC Davis College of Biological Sciences\n【28】 - UC Davis College of Engineering\n【29】 - UC Davis College of Letters and Science\n【30】 - UC Davis Graduate School of Management\n【31】 - UC Davis School of Education\n【32】 - UC Davis School of Law\n【33】 - UC Davis School of Medicine\n【34】 - UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine\n【35】 ## Research\n【36】 According to the National Science Foundation, UC Davis spent $456,653,000 on research and development in the fiscal year 2002-2003, ranking it 14th in the nation. Specifically, UC Davis's expenditures nationally ranked first in agricultural research ($25,683,, seventh in biological research ($118,477,, and 13th in the life sciences ($336,796,.\n【37】 Its faculty includes 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 6 members of the National Academy of Engineering, 7 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 MacArthur Fellows and one member of the Royal Society.\n【38】 The campus supports a number of research centers including: the Information Center for the Environment, the Center for Visual Sciences, the  Advanced Highway Maintenance Construction Technology Research Laboratory, the  University of California Pavement Research Center, among others. The campus maintains a web site that publishes information and supports discussion about its research activities.\n【39】 ## Rankings\n【40】 In terms of Graduate Studies rankings, in 2006 U.S. News & World Report placed UC Davis First Nationally in Ecology and Evolution.\n【41】 In 2006, UC Davis was ranked 42nd in the world and 34th in the Americas by an annual listing of the Top 500 World Universities published by the Institute of Higher Education in Shanghai, China. In 2006, UC Davis was ranked 170th in the world by 2006 The Times Higher Education Supplement Rankings.\n【42】 In 2007 U.S. News and World Report ranked UC Davis as the 42nd best university in the United States, the 11th best public university in the U.S., and the 4th best of the UC schools (after Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD). UC Davis  ranked in the top 4 public universities in California.  The Washington Monthly ranked UC Davis 8th in its 2007 National College Ranking, which focuses on level of contribution to the nation (through fostering social mobility, research, and service).\n【43】 ## Admissions\n【44】 Admission to UC Davis is very selective. For Fall 2007, 20,452 freshmen were admitted out of an application pool of 35,125 for a freshman acceptance rate of 58.2%. On average, admitted students earned a high school GPA of 3.89, SAT Critical Reasoning score of 601, SAT Mathematics score of 637, SAT Writing score of 607, and ACT composite score of 26.\n【45】 # Student life\n【46】 ## Athletics\n【47】 The UC Davis Aggies (or Ags) compete in NCAA Division I sports in the Big West Conference. For football, the Aggies compete in Division I FCS (formerly known as Division I-AA), and are members of the Great West Football Conference. The Aggies are  members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in gymnastics and lacrosse, the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association in rowing, and an associate member of the Pacific Ten Conference in wrestling.\n【48】 The Aggies finished first in NCAA Division II six times in 2003 and won the NACDA Director's Cup 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003. In 1998, the UC Davis men's basketball team won the NCAA Division II national championship despite being one of the few non-scholarship institutions in Division II at that time. These and other achievements motivated a decision (following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and the local community) in 2003 for the athletics program to re-classify to Division I.\n【49】 The highlight of the recent 4-year transition to Division I occurred on September 17, 2005, when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium by a score of 20-17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game. The Aggies  pulled off an upset against Stanford in basketball just months later, beating the Cardinal 64-58 with a late rally at home on December 4, 2005. The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies' win loss record with Stanford to 5-1 for men's sports the 05-06 year.\n【50】 The Aggie football team plays California State University, Sacramento in the annual Causeway Classic for the Causeway Carriage. The team  plays Cal Poly in the annual Battle for the Golden Horseshoe for the Golden Horseshoe (trophy). UC Davis students gather at sporting events to rally as the Aggie Pack, the largest student-run school spirit organization in the United States. The Aggie Pack cheers on the sports team to the music of the Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! and its alumni band. Aggie Stadium is the home of the UC Davis football and lacrosse teams.\n【51】 The official school colors are blue and gold. The blue is due to the UC's early connection to Yale and as a result is often referred to as \"Yale Blue\" (e.g., see  and ), although UCD's official blue (sometimes called \"Aggie Blue\", Pantone 295 differs from Yale Blue (approximately Pantone .\n【52】 The official school mascot is the mustang. Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school's agricultural heritage. Unlike most colleges, there is a distinction between the name for students and the mascot. There was a movement to change the school's mascot from the mustang to the cow, but despite student support this was turned down after opposition from alumni. Many people will call the mustang mascot of UC Davis an Aggie, but this is not its proper name; the mustang mascot is named Gunrock. The name dates to 1921 when the US Army brought a horse named Gun Rock to UC Davis to supply high-quality stock for cavalry horses. The mustang mascot was selected to honor that cavalry horse.\n【53】 ## School Songs\n【54】 Aggie Fight - The fight song.\n【55】 Composer: Larry Austin\n【56】 Lift up your voices, now's the time to sing.\n【57】 This is the day the Victory Bell will ring.\n【58】 Loyal Aggies, all for one,\n【59】 Never stopping 'till we've won.\n【60】 Because the Mustang will show our team the way to fight,\n【61】 Charging the enemy with all his might.\n【62】 Let's go. Let's win. Today's the day,\n【63】 The Aggies will fight! Fight!

Loyall McLaren\n【77】 Arrangement: William Denny\n【78】 We are Sons of California,\n【79】 fighting for the Gold and Blue.\n【80】 Palms of glory we will win\n【81】 for Alma Mater true.\n【82】 Sac State's men will soon be routed,\n【83】 by our dazzling C.\n【84】 We'll stomp 'em in the mud,\n【85】 their green will turn to blood,\n【86】 in our hour of victory!\n【87】 Hail to California - The UC Alma Mater.\n【88】 Composer: Clinton Morse\n【89】 Arrangement: Charles Cushing\n【90】 Hail to California, Alma Mater dear.\n【91】 Sing the joyful chorus, sound it far and near.\n【92】 Rally 'round her banner, we will never fail.\n【93】 California, Alma Mater,\n【94】 Hail! Hail! Hail!\n【95】 ## Traditions and student activities\n【96】 Picnic Day, UC Davis's annual Open House, is the largest student-run event in the United States. It attracts thousands of visitors each year with its many attractions. These include a parade, a magic show performed by the chemistry department, the Doxie Derby (dachshund races), film screenings, and a Battle of the Bands between the Band-uh! and other college bands including the Cal Band, the Stanford Band, and the Humboldt State Marching Band.\n【97】 Another highlight of UC Davis is its student-run freeform radio station, KDVS. The station began operations on February 1, 1964 from the laundry room of the all-male dormitory Beckett Hall. The station soon gained a reputation by airing interviews with Angela Davis and a live call-in show with then California Governor Ronald Reagan in 1969. The station can now be heard on 90.3 FM and online at their website .\n【98】 The undergraduate student government of UC Davis is the Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD), and has an annual operating budget of 9.7 million dollars, making it the highest funded student government in the United States. UC Davis  has some 400 registered student organizations.\n【99】 The Letters and Science Graduate Students are represented by the Graduate Student Association (GSA).\n【100】 ## Greek life\n【101】 Social fraternities and sororities have been a part of the University of California at Davis since 1923. Approximately 8% of the university's undergraduate students are involved in the school's fraternities and sororities. One sorority, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi, was featured during the first season of the MTV reality show \"Sorority Life.\"\n【102】 Fraternities and sororities provide a small group living experience that enhances the co-curricular life of every Greek student through academic, social, educational, leadership, and community service activities. There are both national and local fraternities and sororities at UCD with diverse backgrounds and histories.\n【103】 Collegiate Pan-Hellenic sororities\n【104】 - Alpha Chi Omega AXΩ\n【105】 - Alpha Phi AΦ\n【106】 - Chi Omega XΩ\n【107】 - Delta Delta Delta ΔΔΔ\n【108】 - Delta Gamma ΔΓ\n【109】 - Kappa Alpha Theta KAΘ\n【110】 - Kappa Kappa Gamma KKΓ\n【111】 - Pi Beta Phi ΠBΦ\n【112】 National Interfraternity Conference fraternities\n【113】 - Alpha Epsilon Pi ΑΕΠ (AEPi)\n【114】 - Alpha Gamma Omega ΑΓΩ (AGO)\n【115】 - Chi Phi XΦ\n【116】 - Delta Chi ΔX\n【117】 - Delta Lambda Phi\n【118】 - Delta Sigma Phi ΔΣΦ\n【119】 - Delta Kappa Epsilon ΔKE\n【120】 - Lambda Chi Alpha ΛXA\n【121】 - Lambda Phi Epsilon ΛΦE\n【122】 - Pi Alpha Phi ΠΑΦ\n【123】 - Pi Kappa Alpha ΠΚΑ (Pike)\n【124】 - Phi Kappa Psi ΦKΨ\n【125】 - Psi Chi Omega ΨXΩ\n【126】 - Sigma Alpha Epsilon ΣΑΕ (SAE)\n【127】 - Sigma Alpha Mu ΣΑΜ (Sammy)\n【128】 - Sigma Chi ΣX\n【129】 - Sigma Phi Epsilon ΣΦΕ (Sig Ep)\n【130】 - Tau Kappa Epsilon TKE\n【131】 - Theta Chi ΘX\n【132】 - Theta Xi ΘΞ\n【133】 Multi-cultural fraternities and sororities\n【134】 - Delta Xi Phi ΔΞΦ\n【135】 - Epsilon Sigma Rho ΕΣΡ\n【136】 - Lambda Sigma Gamma ΛΣΓ\n【137】 - Sigma Alpha Zeta ΣΑΖ\n【138】 - Chi Rho Omicron ΧΡΟ\n【139】 National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations\n【140】 - Gamma Zeta Alpha ΓΖΑ\n【141】 - Lambda Theta Nu ΛΘΝ\n【142】 - Lambda Theta Phi ΛΘΦ\n【143】 - Nu Alpha Kappa NAK\n【144】 - Sigma Lambda Beta ΣΛB\n【145】 - Sigma Lambda Gamma ΣΛΓ\n【146】 African American Greek Letter Council\n【147】 - Omega Psi Phi ΩΨΦ\n【148】 - Kappa Alpha Psi KAΨ\n【149】 - Sigma Gamma Rho ΣΓP\n【150】 - Phi Beta Sigma ΦBΣ\n【151】 - Delta Sigma ThetaΔΣΘ\n【152】 - Alpha Kappa Alpha AKA\n【153】 # Transportation\n【154】 UC Davis is famous for its large number of bicycles and bicyclists. The city of Davis boasts the highest number of bikes per capita of any U.S. city. Bicyclists are ubiquitous around campus as well as the city, and thus a lot of bike-only infrastructure exists, such as bike circles, large bike lanes, and traffic signals exclusively for bikes. The police department  has some of its officers patrol on bicycles. Furthermore, the police take bicycling under the influence (\"BUI\") and bicycling without a headlight at night very seriously, both of which are punishable by a traffic ticket. All bikes on the UC Davis campus must be registered with a California Bicycle license.\n【155】 UC Davis is  well known for its bus service, Unitrans, and their trademark London double decker buses. It has been in operation since 1968 and is believed to be the only general purpose (non-sightseeing) transit system in the U.S. to operate vintage double deck buses in daily service. The system is operated and managed entirely by students and offers fixed-route transportation throughout the city. There is  an inter-campus bus service that ferries back and forth between UC Davis and UC Berkeley twice daily, from Monday to Friday.\n【156】 UC Davis is bounded by freeways on two sides (Highway 113 and Interstate . All other UC campuses are either somewhat distant from the closest freeway or are directly adjacent to only one freeway. Two freeway exits are entirely within UCD's boundaries. One, off Highway 113, is signed \"UC Davis / Hutchison Drive\" and the other, off Interstate 80, is signed exclusively as \"UC Davis.\"\n【157】 Easy freeway access, coupled with increasing housing costs in the city of Davis, have led to increased numbers of students commuting via automobile. Some students choose to live in the neighboring communities of Sacramento, Dixon or Woodland, and use their own cars or the county-wide Yolobus to get to UC Davis.\n【158】 # Notable people at UC Davis\n【159】 - List of UC Davis alumni\n【160】 - List of UC Davis faculty\n", "seq_id": 9338, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-17 19:53:46"}

Common adverse reactions include raised intraocular pressure.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 - Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period, followed by 2 times daily for a week and then a taper based on the response.\n【8】 - Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily for 14 days followed by tapering as clinically indicated.\n【9】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【10】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【11】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Difluprednate in adult patients.\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【13】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Difluprednate in adult patients.\n【14】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【15】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【16】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Difluprednate in pediatric patients.\n【17】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【18】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【19】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Difluprednate in pediatric patients.\n【20】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【21】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Difluprednate in pediatric patients.\n【22】 # Contraindications\n【23】 - The use of DUREZOL, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and  in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures.\n【24】 # Warnings\n【25】 ### Precautions\n【26】 - IOP Increase\n【27】 - Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored.\n【28】 - Cataracts\n【29】 - Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation.\n【30】 - Delayed Healing\n【31】 - The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 28 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.\n【32】 - Bacterial Infections\n【33】 - Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated.\n【34】 - Viral Infections\n【35】 - Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).\n【36】 - Fungal Infections\n【37】 - Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate.\n【38】 - Topical Ophthalmic Use Only\n【39】 - DUREZOL is not indicated for intraocular administration.\n【40】 - Contact Lens Wear\n【41】 - DUREZOL should not be instilled while wearing contact lenses. Remove contact lenses prior to instillation of DUREZOL. The preservative in DUREZOL may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Lenses may be reinserted after 10 minutes following administration of DUREZOL.\n【42】 # Adverse Reactions\n【43】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【44】 - Ocular Surgery\n【45】 - Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5-15% of subjects in clinical studies with DUREZOL included corneal edema, ciliary and conjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, photophobia, posterior capsule opacification, anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, conjunctival edema, and blepharitis.  Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in 1-5% of subjects included reduced visual acuity, punctate keratitis, eye inflammation, and iritis.  Ocular adverse reactions occurring in < 1% of subjects included application site discomfort or irritation, corneal pigmentation and striae, episcleritis, eye pruritis, eyelid irritation and crusting, foreign body sensation, increased lacrimation, macular edema, sclera hyperemia, and uveitis.  Most of these reactions may have been the consequence of the surgical procedure.\n【46】 - Endogenous Anterior Uveitis\n【47】 - A total of 200 subjects participated in the clinical trials for endogenous anterior uveitis, of which 106 were exposed to DUREZOL.  The most common adverse reactions of those exposed to DUREZOL occurring in 5-10% of subjects included blurred vision, eye irritation, eye pain, headache, increased IOP, iritis, limbal and conjunctival hyperemia, punctate keratitis, and uveitis.  Adverse reactions occurring in 2-5% of subjects included anterior chamber flare, corneal edema, dry eye, iridocyclitis, photophobia, and reduced visual acuity.\n【48】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【49】 There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Difluprednate in the drug label.\n【50】 # Drug Interactions\n【51】 There is limited information regarding Difluprednate Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n【52】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【53】 ### Pregnancy\n【54】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【55】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【56】 - Difluprednate has been shown to be embryotoxic (decrease in embryonic body weight and a delay in embryonic ossification) and teratogenic (cleft palate and skeletal anomalies) when administered subcutaneously to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 1-10 mcg/kg/day. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 1 mcg/kg/day, and 10 mcg/kg/day was considered to be a teratogenic dose that was concurrently found in the toxic dose range for fetuses and pregnant females. Treatment of rats with 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity, nor was it maternally toxic. At 100 mcg/kg/day after subcutaneous administration in rats, there was a decrease in fetal weights and delay in ossification, and effects on weight gain in the pregnant females. It is difficult to extrapolate these doses of difluprednate to maximum daily human doses of DUREZOL, since DUREZOL is administered topically with minimal systemic absorption, and difluprednate blood levels were not measured in the reproductive animal studies. However, since use of difluprednate during human pregnancy has not been evaluated and cannot rule out the possibility of harm, DUREZOL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus.\n【57】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【58】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【59】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Difluprednate in women who are pregnant.\n【60】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【61】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Difluprednate during labor and delivery.\n【62】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【63】 - It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when DUREZOL is administered to a nursing woman.\n【64】 ### Pediatric Use\n【65】 - DUREZOL was evaluated in a 3-month, multicenter, double-masked trial in 79 pediatric patients (39 DUREZOL; 40 prednisolone acetate) 0 to 3 years of age for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery.  A similar safety profile was observed in pediatric patients comparing DUREZOL to prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension, 1%.\n【66】 ### Geriatic Use\n【67】 - No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.\n【68】 ### Gender\n【69】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Difluprednate with respect to specific gender populations.\n【70】 ### Race\n【71】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Difluprednate with respect to specific racial populations.\n【72】 ### Renal Impairment\n【73】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Difluprednate in patients with renal impairment.\n【74】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【75】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Difluprednate in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【76】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【77】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Difluprednate in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【78】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【79】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Difluprednate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【80】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【81】 ### Administration\n【82】 - Topical\n【83】 ### Monitoring\n【84】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Difluprednate in the drug label.\n【85】 # IV Compatibility\n【86】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Difluprednate in the drug label.\n【87】 # Overdosage\n【88】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【89】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Difluprednate in the drug label.\n【90】 # Pharmacology\n【91】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【92】 - Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and may delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotreines by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.\n【93】 - Difluprednate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids.\n【94】 ## Structure\n【95】 - DUREZOL (difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion) 0.05% is a sterile, topical anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for ophthalmic use. The chemical name is 6α,9difluoro-11β,17,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 21-acetate 17-butyrate (CAS number 23674-86-. Difluprednate is represented by the following structural formula:\n【96】 - Difluprednate has a molecular weight of 508.56, and the empirical formula is C27H34F2O7.\n【97】 - Each mL contains: ACTIVE: difluprednate 0.5 mg (0.05%); INACTIVE: boric acid, castor oil, glycerin, polysorbate 80, water for injection, sodium acetate, sodium EDTA, sodium hydroxide (to adjust the pH to 5.2 to 5.. The emulsion is essentially isotonic with a tonicity of 304 to 411 mOsm/kg. PRESERVATIVE: sorbic acid 0.1%.\n【98】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【99】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Difluprednate in the drug label.\n【100】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【101】 - Difluprednate undergoes deacetylation in vivo to 6α, 9-difluoroprednisolone 17-butyrate (DFB), an active metabolite of difluprednate.\n【102】 - Clinical pharmacokinetic studies of difluprednate after repeat ocular instillation of 2 drops of difluprednate (0.01% or 0.05%) four times per day for 7 days showed that DFB levels in blood were below the quantification limit (50 ng/mL) at all time points for all subjects, indicating the systemic absorption of difluprednate after ocular instillation of DUREZOL is limited.\n【103】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【104】 - Difluprednate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, and in cultured mammalian cells CHL/IU (a fibroblastic cell line derived from the lungs of newborn female Chinese hamsters). An in vivo micronucleus test of difluprednate in mice was  negative. Treatment of male and female rats with subcutaneous difluprednate up to 10 mcg/kg/day prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Long term studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of difluprednate.\n【105】 - In multiple studies performed in rodents and non-rodents, subchronic and chronic toxicity tests of difluprednate showed systemic effects such as suppression of body weight gain; a decrease in lymphocyte count; atrophy of the lymphatic glands and adrenal gland; and for local effects, thinning of the skin; all of which were due to the pharmacologic action of the molecule and are well known glucocorticosteroid effects. Most, if not all of these effects were reversible after drug withdrawal. The NOEL for the subchronic and chronic toxicity tests were consistent between species and ranged from 1-1.25 mcg/kg/day.\n【106】 # Clinical Studies\n【107】 - Ocular Surgery\n【108】 - Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials in which subjects with an anterior chamber cell grade ≥ \"2\" (a cell count of 11 or higher) after cataract surgery were assigned to DUREZOL or placebo (vehicle) following surgery. One drop of DUREZOL or vehicle was self instilled either 2 times per day or 4 times per day for 14 days, beginning the day after surgery. The presence of complete clearing (a cell count of  was assessed 8 and 15 days post-surgery using a slit lamp binocular microscope. In the intent-to-treat analyses of both studies, a significant benefit was seen in the 4 times per day DUREZOL-treated group in ocular inflammation and reduction of pain when compared with placebo. The consolidated clinical trial results are provided below.\n【109】 - Endogenous Anterior Uveitis\n【110】 - Clinical efficacy was evaluated in two randomized, double masked active controlled trials in which patients who presented with endogenous anterior uveitis were treated with either DUREZOL 4 times daily or prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension, 1%, 8 times daily for 14 days.  Both studies demonstrated that DUREZOL was equally effective as prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension, 1% in treating subjects with endogenous anterior uveitis.\n【111】 # How Supplied\n【112】 - DUREZOL (difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion) 0.05% is a sterile, aqueous topical ophthalmic emulsion supplied in an opaque plastic bottle with a controlled drop tip and a pink cap in the following sizes:\n【113】 - 5 mL in a 8 mL bottle (NDC 0065-9240-\n【114】 - 5 mL in a 7.5 mL bottle (NDC 0065-9240-\n【115】 - Storage and Handling\n【116】 - Store at 15-25°C (59-77°F).

Beside percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV), surgical treatments for mitral stenosis include closed commissurotomy, open commissurotomy (valve repair) and mitral valve replacement. In open surgery, the surgeon makes a large cut in the sternum to reach the heart. Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is done through much smaller surgical cuts than the large cuts needed for open surgery.\n【3】 # Indications\n【4】 Although mitral valvuloplasty is an effective less invasive treatment modality compared to surgery, mitral valve surgery is indicated if the mitral valve is severely calcified, if there is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation coexists with MS, if mitral valvuloplasty is not available or the patient has unfavorable valve morphology, and if there is left atrial thrombus that persists despite anticoagulation.\n【5】 # Pre-operative Evaluation\n【6】 The patient may need to have some tests before the procedure. The cardiologist usually conducts a physical examination and diagnose the condition within few days, he or she will assess the general health of the patient and will recommend the most appropriate treatment for the patient and if he or she needs surgery.\n【7】 # Surgical Procedure\n【8】 The surgery for mitral valve stenosis can be done either by the traditional open heart surgery or by the minimally invasive surgery. Before the surgery, the patient will receive general anesthesia. This causes the patient to be asleep and pain-free during the entire procedure. Beside percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV); there are three approaches for mitral stenosis surgical treatment.\n【9】 # Recovery\n【10】 The amount of time needed for recovery will depend on the complexity of the procedure, and whether there are any complications. The patient should be closely monitored during the recovery period, whether they are in the hospital, at home, or are being seen in the outpatient setting.\n【11】 # Outcomes and Prognosis\n【12】 The results of mitral valve stenosis surgery are excellent in centers that regularly perform this surgery.\n【13】 # Complications\n【14】 Mitral valve surgery carries the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as DVT, post-operative infections, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. The risks that are specific to open-heart surgery are; heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias, and sternal wound infections. Prosthetic heart valves themselves are  associated with a number of complications.\n", "seq_id": 8623, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 00:58:12"}

Depending on the indication, it is often combined with tonsillectomy and/or grommet insertion.\n【6】 Traditional adenoidectomy is carried out by 'cold' curettage. A potential problem with this technique is persistent bleeding, which may require control by electrocautery or packing of the nasopharynx.\n【7】 # Outline of the procedure\n【8】 Suction diathermy adenoidectomy ( known as suction electrocautery or suction coagulation) aims to remove the adenoids while minimising intraoperative blood loss and risk of secondary haemorrhage. It involves the use of heat generated by an electric current to ablate or liquefy adenoid tissue, which is then removed using suction.\n【9】 The procedure is performed with the patient under general anaesthesia. Direct (using a mirror) or endoscopic visualisation is used. A suction diathermy probe (coagulator) is passed into the mouth and applied to the adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx, to liquefy and remove it. The procedure is considered to be complete when the choanae are clearly visible and the nasopharynx has a smooth contour.\n【10】 Several different devices are available for this procedure, which may require different diathermy settings to minimise the risk of heat damage.\n【11】 Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n【12】 # Efficacy\n【13】 A meta-analysis of 2252 patients reported a subjective success rate (definition varied for each study) for 1812 patients treated by suction diathermy across 6 studies of 95% (1721/1812; 95% confidence interval  92.7 to 97.3; p < 0..\n【14】 A randomised controlled trial of 100 patients treated by suction diathermy or by curettage reported that suction diathermy-treated patients had significantly fewer Wormald and Prescott grade 3 remnant adenoids than patients treated by curettage at 6-month follow-up (p = 0. (scale ranges from grade 1  to grade .\n【15】 A prospective audit of 126 patients treated by suction diathermy or by curettage used a scale from 0 (best) to 6 (worst) to measure nasal obstruction, loudness and frequency of snoring, duration of coloured rhinorrhoea and presence of irregular sleep patterns. It reported significantly lower mean postoperative symptom scores after both treatments (0.4 and 0.7, respectively) compared with mean preoperative scores (3.3 and 3.0, respectively) (p < 0.001 for both groups). No significant difference in mean symptom score change from baseline was reported between the 2 treatment groups (absolute figures not stated) (p = 0..\n【16】 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as reduced blood loss (especially important in small children), completeness of adenoidectomy and relief of symptoms (for example, infection and obstructive sleep apnoea).\n【17】 # Safety\n【18】 In the meta-analysis of 2522 patients treated by suction diathermy or curettage, mean intraoperative blood loss was 4.31 ml (95% CI 0.4 to 8.2; p = 0.03; 5 studies, n =  and 24.00 ml (95% CI 0 to 48.3; p = 0.052; 3 studies, n = , respectively.\n【19】 A non-randomised controlled trial of 149 patients reported no (0/ postoperative bleeding episodes in patients treated by suction diathermy compared with 10% (7/ in those treated by curettage (p < 0.. In the prospective audit of 126 patients, secondary bleeds (defined in the paper as pink-stained nasal discharge) were reported in 4% (3/ of patients treated by suction diathermy and in 2% (1/ of those treated by curettage (no intervention required).\n【20】 Postoperative neck stiffness was reported in a non-randomised controlled trial of 276 patients treated by suction diathermy, curettage, or microdebrider adenoidectomy to have occurred in 9% (8/, 10% (8/ and 17% (17/ of patients, respectively (p = 0.08, not stated if 'overall' or pair-wise comparison).\n【21】 Grisel's syndrome was reported in 1 patient in the retrospective study of 1206 patients and 1 patient in a case report. One of these patients had torticollis and type I atlantoaxial subluxation which resolved in 3 weeks and the other patient had a reduced range of neck movement at 9-month follow-up. Retropharyngeal fluid collection resulting in neck stiffness and low-grade fever was reported in 1 patient in the retrospective study of 1206 patients.\n【22】 Cervical osteomyelitis was reported in 1 patient after suction electrocautery, in a case report: this resolved completely after 4 weeks of medical therapy.\n【23】 Velopharyngeal insufficiency (improper closing of the soft palate against the posterior pharyngeal wall during speech and swallowing) was reported in 16 patients in the case series of 1206 patients: this resolved within 6 months in all but 1 patient, in whom it persisted for more than 2 years. The prospective audit reported that 4% (3/ of patients treated by suction diathermy had transient velopharyngeal insufficiency compared with 7% (4/ of patients treated by curettage: it resolved in all 7 patients within 2–4 weeks.\n【24】 The Specialist Advisers considered theoretical adverse events to include Grisel's syndrome, thermal damage or burns to the nasopharynx and surrounding structures from diathermy, scarring and infection.# Further information\n【25】 For related NICE guidance see our website.\n【26】 # Information for patients\n【27】 NICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\n【28】 NICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【29】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【30】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is  available.\n【31】 Changes since publication\n【32】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【33】 Your responsibility\n【34】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【35】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【36】 \n【37】 \n【38】 \n", "seq_id": 2553, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "", "type3": "无关文本#3#3#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#11#11#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#24#24#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#25#35#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 02:01:42"}

Common adverse reactions include unpleasant taste, headache, somnolence, respiratory infection, dizziness, dry mouth, rash, anxiety, hallucinations, and viral infections.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 - Dosing Information\n【8】 - Dosage in Adults\n【9】 - The recommended starting dose is 1 mg. Dosing can be raised to 2 mg or 3 mg if clinically indicated. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels of LUNESTA following use of the 2 mg or 3 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness. The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 3 mg, once daily immediately before bedtime.\n【10】 - Geriatric or Debilitated Patients\n【11】 - The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.\n【12】 - Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment, or Taking Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n【13】 - In patients with severe hepatic impairment, or in patients coadministered LUNESTA with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg.\n【14】 - Use with CNS Depressants\n【15】 - Dosage adjustments may be necessary when LUNESTA is combined with other CNS depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects.\n【16】 - Administration with Food\n【17】 - Taking LUNESTA with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of LUNESTA on sleep latency.\n【18】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【19】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【20】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Eszopiclone in adult patients.\n【21】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 - Dosing Information\n【23】 - Eszopiclone 3 mg prior to polysomnography.\n【24】 - Dosing Information\n【25】 - Eszopiclone 3 mg each night for 8 weeks.\n【26】 - Dosing Information\n【27】 - Eszopiclone 3 mg for 8 weeks.\n【28】 - Dosing Information\n【29】 - Eszopiclone 3 mg per day.\n【30】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【31】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【32】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Eszopiclone in pediatric patients.\n【33】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【34】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【35】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Eszopiclone in pediatric patients.\n【36】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【37】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Eszopiclone in pediatric patients.\n【38】 # Contraindications\n【39】 - LUNESTA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to eszopiclone. Hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis and angioedema.\n【40】 # Warnings\n【41】 ### Precautions\n【42】 - CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment\n【43】 - Eszopiclone is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients at the higher doses (2 mg or 3 mg), even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of symptoms (or even with subjective improvement), and impairment may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of eszopiclone may develop, patients using 3 mg eszopiclone should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.\n【44】 - Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use. Downward dose adjustment of eszopiclone and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered.\n【45】 - The use of eszopiclone with other sedative-hypnotics at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended.\n【46】 - The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if eszopiclone is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7- to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if co- administered with other CNS depressants; or co-administered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of eszopiclone.\n【47】 - Need to Evaluate for Co-Morbid Diagnoses\n【48】 - Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including eszopiclone. Because some of the important adverse effects of eszopiclone appear to be dose-related, it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.\n【49】 - Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions\n【50】 - Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with eszopiclone should not be rechallenged with the drug.\n【51】 - Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes\n【52】 - A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seem out of character), similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS depressants. Other reported behavioral changes have included bizarre behavior, agitation, hallucinations, and depersonalization. Amnesia and other neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics.\n【53】 - Complex behaviors such as “sleep-driving” (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naïve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with eszopiclone alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with eszopiclone appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of eszopiclone at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of eszopiclone should be strongly considered for patients who report a “sleep-driving” episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.\n【54】 - It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above are drug-induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.\n【55】 - Withdrawal Effects\n【56】 - Following rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of the use of sedative/hypnotics, there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs.\n【57】 - Timing of Drug Administration\n【58】 - Eszopiclone should be taken immediately before bedtime. Taking a sedative/hypnotic while still up and about may result in short-term memory impairment, hallucinations, impaired coordination, dizziness, and lightheadedness.\n【59】 - Special Populations\n【60】 - Use in Elderly and/or Debilitated Patients\n【61】 Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. The dose should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.\n【62】 - Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. The dose should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.\n【63】 - Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness\n【64】 Clinical experience with eszopiclone in patients with concomitant illness is limited. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.\n【65】 A study in healthy volunteers did not reveal respiratory-depressant effects at doses 2.5-fold higher (7 mg) than the recommended dose of eszopiclone. Caution is advised, however, if eszopiclone is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function.\n【66】 The dose of eszopiclone should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment, because systemic exposure is doubled in such subjects. No dose adjustment appears necessary for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment appears necessary in subjects with any degree of renal impairment, since less than 10% of eszopiclone is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n【67】 The dose of eszopiclone should be reduced in patients who are administered potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, while taking eszopiclone. Downward dose adjustment is  recommended when eszopiclone is administered with agents having known CNS-depressant effects.\n【68】 - Clinical experience with eszopiclone in patients with concomitant illness is limited. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.\n【69】 - A study in healthy volunteers did not reveal respiratory-depressant effects at doses 2.5-fold higher (7 mg) than the recommended dose of eszopiclone. Caution is advised, however, if eszopiclone is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function.\n【70】 - The dose of eszopiclone should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment, because systemic exposure is doubled in such subjects. No dose adjustment appears necessary for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment appears necessary in subjects with any degree of renal impairment, since less than 10% of eszopiclone is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n【71】 - The dose of eszopiclone should be reduced in patients who are administered potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, while taking eszopiclone. Downward dose adjustment is  recommended when eszopiclone is administered with agents having known CNS-depressant effects.\n【72】 - Use in Patients with Depression\n【73】 Sedative/hypnotic drugs should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of depression. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients, and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.\n【74】 - Sedative/hypnotic drugs should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of depression. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients, and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.\n【75】 # Adverse Reactions\n【76】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【77】 - Adverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of Treatment\n【78】 - In placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in the elderly, 3.8% of 208 patients who received placebo, 2.3% of 215 patients who received 2 mg eszopiclone, and 1.4% of 72 patients who received 1 mg eszopiclone discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. In the 6‑week parallel-group study in adults, no patients in the 3 mg arm discontinued because of an adverse reaction. In the long-term 6-month study in adult insomnia patients, 7.2% of 195 patients who received placebo and 12.8% of 593 patients who received 3 mg eszopiclone discontinued due to an adverse reaction. No reaction that resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate of greater than 2%.\n【79】 - Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of ≥2% in Controlled Trials\n【80】 -  shows the incidence of adverse reactions from a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study of eszopiclone at doses of 2 or 3 mg in non-elderly adults. Treatment duration in this trial was 44 days. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg or 3 mg in which the incidence in patients treated with eszopiclone was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.\n【81】 - Adverse reactions from  that suggest a dose-response relationship in adults include viral infection, dry mouth, dizziness, hallucinations, infection, rash, and unpleasant taste, with this relationship clearest for unpleasant taste.\n【82】 -  shows the incidence of adverse reactions from combined Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies of eszopiclone at doses of 1 or 2 mg in elderly adults (ages 65 to . Treatment duration in these trials was 14 days. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with eszopiclone 1 mg or 2 mg in which the incidence in patients treated with eszopiclone was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.\n【83】 - Adverse reactions from  that suggest a dose-response relationship in elderly adults include pain, dry mouth, and unpleasant taste, with this relationship again clearest for unpleasant taste.\n【84】 - These figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse reactions in the course of usual medical practice because patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse reaction incidence rate in the population studied.\n【85】 - Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Eszopiclone\n【86】 - Following is a list of modified COSTART terms that reflect adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the Adverse Reactions section and reported by approximately 1550 subjects treated with eszopiclone at doses in the range of 1 to 3.5 mg/day during Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials throughout the United States and Canada. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Tables 1 and 2 or elsewhere in labeling, minor reactions common in the general population, and reactions unlikely to be drug-related. Although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with eszopiclone, they were not necessarily caused by it.\n【87】 - Reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those that occurred on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/100 patients but in at least 1/1,000 patients; rare adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Gender-specific reactions are categorized based on their incidence for the appropriate gender.\n【88】 - Body as a Whole: Frequent: chest pain; Infrequent: allergic reaction, cellulitis, face edema, fever, halitosis, heat stroke, hernia, malaise, neck rigidity, photosensitivity.\n【89】 - Cardiovascular System: Frequent: migraine; Infrequent: hypertension; Rare: thrombophlebitis.\n【90】 - Digestive System: Infrequent: anorexia, cholelithiasis, increased appetite, melena, mouth ulceration, thirst, ulcerative stomatitis; Rare: colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, liver damage, stomach ulcer, stomatitis, tongue edema, rectal hemorrhage.\n【91】 - Hemic and Lymphatic System: Infrequent: anemia, lymphadenopathy.\n【92】 - Metabolic and Nutritional: Frequent: peripheral edema; Infrequent: hypercholesteremia, weight gain, weight loss; Rare: dehydration, gout, hyperlipemia, hypokalemia.\n【93】 - Musculoskeletal System: Infrequent: arthritis, bursitis, joint disorder (mainly swelling, stiffness, and pain), leg cramps, myasthenia, twitching; Rare: arthrosis, myopathy, ptosis.\n【94】 - Nervous System: Infrequent: agitation, apathy, ataxia, emotional lability, hostility, hypertonia, hypesthesia, incoordination, insomnia, memory impairment, neurosis, nystagmus, paresthesia, reflexes decreased, thinking abnormal (mainly difficulty concentrating), vertigo; Rare: abnormal gait, euphoria, hyperesthesia, hypokinesia, neuritis, neuropathy, stupor, tremor.\n【95】 - Respiratory System: Infrequent: asthma, bronchitis, dyspnea, epistaxis, hiccup, laryngitis.\n【96】 - Skin and Appendages: Infrequent: acne, alopecia, contact dermatitis, dry skin, eczema, skin discoloration, sweating, urticaria; Rare: erythema multiforme, furunculosis, herpes zoster, hirsutism, maculopapular rash, vesiculobullous rash.\n【97】 - Special Senses: Infrequent: conjunctivitis, dry eyes, ear pain, otitis externa, otitis media, tinnitus, vestibular disorder; Rare: hyperacusis, iritis, mydriasis, photophobia.\n【98】 - Urogenital System: Infrequent: amenorrhea, breast engorgement, breast enlargement, breast neoplasm, breast pain, cystitis, dysuria, female lactation, hematuria, kidney calculus, kidney pain, mastitis, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, uterine hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginitis; Rare: oliguria, pyelonephritis, urethritis.\n【99】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【100】 - In addition to the adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, dysosmia, an olfactory dysfunction that is characterized by distortion of the sense of smell, has been reported during post-marketing surveillance with eszopiclone. Because this event is reported spontaneously from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to estimate the frequency of this event.\n【101】 # Drug Interactions\n【102】 - CNS Active Drugs\n【103】 - Ethanol: An additive effect on psychomotor performance was seen with coadministration of eszopiclone and ethanol.\n【104】 - Olanzapine: Coadministration of eszopiclone and olanzapine produced a decrease in DSST scores. The interaction was pharmacodynamic; there was no alteration in the pharmacokinetics of either drug.\n【105】 - Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4\n【106】 - Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 (Ketoconazole): CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone. The exposure of eszopiclone was increased by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly. Dose reduction of eszopiclone is needed for patient co-administered eszopiclone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n【107】 - Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin): Racemic zopiclone exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant use of rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4. A similar effect would be expected with eszopiclone. Combination use with CYP3A4 inducer may decrease exposure and effects of eszopiclone\n【108】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【109】 ### Pregnancy\n【110】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【111】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【112】 - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Eszopiclone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n【113】 - Oral administration of eszopiclone to pregnant rats (62.5, 125, or 250 mg/kg/day) and rabbits  of 3 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. No effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits; the highest dose tested is approximately 100 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.\n【114】 - Oral administration of eszopiclone  to pregnant rats throughout the pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased post-implantation loss, decreased postnatal pup weights and survival, and increased pup startle response at all doses. The lowest dose tested is approximately 200 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Eszopiclone had no effects on other developmental measures or reproductive function in the offspring.\n【115】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【116】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【117】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Eszopiclone in women who are pregnant.\n【118】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【119】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Eszopiclone during labor and delivery.\n【120】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【121】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eszopiclone with respect to nursing mothers.\n【122】 ### Pediatric Use\n【123】 - Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.\n【124】 - The labeling for Sunovion Pharmaceutical Inc.’s eszopiclone tablets includes additional information from a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in pediatric patients. However, due to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.\n【125】 - In studies in which eszopiclone (2 to 300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to young rats from weaning through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral impairment (altered auditory startle response) and reproductive toxicity (adverse effects on male reproductive organ weights and histopathology) were observed at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. Delayed sexual maturation was noted in males and females at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose (2 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for eszopiclone and metabolite (S)-desmethylzopiclone  approximately 2 times plasma exposures in humans at the maximum recommended dose (MRHD) in adults (3 mg/day).\n【126】 - When eszopiclone (doses from 1 to 50 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to young dogs from weaning through sexual maturity, neurotoxicity (convulsions) was observed at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular vacuolation and degeneration) and reproductive toxicity (adverse effects on male reproductive organ weights and histopathology) were noted at dose ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose (1 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to eszopiclone and (S)-DMZ approximately 3 and 2 times, respectively, plasma exposures in humans at the MRHD in adults.\n【127】 ### Geriatic Use\n【128】 - A total of 287 subjects in double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials who received eszopiclone were 65 to 86 years of age. The overall pattern of adverse events for elderly subjects (median age = 71 years) in 2-week studies with nighttime dosing of 2 mg eszopiclone was not different from that seen in younger adults. Eszopiclone 2 mg exhibited significant reduction in sleep latency and improvement in sleep maintenance in the elderly population. Compared with non-elderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had longer elimination and higher total exposure to eszopiclone. Therefore, dose reduction is recommended in the elderly patients.\n【129】 ### Gender\n【130】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eszopiclone with respect to specific gender populations.\n【131】 ### Race\n【132】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eszopiclone with respect to specific racial populations.\n【133】 ### Renal Impairment\n【134】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eszopiclone in patients with renal impairment.\n【135】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【136】 - No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure was increased in severely impaired patients compared with the healthy volunteers. The dose of eszopiclone should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【137】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【138】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eszopiclone in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【139】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【140】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Eszopiclone in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【141】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【142】 ### Administration\n【143】 - Oral\n【144】 ### Monitoring\n【145】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Eszopiclone in the drug label.\n【146】 # IV Compatibility\n【147】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Eszopiclone in the drug label.\n【148】 # Overdosage\n【149】 ## Acute Overdose\n【150】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n【151】 - Signs and symptoms of overdose effects of CNS depressants can be expected to present as exaggerations of the pharmacological effects noted in preclinical testing. Impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma has been described. Rare individual instances of fatal outcomes following overdose with racemic zopiclone have been reported in European postmarketing reports, most often associated with overdose with other CNS-depressant agents.\n【152】 ### Management\n【153】 - General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Flumazenil may be useful. As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined.\n【154】 - As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.\n【155】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【156】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Eszopiclone in the drug label.\n【157】 # Pharmacology\n【158】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【159】 - The precise mechanism of action of eszopiclone as a hypnotic is unknown, but its effect is believed to result from its interaction with GABA-receptor complexes at binding domains located close to or allosterically coupled to benzodiazepine receptors. Eszopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that is a pyrrolopyrazine derivative of the cyclopyrrolone class with a chemical structure unrelated to pyrazolopyrimidines, imidazopyridines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties.\n【160】 ## Structure\n【161】 - Eszopiclone Tablets are a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent that is a pyrrolopyrazine derivative of the cyclopyrrolone class. The chemical name of eszopiclone is (+)-(5S)-6-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo pyrazin-5-yl 4-methylpiperazine-1-carboxylate. Its molecular weight is 388.81, and its empirical formula is C17H17ClN6O3. Eszopiclone has a single chiral center with an (S)-configuration. It has the following chemical structure:\n【162】 - Eszopiclone is a white to light-yellow crystalline solid. Eszopiclone is very slightly soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, and soluble in phosphate buffer (pH 3..\n【163】 - Eszopiclone is formulated as film-coated tablets for oral administration. Eszopiclone Tablets contain 1 mg, 2 mg, or 3 mg eszopiclone and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose (anhydrous), magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, and triacetin.\n【164】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【165】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Eszopiclone in the drug label.\n【166】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【167】 - The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone have been investigated in healthy subjects (adult and elderly) and in patients with hepatic disease or renal disease. In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetic profile was examined after single doses of up to 7.5 mg and after once-daily administration of 1, 3, and 6 mg for 7 days. Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a time to peak concentration (tmax) of approximately 1 hour and a terminal-phase elimination half-life (t1/ of approximately 6 hours. In healthy adults, eszopiclone does not accumulate with once-daily administration, and its exposure is dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 6 mg.\n【168】 - Absorption and Distribution\n【169】 - Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately 1 hour after oral administration. Eszopiclone is weakly bound to plasma protein (52 to 59%). The large free fraction suggests that eszopiclone disposition should not be affected by drug-drug interactions caused by protein binding. The blood-to-plasma ratio for eszopiclone is less than one, indicating no selective uptake by red blood cells.\n【170】 - Metabolism\n【171】 - Following oral administration, eszopiclone is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. The primary plasma metabolites are (S)-zopiclone-N-oxide and (S)-N-desmethyl zopiclone; the latter compound binds to GABA receptors with substantially lower potency than eszopiclone, and the former compound shows no significant binding to this receptor. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of eszopiclone. Eszopiclone did not show any inhibitory potential on CYP450 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 in cryopreserved human hepatocytes.\n【172】 - Elimination\n【173】 - After oral administration, eszopiclone is eliminated with a mean t1/2 of approximately 6 hours. Up to 75% of an oral dose of racemic zopiclone is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. A similar excretion profile would be expected for eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.\n【174】 - Effect of Food\n【175】 - In healthy adults, administration of a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone after a high-fat meal resulted in no change in AUC, a reduction in mean Cmax of 21%, and delayed tmax by approximately 1 hour. The half-life remained unchanged, approximately 6 hours. The effects of eszopiclone on sleep onset may be reduced if it is taken with or immediately after a high-fat/heavy meal.\n【176】 - Specific Populations\n【177】 - Age\n【178】 - Compared with non-elderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had an increase of 41% in total exposure (AUC) and a slightly prolonged elimination of eszopiclone (t1/2 approximately 9 hours). Cmax was unchanged. Therefore, in elderly patients the dose should not exceed 2 mg.\n【179】 - Gender\n【180】 - The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone in men and women are similar.\n【181】 - Race\n【182】 - In an analysis of data on all subjects participating in Phase 1 studies of eszopiclone, the pharmacokinetics for all races studied appeared similar.\n【183】 - Hepatic Impairment\n【184】 - Pharmacokinetics of a 2 mg eszopiclone dose were assessed in 16 healthy volunteers and in 8 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver disease. Exposure was increased 2-fold in severely impaired patients compared with the healthy volunteers. Cmax and tmax were unchanged. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【185】 - Renal Impairment\n【186】 - The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone were studied in 24 patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. AUC and Cmax were similar in the patients compared with demographically matched healthy control subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, since less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.\n【187】 - Drug Interactions\n【188】 - Eszopiclone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 via demethylation and oxidation. There were no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between eszopiclone and paroxetine. When eszopiclone was coadministered with olanzapine, no pharmacokinetic interaction was detected in levels of eszopiclone or olanzapine, but a pharmacodynamic interaction was seen on a measure of psychomotor function. Eszopiclone and lorazepam decreased each other’s Cmax by 22%. Coadministration of eszopiclone 3 mg to subjects receiving ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in exposure to eszopiclone. Cmax and t1/2 were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. Eszopiclone would not be expected to alter the clearance of drugs metabolized by common CYP450 enzymes.\n【189】 - Paroxetine\n【190】 - Coadministration of single dose of eszopiclone and paroxetine produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.\n【191】 - Lorazepam\n【192】 - Coadministration of single doses of eszopiclone and lorazepam did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.\n【193】 - Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index\n【194】 - Digoxin\n【195】 - A single dose of eszopiclone 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days.\n【196】 - Warfarin\n【197】 - Eszopiclone 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of (R)- or (S)-warfarin, nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of warfarin.\n【198】 - Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein\n【199】 - Eszopiclone is not highly bound to plasma proteins (52 to 59% bound); therefore, the disposition of eszopiclone is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding. Administration of eszopiclone 3 mg to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound would not be expected to cause an alteration in the free concentration of either drug.\n【200】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【201】 - Carcinogenesis\n【202】 - In a carcinogenicity study in rats, oral administration of eszopiclone for 97 (males) or 104 (females) weeks resulted in no increases in tumors; plasma levels (AUC) of eszopiclone at the highest dose tested (16 mg/kg/day) are approximately 80 (females) and 20 (males) times those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day. However, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, oral administration of racemic zopiclone  times those in humans at the MRHD of eszopiclone. The mechanism for the increase in mammary adenocarcinomas is unknown. The increase in thyroid tumors is thought to be due to increased levels of TSH secondary to increased metabolism of circulating thyroid hormones, a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.\n【203】 - In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, oral administration of racemic zopiclone .\n【204】 - Eszopiclone did not increase tumors in a p53 transgenic mouse bioassay at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day.\n【205】 - Mutagenesis\n【206】 - Eszopiclone was clastogenic in in vitro (mouse lymphoma and chromosomal aberration) assays in mammalian cells. Eszopiclone was negative in the in vitro bacterial gene mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vivo micronucleus assay.\n【207】 - (S)-N-desmethyl zopiclone, a metabolite of eszopiclone, was positive in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in mammalian cells. (S)-N-desmethyl zopiclone was negative in the in vitro bacterial gene mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assay.\n【208】 - Impairment of Fertility\n【209】 - Oral administration of eszopiclone to rats prior to and during mating, and continuing in females to day 7 of gestation (doses up to 45 mg/kg/day to males and females or up to 180 mg/kg/day to females only) resulted in decreased fertility, with no pregnancy at the highest dose tested when both males and females were treated. In females, there was an increase in abnormal estrus cycles at the highest dose tested. In males, decreases in sperm number and motility and increases in morphologically abnormal sperm were observed at the mid and high doses. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on fertility (5 mg/kg/day) is 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.\n【210】 # Clinical Studies\n【211】 - The effect of eszopiclone on reducing sleep latency and improving sleep maintenance was established in studies with 2100 subjects (ages 18 to  with chronic and transient insomnia in six placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months’ duration. Two of these trials were in elderly patients (n=. Overall, at the recommended adult dose (2 to 3 mg) and elderly dose (1 to 2 mg), eszopiclone significantly decreased sleep latency and improved measures of sleep maintenance (objectively measured as wake time after sleep onset  and subjectively measured as total sleep time).\n【212】 - Transient Insomnia\n【213】 - Healthy adults were evaluated in a model of transient insomnia (n= in a sleep laboratory in a double-blind, parallel-group, single-night trial comparing two doses of eszopiclone and placebo. Eszopiclone 3 mg was superior to placebo on measures of sleep latency and sleep maintenance, including polysomnographic (PSG) parameters of latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and WASO.\n【214】 - Chronic Insomnia (Adults and Elderly)\n【215】 - The effectiveness of eszopiclone was established in five controlled studies in chronic insomnia. Three controlled studies were in adult subjects, and two controlled studies were in elderly subjects with chronic insomnia.\n【216】 - Adults\n【217】 In the first study, adults with chronic insomnia (n= were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel-group trial of 6 weeks’ duration comparing eszopiclone 2 mg and 3 mg with placebo. Objective endpoints were measured for 4 weeks. Both 2 mg and 3 mg were superior to placebo on LPS at 4 weeks. The 3 mg dose was superior to placebo on WASO.\n【218】 In the second study, adults with chronic insomnia (n= were evaluated using subjective measures in a double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing the safety and efficacy of eszopiclone 3 mg with placebo administered nightly for 6 months. Eszopiclone was superior to placebo on subjective measures of sleep latency, total sleep time, and WASO.\n【219】 In addition, a 6-period cross-over PSG study evaluating eszopiclone doses of 1 to 3 mg, each given over a 2-day period, demonstrated effectiveness of all doses on LPS, and of 3 mg on WASO. In this trial, the response was dose-related.\n【220】 - In the first study, adults with chronic insomnia (n= were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel-group trial of 6 weeks’ duration comparing eszopiclone 2 mg and 3 mg with placebo. Objective endpoints were measured for 4 weeks. Both 2 mg and 3 mg were superior to placebo on LPS at 4 weeks. The 3 mg dose was superior to placebo on WASO.\n【221】 - In the second study, adults with chronic insomnia (n= were evaluated using subjective measures in a double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing the safety and efficacy of eszopiclone 3 mg with placebo administered nightly for 6 months. Eszopiclone was superior to placebo on subjective measures of sleep latency, total sleep time, and WASO.\n【222】 - In addition, a 6-period cross-over PSG study evaluating eszopiclone doses of 1 to 3 mg, each given over a 2-day period, demonstrated effectiveness of all doses on LPS, and of 3 mg on WASO. In this trial, the response was dose-related.\n【223】 - Elderly\n【224】 Elderly subjects (ages 65 to  with chronic insomnia were evaluated in two double-blind, parallel-group trials of 2 weeks duration. One study (n= compared the effects of eszopiclone with placebo on subjective outcome measures, and the other (n= on objective and subjective outcome measures. The first study compared 1 mg and 2 mg of eszopiclone with placebo, while the second study compared 2 mg of eszopiclone with placebo. All doses were superior to placebo on measures of sleep latency. In both studies, 2 mg of eszopiclone was superior to placebo on measures of sleep maintenance.\n【225】 - Elderly subjects (ages 65 to  with chronic insomnia were evaluated in two double-blind, parallel-group trials of 2 weeks duration. One study (n= compared the effects of eszopiclone with placebo on subjective outcome measures, and the other (n= on objective and subjective outcome measures. The first study compared 1 mg and 2 mg of eszopiclone with placebo, while the second study compared 2 mg of eszopiclone with placebo. All doses were superior to placebo on measures of sleep latency. In both studies, 2 mg of eszopiclone was superior to placebo on measures of sleep maintenance.\n【226】 - Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sedative Hypnotic Drugs\n【227】 - Next Day Residual Effects\n【228】 In a double-blind study of 91 healthy adults age 25- to 40 years, the effects of eszopiclone 3 mg on psychomotor function were assessed between 7.5 and 11.5 hours the morning after dosing. Measures included tests of psychomotor coordination that are correlated with ability to maintain a motor vehicle in the driving lane, tests of working memory, and subjective perception of sedation and coordination. Compared with placebo, eszopiclone 3 mg was associated with next- morning psychomotor and memory impairment that was most severe at 7.5 hours, but still present and potentially clinically meaningful at 11.5 hours. Subjective perception of sedation and coordination from eszopiclone 3 mg was not consistently different from placebo, even though subjects were objectively impaired.\n【229】 In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nightly administered eszopiclone 3 mg, memory impairment was reported by 1.3% (8/ of subjects treated with eszopiclone 3 mg compared to 0% (0/ of subjects treated with placebo. In a 6-week adult study of nightly administered eszopiclone confusion was reported by 3% of patients treated with eszopiclone 3 mg, compared to 0% of subjects treated with placebo. In the same study, memory impairment was reported by 1% of patents treated with either 2 mg or 3 mg eszopiclone, compared to 0% treated with placebo.\n【230】 In a 2-week study of 264 elderly insomniacs, 1.5% of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg reported memory impairment compared to 0% treated with placebo. In another 2-week study of 231 elderly insomniacs, 2.5% of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg reported confusion compared to 0% treated with placebo.\n【231】 A study of normal subjects exposed to single fixed doses of eszopiclone from 1 to 7.5 mg using the DSST to assess sedation and psychomotor function at fixed times after dosing (hourly up to 16 hours) found the expected sedation and reduction in psychomotor function. This was maximal at 1 hour and present up to 4 hours, but was no longer present by 5 hours.\n【232】 In another study, patients with insomnia were given 2 or 3 mg doses of eszopiclone nightly, with DSST assessed on the mornings following days 1, 15, and 29 of treatment. While both the placebo and eszopiclone 3 mg groups showed an improvement in DSST scores relative to baseline the following morning (presumably due to a learning effect), the improvement in the placebo group was greater and reached statistical significance on night 1, although not on nights 15 and 29. For the eszopiclone 2 mg group, DSST change scores were not significantly different from placebo at any time point.\n【233】 - In a double-blind study of 91 healthy adults age 25- to 40 years, the effects of eszopiclone 3 mg on psychomotor function were assessed between 7.5 and 11.5 hours the morning after dosing. Measures included tests of psychomotor coordination that are correlated with ability to maintain a motor vehicle in the driving lane, tests of working memory, and subjective perception of sedation and coordination. Compared with placebo, eszopiclone 3 mg was associated with next- morning psychomotor and memory impairment that was most severe at 7.5 hours, but still present and potentially clinically meaningful at 11.5 hours. Subjective perception of sedation and coordination from eszopiclone 3 mg was not consistently different from placebo, even though subjects were objectively impaired.\n【234】 - In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nightly administered eszopiclone 3 mg, memory impairment was reported by 1.3% (8/ of subjects treated with eszopiclone 3 mg compared to 0% (0/ of subjects treated with placebo. In a 6-week adult study of nightly administered eszopiclone confusion was reported by 3% of patients treated with eszopiclone 3 mg, compared to 0% of subjects treated with placebo. In the same study, memory impairment was reported by 1% of patents treated with either 2 mg or 3 mg eszopiclone, compared to 0% treated with placebo.\n【235】 - In a 2-week study of 264 elderly insomniacs, 1.5% of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg reported memory impairment compared to 0% treated with placebo. In another 2-week study of 231 elderly insomniacs, 2.5% of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg reported confusion compared to 0% treated with placebo.\n【236】 - A study of normal subjects exposed to single fixed doses of eszopiclone from 1 to 7.5 mg using the DSST to assess sedation and psychomotor function at fixed times after dosing (hourly up to 16 hours) found the expected sedation and reduction in psychomotor function. This was maximal at 1 hour and present up to 4 hours, but was no longer present by 5 hours.\n【237】 - In another study, patients with insomnia were given 2 or 3 mg doses of eszopiclone nightly, with DSST assessed on the mornings following days 1, 15, and 29 of treatment. While both the placebo and eszopiclone 3 mg groups showed an improvement in DSST scores relative to baseline the following morning (presumably due to a learning effect), the improvement in the placebo group was greater and reached statistical significance on night 1, although not on nights 15 and 29. For the eszopiclone 2 mg group, DSST change scores were not significantly different from placebo at any time point.\n【238】 - Withdrawal-Emergent Anxiety and Insomnia\n【239】 During nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation has been observed with other hypnotics. If a drug has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each night’s use. This is believed to be responsible for two clinical findings reported to occur after several weeks of nightly use of other rapidly eliminated hypnoti\n【240】 In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study of nightly administration of eszopiclone 3 mg, rates of anxiety reported as an adverse event were 2.1% in the placebo arm and 3.7% in the eszopiclone arm. In a 6-week adult study of nightly administration, anxiety was reported as an adverse event in 0%, 2.9%, and 1% of the placebo, 2 mg, and 3 mg treatment arms, respectively. In this study, single-blind placebo was administered on nights 45 and 46, the first and second days of withdrawal from study drug. New adverse events were recorded during the withdrawal period, beginning with day 45, up to 14 days after discontinuation. During this withdrawal period, 105 subjects previously taking nightly eszopiclone 3 mg for 44 nights spontaneously reported anxiety (1%), abnormal dreams (1.9%), hyperesthesia (1%), and neurosis (1%), while none of 99 subjects previously taking placebo reported any of these adverse events during the withdrawal period.\n【241】 Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent temporary worsening in sleep parameters (latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) compared with baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics. Rebound insomnia following discontinuation of eszopiclone relative to placebo and baseline was examined objectively in a 6-week adult study on the first 2 nights of discontinuation (nights 45 and  following 44 nights of active treatment with 2 mg or 3 mg. In the eszopiclone 2 mg group, compared with baseline, there was a significant increase in WASO and a decrease in sleep efficiency, both occurring only on the first night after discontinuation of treatment. No changes from baseline were noted in the eszopiclone 3 mg group on the first night after discontinuation, and there was a significant improvement in LPS and sleep efficiency compared with baseline following the second night of discontinuation. Comparisons of changes from baseline between eszopiclone and placebo were  performed. On the first night after discontinuation of eszopiclone 2 mg, LPS and WASO were significantly increased and sleep efficiency was reduced; there were no significant differences on the second night. On the first night following discontinuation of eszopiclone 3 mg, sleep efficiency was significantly reduced. No other differences from placebo were noted in any other sleep parameter on either the first or second night following discontinuation. For both doses, the discontinuation-emergent effect was mild, had the characteristics of the return of the symptoms of chronic insomnia, and appeared to resolve by the second night after eszopiclone discontinuation.\n【242】 - During nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation has been observed with other hypnotics. If a drug has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each night’s use.

In a 6-week adult study of nightly administration, anxiety was reported as an adverse event in 0%, 2.9%, and 1% of the placebo, 2 mg, and 3 mg treatment arms, respectively. In this study, single-blind placebo was administered on nights 45 and 46, the first and second days of withdrawal from study drug. New adverse events were recorded during the withdrawal period, beginning with day 45, up to 14 days after discontinuation. During this withdrawal period, 105 subjects previously taking nightly eszopiclone 3 mg for 44 nights spontaneously reported anxiety (1%), abnormal dreams (1.9%), hyperesthesia (1%), and neurosis (1%), while none of 99 subjects previously taking placebo reported any of these adverse events during the withdrawal period.\n【244】 - Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent temporary worsening in sleep parameters (latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) compared with baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics. Rebound insomnia following discontinuation of eszopiclone relative to placebo and baseline was examined objectively in a 6-week adult study on the first 2 nights of discontinuation (nights 45 and  following 44 nights of active treatment with 2 mg or 3 mg. In the eszopiclone 2 mg group, compared with baseline, there was a significant increase in WASO and a decrease in sleep efficiency, both occurring only on the first night after discontinuation of treatment.

On the first night after discontinuation of eszopiclone 2 mg, LPS and WASO were significantly increased and sleep efficiency was reduced; there were no significant differences on the second night. On the first night following discontinuation of eszopiclone 3 mg, sleep efficiency was significantly reduced. No other differences from placebo were noted in any other sleep parameter on either the first or second night following discontinuation. For both doses, the discontinuation-emergent effect was mild, had the characteristics of the return of the symptoms of chronic insomnia, and appeared to resolve by the second night after eszopiclone discontinuation.\n【245】 # How Supplied\n【246】 - Eszopiclone tablets are round, white, film-coated tablets and are supplied as follows:\n【247】 - The 1 mg tablets are debossed with product identification “54 746” on one side and plain on the other side.\n【248】 - NDC 0054-0290-13 1 mg, bottle of 30\n【249】 - NDC 0054-0290-25 1 mg, bottle of 100\n【250】 - The 2 mg tablets are debossed with product identification “54 029” on one side and plain on the other side.\n【251】 - NDC 0054-0291-25 2 mg, bottle of 100\n【252】 - The 3 mg tablets are debossed with product identification “54 396” on one side and plain on the other side.\n【253】 - NDC 0054-0292-25 3 mg, bottle of 100\n【254】 - Storage\n【255】 - Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).\n【256】 ## Storage\n【257】 There is limited information regarding Eszopiclone Storage in the drug label.\n【258】 # Images\n【259】 ## Drug Images\n【260】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【261】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【262】 - Inform patients and their families about the benefits and risks of treatment with eszopiclone.

Patients with bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN  had a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.\n【44】 - Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose; increase the frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias.  Delay administration of Eribulin and reduce subsequent doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days.  Clinical studies of Eribulin did not include patients with baseline neutrophil counts below 1,500/mm3.\n【45】 ### Peripheral Neuropathy\n【46】 - Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% (40/ of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% (2/ of patients in Study 1.\n【47】 - Peripheral neuropathy was the most common toxicity leading to discontinuation of Eribulin (5% of patients; 24/.\n【48】 - Neuropathy lasting more than one year occurred in 5% (26/ of patients.\n【49】 - Twenty-two percent (109/ of patients developed a new or worsening neuropathy that had not recovered within a median follow-up duration of 269 days (range 25-662 days).\n【50】 - Monitor patients closely for signs of peripheral motor neuropathy and sensory neuropathy.\n【51】 - Withhold Eribulin in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to Grade 2 or less.\n【52】 ### Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n【53】 - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Eribulin in pregnant women.\n【54】 - Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor; therefore, it is expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\n【55】 - Embryo-fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats that received eribulin mesylate at approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body surface area.\n【56】 - If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n【57】 ### Prolongation\n【58】 - In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, independent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia antiarrhythmics and Class III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating Eribulin and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid Eribulin in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n【59】 # Adverse Reactions\n【60】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【61】 The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling:\n【62】 - Neutropenia.\n【63】 - Peripheral neuropathy.\n【64】 - QT interval prolongation.\n【65】 - The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) reported in patients receiving Eribulin were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. The most common serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving Eribulin were febrile neutropenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of Eribulin was peripheral neuropathy (5%).\n【66】 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n【67】 - In clinical trials, Eribulin has been administered to 1,222 patients with multiple tumor types, including 240 patients exposed to Eribulin for 6 months or longer. The majority of the 1,222 patients were women (82%) with a median age of 58 years (range: 26 to 91 years).  The racial and ethnic distribution was Caucasian (83%), Black (5%), Asian (2%), and other (5%).\n【68】 - The adverse reactions described in  were identified in 750 patients treated in Study 1. In Study 1, patients were randomized (2: to receive either Eribulin (1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or single agent treatment chosen by their physician (control group).  A total of 503 patients received Eribulin  and 247 patients in the control group received therapy consisting of chemotherapy  or hormonal therapy (3%). The median duration of exposure was 118 days for patients receiving Eribulin and 63 days for patients receiving control therapy.   reports the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either group.\n【69】 ### Cytopenias\n【70】 - Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 28% (143/ of patients who received Eribulin in Study 1, and 29% (144/ of patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% (23/ of patients; two patients (0.4%) died from complications of febrile neutropenia. Dose reduction due to neutropenia was required in 12% (62/ of patients and discontinuation was required in <1% of patients. The mean time to nadir was 13 days and the mean time to recovery from severe neutropenia (<500/mm was 8 days. Grade 3 or greater thrombocytopenia occurred in 1% (7/ of patients. G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) or GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor) was used in 19% of patients who received Eribulin.\n【71】 ### Peripheral Neuropathy\n【72】 - In Study 1, 17 % of enrolled patients had Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and 3% of patients had Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Dose reduction due to peripheral neuropathy was required by 3% (14/ of patients who received Eribulin.\n【73】 - Four percent (20/ of patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy of any grade and 2% (8/ of patients developed Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy.\n【74】 ### Liver Function Test Abnormalities\n【75】 - Among patients with Grade 0 or 1 ALT levels at baseline, 18% of Eribulin-treated patients experienced Grade 2 or greater ALT elevation. *One Eribulin-treated patient without documented liver metastases had concomitant Grade 2 elevations in bilirubin and ALT; these abnormalities resolved and did not recur with re-exposure to Eribulin.\n【76】 ### Less Common Adverse Reactions\n【77】 The following additional adverse reactions were reported in ≥5% to <10% of the Eribulin-treated group:\n【78】 - Eye Disorders: increased lacrimation\n【79】 - Gastrointestinal Disorders: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, dry mouth\n【80】 - General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: peripheral edema\n【81】 - Infections and Infestations: upper respiratory tract infection\n【82】 - Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypokalemia\n【83】 - Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle spasms, muscular weakness\n【84】 - Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia, dizziness\n【85】 - Psychiatric Disorders: insomnia, depression\n【86】 - Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash\n【87】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【88】 The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-approval of Eribulin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n【89】 - Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: lymphopenia\n【90】 - Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis\n【91】 - Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatotoxicity\n【92】 - Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity\n【93】 - Infections and Infestations: pneumonia, sepsis/neutropenic sepsis\n【94】 - Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypomagnesemia, dehydration\n【95】 - Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: interstitial lung disease\n【96】 - Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: pruritus\n【97】 # Drug Interactions\n【98】 ### Effects of Other Drugs on Eribulin\n【99】 - No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. Clinically meaningful differences in exposure (AUC) were not observed in patients with advanced solid tumors when Eribulin was administered with or without ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a P-gp inhibitor) and when Eribulin was administered with or without rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer).\n【100】 ### Effects of Eribulin on Other Drugs\n【101】 - Eribulin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 enzymes or induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations.  Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes.\n【102】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【103】 ### Pregnancy\n【104】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): D\n【105】 - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Eribulin in pregnant women.  Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor, therefore, it is expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryo-fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats that received eribulin mesylate at approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body surface area. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n【106】 - In a developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats received intravenous infusion of eribulin mesylate during organogenesis (Gestation Days 8, 10, and  at doses approximately 0.04, 0.13, 0.43 and 0.64 times the recommended human dose, based on body surface area (mg/m.  Increased abortion and severe external or soft tissue malformations were observed in offspring at doses 0.64 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m, including the absence of a lower jaw, tongue, stomach and spleen. Increased embryo-fetal death/resorption, reduced fetal weights, and minor skeletal anomalies consistent with developmental delay were  reported at or above doses of 0.43 times the recommended human dose.\n【107】 - Maternal toxicity of eribulin mesylate was reported in rats at or above doses of 0.43 times the recommended human dose (mg/m²), and included enlarged spleen, reduced maternal weight gain and decreased food consumption.\n【108】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【109】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Eribulin in women who are pregnant.\n【110】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【111】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Eribulin during labor and delivery.\n【112】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【113】 - It is not known whether Eribulin is excreted into human milk.  No studies in humans or animals were conducted to determine if Eribulin is excreted into milk.  Because many drugs are excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in human milk fed infants from Eribulin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Eribulin taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【114】 ### Pediatric Use\n【115】 - The safety and effectiveness of Eribulin in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.\n【116】 ### Geriatic Use\n【117】 - Study 1 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Of the 827 subjects who received the recommended dose and schedule of Eribulin in clinical studies, 15% (121/ were 65 and older, and 2% (17/ patients were 75 and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.\n【118】 ### Gender\n【119】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eribulin with respect to specific gender populations.\n【120】 ### Race\n【121】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eribulin with respect to specific racial populations.\n【122】 ### Renal Impairment\n【123】 - For patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), the geometric mean dose-normalized systemic exposure increased 2-fold compared to patients with normal renal function. A lower starting dose of 1.1 mg/m2 is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment. The safety of Eribulin was not studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min)\n【124】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【125】 - Administration of Eribulin at a dose of 1.1 mg/m2 to patients with mild hepatic impairment and 0.7 mg/m2 to patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in similar exposure to eribulin as a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 to patients with normal hepatic function. Therefore, a lower starting dose of 1.1 mg/m2 is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and of 0.7 mg/m2 is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Eribulin was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)\n【126】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【127】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Eribulin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【128】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【129】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Eribulin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【130】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【131】 ### Administration\n【132】 There is limited information regarding Eribulin Administration in the drug label.\n【133】 ### Monitoring\n【134】 There is limited information regarding Eribulin Monitoring in the drug label.\n【135】 # IV Compatibility\n【136】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Eribulin and IV administrations.\n【137】 # Overdosage\n【138】 - Overdosage of Eribulin has been reported at approximately 4 times the recommended dose, which resulted in Grade 3 neutropenia lasting seven days and a Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction lasting one day. There is no known antidote for Eribulin overdose.\n【139】 # Pharmacology\n【140】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【141】 - Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage.\n【142】 ## Structure\n【143】 - It has a molecular weight of 826.0 (729.9 for free base).  The empirical formula is C40H59NO11CH4O3S. Eribulin mesylate has the following structural formula:\n【144】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【145】 There is limited information regarding Eribulin Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n【146】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【147】 - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin is linear with a mean elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours, a mean volume of distribution of 43 L/m2  to 114 L/m2 and mean clearance of 1.16 L/hr/m2 to 2.42 L/hr/m2 over the dose range of  0.25 mg/m2 to 4.0 mg/m2. The human plasma protein binding of eribulin  at concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 1,000 ng/mL ranges from 49% to 65%  Eribulin exposure after multiple dosing is comparable to that following a single dose.  No accumulation of eribulin is observed with weekly administration.\n【148】 - Unchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in plasma following administration of 14C‑eribulin to patients.  Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% of parent compound, confirming that there are no major human metabolites of eribulin.  Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A negligibly metabolizes eribulin in vitro.\n【149】 - Eribulin is eliminated primarily in feces unchanged.  After administration of 14C-eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in feces and 9% in urine. Unchanged eribulin accounted for approximately 88% and 91% of the dose in feces and urine, respectively.\n【150】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【151】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【152】 Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with eribulin mesylate.\n【153】 Eribulin mesylate was not mutagenic in in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays (Ames test). Eribulin mesylate was positive in mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assays, and was clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.\n【154】 The effects of Eribulin on human fertility are unknown. Fertility studies have not been conducted with eribulin mesylate in humans or animals.   However, nonclinical findings in repeated-dose dog and rat toxicology studies suggest that male fertility may be compromised by treatment with eribulin mesylate. Rats exhibited testicular toxicity (hypocellularity of seminiferous epithelium with hypospermia/aspermia) following dosing with eribulin mesylate at or above 0.43 times the recommended human dose (mg/m given once weekly for 3 weeks, or at or above 0.21 times the recommended human dose (mg/m given once weekly for 3 out of 5 weeks, repeated for 6 cycles. Testicular toxicity was  observed in dogs given 0.64 times the recommended human dose (mg/m weekly for 3 out of 5 weeks, repeated for 6 cycles.\n【155】 # Clinical Studies\n【156】 - Study 1 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial of 762 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease and experienced disease progression within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen.  Patients were required to receive prior anthracycline- and taxane- based chemotherapy for adjuvant or metastatic disease. Patients were randomized (2: to receive Eribulin (n= or a single agent therapy selected prior to randomization (control arm, n=.  Randomization was stratified by geographic region, HER2/neu status, and prior capecitabine exposure. Eribulin was administered at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Eribulin-treated patients received a median of 5 cycles (range: 1 to 23 cycles) of therapy.  Control arm therapy consisted of 97% chemotherapy (26% vinorelbine, 18% gemcitabine, 18% capecitabine, 16% taxane, 9% anthracycline, 10% other chemotherapy), and 3% hormonal therapy. The main efficacy outcome was overall survival.\n【157】 - Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment arms.  The median age was 55 (range: 27 to 85 years) and 92% were White. Sixty-four percent of patients were enrolled in North America/Western Europe/Australia, 25% in Eastern Europe/Russia, and 11% in Latin America/South Africa.  Ninety-one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Tumor prognostic characteristics, including estrogen receptor status (positive: 67%, negative: 28%), progesterone receptor status (positive: 49%, negative: 39%), HER2/neu receptor status (positive: 16%, negative: 74%), triple negative status (ER-,PR-,HER2/neu-: 19%), presence of visceral disease (82%, including 60% liver and 38% lung) and bone disease (61%), and number of sites of metastases (greater than two: 50%), were  similar in the Eribulin and control arms. Patients received a median of four prior chemotherapy regimens in both arms.\n【158】 - In Study 1, a statistically significant improvement in overall survival was observed in patients randomized to the Eribulin arm compared to the control arm  ).  An updated, unplanned survival analysis, conducted when 77% of events had been observed  ), was consistent with the primary analysis.  In patients randomized to Eribulin, the objective response rate by the RECIST criteria was 11% (95% CI:  8.6%, 14.3%) and the median response duration was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.8, 5.0 months).\n【159】 # How Supplied\n【160】 - Eribulin mesylate injection, 1 mg/2 mL, in a single-use vial.

It is a rare but has been thought to be uniformly fatal if not treated surgically. In the earlier experiences with this entity, a chronic infectious process arising in the lung (pneumonitis or abcess or aorta), mycotic aneurysm  was the most frequent cause. In recent decades, the reported aortopulmonary fistulas have occurred most frequently as the result of erosion and/or rupture of a degenerative or false aneurysm of the distal aortic arch or descending thoracic aorta into the left lung. It can occur either in the acute or chronic phase of aortic dissection, either with or without previous cardiovascular surgery. Hemoptysis is the most common presentation of aortopulmonary fistula after cardiac surgery. The reported interval between the time of operation and the onset of hemoptysis ranges from 3 weeks to 25 years.  Aortopulmonary fistula subsequently leads to several complications such as rapid left-to-right shunt and right heart failure. Diagnostic examinations are often unable to directly visualize a fistula. Aortography is the gold standard. Indication for surgical or endovascular repair mostly relies on clinical suspicion and nonspecific diagnostic features. Aortobronchopulmonary fistulas are uniformly fatal if untreated. The overall surgical mortality rate is 15.3%.\n【3】 # Pathophysiology and Etiology\n【4】 Aortopulmonary fistula usually occurs when there is damage to the wall of aorta or pulmonary artery which causes a communication between these two adjacent anatomic structures. Most of the time it happens in an event of aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, any surgery that causes damage to wall of aorta or pulmonary artery, pulmonary hypertension and extremely high flow through aorta or pulmonary artery. This can  occur if walls of aorta are fragile as they can be in an event of atherosclerosis, aortitis or any other cause of inflammation of aorta and Marfan's syndrome. The fistula leads to rapid left to right shunting and can have severe consequences. This causes the oxygen saturation of the blood to fall and it can present with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.\n【5】 # Risk Factors\n【6】 Some of the risk factors for aortopulmonary fistula are given below:\n【7】 - Complication of surgery or thoracic aortic graft\n【8】 - Indwelling chest tube, spinal fixation device, or foreign body\n【9】 - Congenital\n【10】 - Repair of coarctation of aorta\n【11】 - Use of Dacron draft for aortic repair surgery\n【12】 Elective thoracic endovascular aortic repair is comparatively a safer option\n【13】 - Elective thoracic endovascular aortic repair is comparatively a safer option\n【14】 - Bentall operation\n【15】 - Marfan's syndrome\n【16】 - Atherosclerotic inflammation\n【17】 - Hypertension\n【18】 - Blunt chest trauma\n【19】 - Transcatheter pulmonary valve placement\n【20】 - Ross procedure\n【21】 - Pulmonary angioplasty\n【22】 - Truncus arteriosus repair\n【23】 - Atrial switch operation\n【24】 - High output heart failure\n【25】 - Neoplasm\n【26】 - Bicuspid aortic valve\n【27】 - Erosion and/or rupture of a degenerative or false aneurysm of the distal aortic arch or descending thoracic aorta into the lung. Possible reasons of true or false aneurysms:\n【28】 - True aneurysm\n【29】 - Infectious aortitis\n【30】 - Aortic dissection\n【31】 - Traumatic aortic tear\n【32】 - Aortic suture line breakdown\n【33】 # Signs And Symptoms\n【34】 The most frequent symptoms of an aortopulmonary fistula are chest pain and hemoptysis, but often shortness of breath, fever, and/or other respiratory symptoms are present. It can  presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, chest discomfort on exertion, dizziness, cool extremities, edema, hypothermic circulatory arrest, right ventricular dysfunction and other symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n【35】 # Examination\n【36】 Usually the first clue to an aortopulmonary fistula is unstable vitals. A person can have tachycardia, bounding pulse and increased respiratory rate. Sudden lipothymia and anemia can  indicate aortopulmonary fistula. A person can have prominent precordium, palpable thrill and murmur. There could be crackles and ronchi heard on auscultating lungs.\n【37】 # Post Operation Care\n【38】 In repair of aortopulmonary fistula, patient should be rigorously followed and an eye should be kept on his cardiac health. Few patients who went through aortopulmonary fistula repair showed signs of class one heart failure with in one year of post operation course. During any aortic surgical repair, use of prosthesis should be avoided because it can lead to greater chances of recurrent infection. Use of pulmonary allograft should  be made available and should be implanted when necessary.\n【39】 # Complications\n【40】 Aortopulmonary fistula can be very lethal. Mediastinitis and other infection can be one of the complication if recurrent infection occur after surgical repair. Sudden death can occur if immediate surgical intervention is not made at an appropriate time. The risk factors associated with early death after surgical repair are:\n【41】 - Old age\n【42】 - Congestive cardiac insufficiency\n【43】 - Angina\n【44】 - Dissection\n【45】 - Aortic arch management and co-morbidities\n【46】 Factors like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic arterial hypertension and peripheral vascular insufficiency in addition to coronary artery insufficiency can  dictate the course of disease.\n【47】 # Diagnosis\n【48】 It is very crucial to diagnose aortopulmonary fistula at the appropriate time. Timely diagnosis and intervention can save life. There are countless diagnostic modalities which can help in diagnosing aortopulmonary fistula. Aortography is the gold standard to diagnose it. It is very important to know the exact location and dimension of fistula before any surgical intervention can be done.\n【49】 ## Chest x-ray\n【50】 Chest x-rays help to confirm pulmonary infiltrates. It can show widened mediastinum with pulmonary plethora. It can  show signs of pulmonary edema bt all these findings are non specific and can happen in many other cardiac and pulmonary pathologies.\n【51】 ## Echocardiogram\n【52】 Echocardiogram can show dilation of aorta and increased flow of pulmonary artery. It can  show other features like enlarged chambers of heart. It might or might not not show the location of fistula.\n【53】 ## Cardiac Catheterization\n【54】 Cardiac catheterization can show elevated pressure in pulmonary artery. The pressures can be as high as that of aorta which supports the idea of a communication between aorta and pulmonary artery. It can  reveal a step up in oxygen saturation on right sided chamber and vessels of heart but it does not show the location of fistula.\n【55】 ## EKG\n【56】 Electrocardiogram can show tachycardia on the EKG strip. Usually there are no ST segment changes but ST segment changes can show up  in case of ischemia of heart  o\n【57】 ## CT\n【58】 ## Bronchoscopy\n【59】 Bronchoscopy during an episode of hemoptysis can document its lobar origin.\n【60】 ## Aortography\n【61】 Aortography is a gold standard of diagnosing of aortopulmonary fistula. Subtraction technique may help to obtain additional information.\n【62】 Following things should be considered before doing this est\n【63】 - Renal function tests\n【64】 - Allergy to dyes\n【65】 - Breast feeding and pregnancy\n【66】 - Metal implants\n【67】 Aortography can tell us about the exact location and dimension of aortopulmonary fistula.\n【68】 # Treatment\n【69】 Once the diagnosis is confirmed, prompt surgical or percutaneous interventions are indicated.\n【70】 The indications for urgent treatment are given below\n【71】 - Hemoptysis\n【72】 - History of previous cardiac or aortic operation\n【73】 - presence of lung infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram\n【74】 - lung hemorrage on the computed tomographic scan,\n【75】 - visualization of a pseudoaneurysm.\n【76】 The main focus of treatment should be to control the right to left shunting, resolve the edema in lungs and minimize the signs of heart failure.

Flow of fluid into the peritoneal cavity prevents the accumulation of fluid around the heart (a pericardial effusion), which might cause compression and impaired filling of the heart (cardiac tamponade), a dangerous complication. The procedure is performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The creation of a pericardial window is usually performed by a cardiac surgeon or thoracic surgeon who makes an incision, commonly sub-xiphoid, and cuts a small hole in the pericardium. This surgery is performed with local anesthesia. An incision is made either below the sternum, or alternately between the ribs of the left chest. The resection can be with scissors, cautery, a stapling device, or a harmonic scalpel, with no one technique demonstrably better than another. It is best to have a combination of techniques available to resect the pericardium adequately. The surgeon may place a catheter in the pericardial window so that fluid can continue to drain for a short period of time after the surgery. Chest tubes are removed in 2-3 days once the drainage is less than 200cc/24hrs.\n【3】 # Indication\n【4】 The indication for creation of a pericardial window is a pericardial effusion (fluid build-up) that is either symptomatic, or if the patient is on the verge of cardiac tamponade or if cardiac tamponade has developed. A surgical approach is recommended only in patients with very large chronic effusion, for whom repeated pericardiocentesis have been unsuccessful.\n【5】 # Procedure\n【6】 Performing a pericardial window traditionally required open-chest surgery, resulting in a large scar and a lengthy recovery time. With the advent of minimally-invasive robotic surgery and the thoracoscopic approach to pericardial window, however, a new approach became available resulting in less trauma, less pain and faster recovery, even that until recently, patients in tamponade were considered unsuitable for a thoracoscopic window.\n【7】 There are 2 approaches for pericardial window procedure:\n【8】 1. Subxiphoid approach\n【9】 A short vertical incision (about 5-7 cm long) is made over the xiphoid process extending onto the midline of the abdomen. The linea alba is incised, and the xiphoid is often completely removed. By finger dissection, the surgeon can reach the retrosternal space. The diaphragmatic aspect of the pericardium is visualized by upward retraction. The pericardium can be grasped with the hook or can be incised directly. A sucker is inserted into the pericardial space and the fluid aspirated. Often a sucker or a finger is used for further dissection of any adhesions.\n【10】 After all the fluid has been aspirated, the epicardium is inspected and a biopsy specimen can  be taken from the pericardium. A finger is introduced into the pericardial space to determine if any additional adhesions exist or if any nodules are there in the pericardium. Finally, a tube is inserted into the pericardial space and connected through a separate stab wound; the incision is closed in layers.\n【11】 2. Thoracotomy approach\n【12】 A small anterior thoracotomy is made in the fourth or fifth intercostal space. To expose the chosen intercostal space, an inframammary skin incision (5-7 cm long) is made, which allows division of the pectoralis muscle. The intercostal space is opened over the superior margin of the rib entering the pleural cavity. A retractor is placed and the pericardium is visualized. The pericardium is incised anterior to the phrenic nerve with a scalpel or scissors. A window is created and the pericardial specimen is sent for histopathology, and samples of pleural effusion are obtained. A chest tube is placed within the pericardium and placed on water seal or suction and the incision is closed in layers.\n【13】 # Recovery\n【14】 Depending on the underlying disease process, patients can be usually discharged in two days.\n", "seq_id": 18276, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-18 00:10:32"}

Soldiers are given a score based of performance consisting of three events, the sit-up (SU), push-up (PU) and a two mile run, normally ranging from 0-300. A passing score is 180 or higher with a minimum score of 60 in each event. Army Field Manual FM 21-20 covers the administration of the APFT, as well as ways to conduct personal, squad and unit level physical training (PT) sessions.\n【2】 A soldier is required to take a \"record\" (meaning for official records) APFT once every 6 months.  If, due to a diagnosed medical condition, a soldier is temporarily unable to conduct one or more of the events in the record APFT, the soldier can be granted an extension to allow him or her to overcome his or her injury and return to an acceptable level of physical fitness.  If a soldier has a permanent medical condition that keeps him or her from conducting the 2 mile run, an alternate event (2.5 mile walk, 800 yd swim, or 6.2 mile bike) is taken.  There are no alternate events for the PU or SU.\n【3】 # Events\n【4】 All events are conducted in accordance with Army Standards detailed in FM 21-20. Prior to the start of each event, the standard is read aloud from the FM. Then the reader will call 'Demonstrator Post'. A soldier, usually a grader or someone not performing the test, will demonstrate the correct exercise. He or she will then demonstrate the incorrect exercise and any disqualifying behaviors noted in the FM.\n【5】 Taken from FM 21-20\n【6】 The Sit-Up: The sit-up event measures the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles. On the command \"get set,\" assume the starting position by lying on your back with your knees bent at a 90- degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is the only part of your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the backs of your hands must touch the ground. Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command \"go,\" begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.\"\n【7】 The Push-Up: The push-up event measures the endurance of the chest, shoulder, and triceps muscles. On the command ‘get set,’ assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands where they are comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles.\n【8】 On the command ‘go,’ begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, return to the starting position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and will explain to you what your mistakes are. You will then be sent to the end of the line to be retested. After the first 10 push-ups have been performed and counted, however, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly performed push-ups will not be counted. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes in which to do as many push-ups as you can.\"\n【9】 Two Mile Run: “The two-mile run is used to assess your aerobic fitness and your leg muscles’ endurance. You must complete the run without any physical help. At the start, all soldiers will line up behind the starting line. On the command ‘go,’ the clock will start. You will begin running at your own pace. You are being tested on your ability to complete the 2-mile course in the shortest time possible. Although walking is authorized, it is strongly discouraged. If you are physically helped in any way (for example, pulled, pushed, picked up, and/or carried) or leave the designated running course for any reason, you will be disqualified. (it is legal to pace a soldier during the 2-mile run. As long as there is no physical contact with the paced soldier and it does not physically hinder other soldiers taking the test, the practice of running ahead of, alongside of, or behind the tested soldier, while serving as a pacer, is permitted. Cheering or calling out the elapsed time is  permitted.) The number on your chest is for identification. You must make sure it is visible at all times. Turn in your number when you finish the run. Then, go to the area designated for the cool-down and stretch.”\n【10】 # Scoring\n【11】 Scoring on the APFT is based on sex, age and repetitions/run time for the event.  For example, a 26 year old male who does 70 PUs, 77 SUs, and runs two miles in 14:40 would be given a total score of 271; 94 points for the PUs, 96 points for the SUs, and 81 points for the run.\n【12】 A minimum of 60 points in each event is required to pass a record APFT.\n【13】 Scoring those who are required to take an alternate event is slightly different.  If a soldier is unable to take the 2-mile run, they are given an alternate event with a GO/NO GO time based on the sex and age of the individual. Their total \"score\" is computed by taking the average of the PU and SU to get the third score. For example, a 26 year old male soldier completes the walk in under the required time and does 70 PUs and 77 SUs. Their score would be 285, (94 PU points + 96 SU points)/2 + (94 PU points + 96 SU points)= 285\n【14】 Failure to pass consecutive record APFTs can ultimately lead to separation from the US Army, although this is not always the case. Soldiers who have failed an APFT are often put into a \"remedial program\", which essentially is just a second daily session of PT.  An APFT failure  results in the soldier being \"flagged\" which make them ineligible for promotion and attendance to military training and/or schools.  Per the Army Regulation governing Suspension of favourable actions (flags) AR 600-8-2 paragraph 1-15, a soldier cannot be denied an award or decoration due to APFT failure--it is a common misconception otherwise.\n【15】 A list of all the actions that are suspended can be found in AR 600-8-2 paragraph 1-14.\n【16】 APFT Badge Award: Soldiers who score 270 or above, with a minimum score of 90 in each event, are awarded the Physical Fitness Badge, which can be worn on the PT uniform. The APFT score  converts to promotion points which are used to determine the eligibility of soldiers for promotion to the ranks of Sergeants (SGTs) and Staff Sergeants (SSG).\n【17】 The scoring algorithm includes an extended scale, by which soldiers can earn more than 100 points in an event by performing better than the 100-point standard. In order for a soldier to earn a score of over 300, he or she must obtain 100 points in each event, meaning that a soldier can not begin to use the extended scale for any one event until 100 points are reached in all three events.\n", "seq_id": 7778, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-18 23:33:36"}

In order to perceive 3D shapes in these autostereograms, the brain must overcome the normally automatic coordination between focusing and vergence.\n【2】 The simplest type of autostereogram consists of horizontally repeating patterns and is known as a wallpaper autostereogram.  When viewed with proper vergence, the repeating patterns appear to float above or below the background.  The Magic Eye books feature another type of autostereogram called a random dot autostereogram. One such autostereogram is illustrated above right. In this type of autostereogram, every pixel in the image is computed from a pattern strip and a depth map. Usually, a hidden 3D scene emerges when the image is viewed with the correct vergence.\n【3】 Autostereograms are similar to normal stereograms except they are viewed without a stereoscope. A stereoscope presents 2D images of the same object from slightly different angles to the left eye and the right eye, allowing the brain to reconstruct the original object via binocular disparity. With an autostereogram, the brain receives repeating 2D patterns from both eyes, but fails to correctly match them. It pairs two adjacent patterns into a virtual object based on wrong parallax angles, thus placing the virtual object at a depth different from that of the autostereogram image.\n【4】 There are two ways an autostereogram can be viewed: wall-eyed and cross-eyed. Most autostereograms (including those in this article) are designed to be viewed in only one way, which is usually wall-eyed.  Wall-eyed viewing requires that the two eyes adopt a relatively parallel angle, while cross-eyed viewing requires a relatively convergent angle.\n【5】 # History\n【6】 In 1838, the British scientist Charles Wheatstone published an explanation of stereopsis (binocular depth perception) arising from differences in the horizontal positions of images in the two eyes. He supported his explanation by showing pictures with such horizontal differences, stereograms, separately to the left and right eyes through a stereoscope he invented based on mirrors. When people looked at these flat, two-dimensional pictures, they experienced the illusion of three-dimensional depth.\n【7】 Between 1849 and 1850, David Brewster, a Scottish scientist, improved the Wheatstone stereoscope by using lenses instead of mirrors, thus reducing the size of the contraption.\n【8】 Brewster  discovered the \"wallpaper effect\". He noticed that staring at repeated patterns in wallpapers could trick the brain into matching pairs of them as coming from the same virtual object on a virtual plane behind the walls. This is the basis of wallpaper-style \"autostereograms\" ( known as single-image stereograms).\n【9】 In 1959, Bela Julesz, a vision scientist, psychologist and MacArthur Fellow, invented the random dot stereogram while working at Bell Laboratories on recognizing camouflaged objects from aerial pictures taken by spy planes. At the time, many vision scientists still thought that depth perception occurred in the eye itself, whereas now it is known to be a complex neurological process. Julesz used a computer to create a stereo pair of random-dot images which, when viewed under a stereoscope, caused the brain to see 3D shapes.  This proved that depth perception is a neurological process.\n【10】 In 1979, Christopher Tyler of Smith-Kettlewell Institute, a student of Julesz and a visual psychophysicist, combined the theories behind single-image wallpaper stereograms and random-dot stereograms to create the first \"random-dot autostereogram\" ( known as single-image random-dot stereogram). This type of autostereogram allows a person to see 3D shapes from a single 2D image without the aid of optical equipment.\n【11】 # How they work\n【12】 ## Simple wallpaper\n【13】 Stereopsis, or stereo vision, is the visual blending of two similar but not identical images into one, with resulting visual perception of solidity and depth. In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) in one eye's view with the equivalent point (or set of points) in the other eye's view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points' positions in the otherwise inscrutable z-axis (depth).\n【14】 When the brain is presented with a repeating pattern like wallpaper, it has difficulty matching the two eyes' views accurately. By looking at a horizontally repeating pattern, but converging the two eyes at a point behind the pattern, it is possible to trick the brain into matching one element of the pattern, as seen by the left eye, with another (similar looking) element, beside the first, as seen by the right eye. With the typical wall-eyed viewing, this gives the illusion of a plane bearing the same pattern but located behind the real wall. The distance at which this plane lies behind the wall depends only on the spacing between identical elements.\n【15】 Autostereograms use this dependence of depth on spacing to create three-dimensional images. If, over some area of the picture, the pattern is repeated at smaller distances, that area will appear closer than the background plane. If the distance of repeats is longer over some area, then that area will appear more distant (like a hole in the plane).\n【16】 People who have never been able to perceive 3D shapes hidden within an autostereogram find it hard to understand remarks such as, \"the 3D image will just pop out of the background, after you stare at the picture long enough\", or \"the 3D objects will just emerge from the background\".  It helps to illustrate how 3D images \"emerge\" from the background from a second viewer's perspective.  If the virtual 3D objects reconstructed by the autostereogram viewer's brain were real objects, a second viewer observing the scene from the side would see these objects floating in the air above the background image.\n【17】 The 3D effects in the example autostereogram are created by repeating the tiger rider icons every 140 pixels on the background plane, the shark rider icons every 130 pixels on the second plane, and the tiger icons every 120 pixels on the highest plane.  The closer a set of icons are packed horizontally, the higher they are lifted from the background plane.  This repeat distance is referred to as the depth or z-axis value of a particular pattern in the autostereogram. The depth value is  known as Z-buffer value.\n【18】 The brain is capable of almost instantly matching hundreds of patterns repeated at different intervals in order to recreate correct depth information for each pattern. An autostereogram may contain some 50 tigers of varying size, repeated at different intervals against a complex, repeated background.  Yet, despite the apparent chaotic arrangement of patterns, the brain is able to place every tiger icon at its proper depth.\n【19】 ## Depth maps\n【20】 Autostereograms where patterns in a particular row are repeated horizontally with the same spacing can be read either cross-eyed or wall-eyed.  In such autostereograms, both types of reading will produce similar depth interpretation, with the exception that the cross-eyed reading reverses the depth (images that once popped out are now pushed in).\n【21】 However, icons in a row do not need to be arranged at identical intervals.  An autostereogram with varying intervals between icons across a row presents these icons at different depth planes to the viewer.  The depth for each icon is computed from the distance between it and its neighbor at the left.  These types of autostereograms are designed to be read in only one way, either cross-eyed or wall-eyed.  All autostereograms in this article are encoded for wall-eyed viewing, unless specifically marked otherwise.  An autostereogram encoded for wall-eyed viewing will produce incoherent 3D patterns when viewed cross-eyed.  Most Magic Eye pictures are  designed for wall-eyed viewing.\n【22】 The following wall-eyed autostereogram encodes 3 planes across the x-axis.  The background plane is on the left side of the picture.  The highest plane is shown on the right side of the picture.  There is a narrow middle plane in the middle of the x-axis.  Starting with a background plane where icons are spaced at 140 pixels, one can raise a particular icon by shifting it a certain number of pixels to the left.  For instance, the middle plane is created by shifting an icon 10 pixels to the left, effectively creating a spacing consisting of 130 pixels.  The brain does not rely on intelligible icons which represent objects or concepts.  In this autostereogram, patterns become smaller and smaller down the y-axis, until they look like random dots.  The brain is still able to match these random dot patterns.\n【23】 The distance relationship between any pixel and its counterpart in the equivalent pattern to the left can be expressed in a depth map.  A depth map is simply a grayscale image which represents the distance between a pixel and its left counterpart using a grayscale value between black and white.  By convention, the closer the distance is, the brighter the color becomes.\n【24】 Using this convention, a grayscale depth map for the above autostereogram can be created with black, gray and white representing shifts of 0 pixels, 10 pixels and 20 pixels, respectively.  A depth map is the key to creation of random-dot autostereograms.\n【25】 ## Random-dot\n【26】 A software program can take a depth map and an accompanying pattern image to produce an autostereogram.  The program tiles the pattern image horizontally to cover an area whose size is identical to the depth map.  Conceptually, at every pixel in the output image, the program looks up the grayscale value of the equivalent pixel in the depth map image, and uses this value to determine the amount of horizontal shift required for the pixel.\n【27】 One way to accomplish this is to make the program scan every line in the output image pixel-by-pixel from left to right.  It seeds the first series of pixels in a row from the pattern image.  Then it consults the depth map to retrieve appropriate shift values for subsequent pixels.  For every pixel, it subtracts the shift from the width of the pattern image to arrive at a repeat interval.  It uses this repeat interval to look up the color of the counterpart pixel to the left and uses its color as the new pixel's own color.\n【28】 Unlike the simple depth planes created by simple wallpaper autostereograms, subtle changes in spacing specified by the depth map can create the illusion of smooth gradients in distance.  This is possible because the grayscale depth map allows individual pixels to be placed on one of 2n depth planes, where n is the number of bits used by each pixel in the depth map.  In practice, the total number of depth planes is determined by the number of pixels used for the width of the pattern image.  Each grayscale value must be translated into pixel space in order to shift pixels in the final autostereogram.  As a result, the number of depth planes must be smaller than the pattern width.\n【29】 The fine-tuned gradient requires a pattern image more complex than standard repeating-pattern wallpaper, so typically a pattern consisting of repeated random dots is used.  When the autostereogram is viewed with proper viewing technique, a hidden 3D scene emerges. Autostereograms of this form are known as Random Dot Autostereograms.\n【30】 Smooth gradients can  be achieved with an intelligible pattern, assuming that the pattern is complex enough and does not have big, horizontal, monotonic patches.  A big area painted with monotonic color without change in hue and brightness does not lend itself to pixel shifting, as the result of the horizontal shift is identical to the original patch.  The following depth map of a shark with smooth gradient produces a perfectly readable autostereogram, even though the 2D image contains small monotonic areas; the brain is able to recognize these small gaps and fill in the blanks.  While intelligible, repeated patterns are used instead of random dots, this type of autostereogram is still known by many as a Random Dot Autostereogram, because it is created using the same process.\n【31】 ## Animated\n【32】 When a series of autostereograms are shown one after another, in the same way moving pictures are shown, the brain perceives an animated autostereogram.  If all autostereograms in the animation are produced using the same background pattern, it is often possible to see faint outlines of parts of the moving 3D object in the 2D autostereogram image without wall-eyed viewing; the constantly shifting pixels of the moving object can be clearly distinguished from the static background plane.  To eliminate this side effect, animated autostereograms often use shifting background in order to disguise the moving parts.\n【33】 When a regular repeating pattern is viewed on a CRT monitor as if it were a wallpaper autostereogram, it is usually possible to see depth ripples. This can  be seen in the background to a static, random-dot autostereogram.  These are caused by the sideways shifts in the image due to small changes in the deflection sensitivity (linearity) of the line scan, which then become interpreted as depth. This effect is especially apparent at the left hand edge of the screen where the scan speed is still settling after the flyback phase. This effect is absent from a TFT LCD.\n【34】 # Mechanisms for viewing\n【35】 Much advice exists about seeing the intended three-dimensional image in an autostereogram. While some people can simply see the 3D image in an autostereogram, others must learn to train their eyes to decouple eye convergence from lens focusing.\n【36】 Not every person can see the 3D illusion in autostereograms.  Because autostereograms are constructed based on stereo vision, persons with a variety of visual impairments, even those affecting only one eye, are unable to see the three-dimensional images.\n【37】 People with amblyopia ( known as lazy eye) are unable to see the three-dimensional images.  Children with poor or dysfunctional eyesight during a critical period in childhood may grow up stereoblind, as their brains are not stimulated by stereo images during the critical period. If such vision problem is not corrected in the early childhood, the damage becomes permanent and the adult will never be able to see autostereograms.  It is estimated that some 1% to 5% of the population is affected by amblyopia.\n【38】 ## 3D perception\n【39】 Depth perception results from many monocular and binocular visual clues. For objects relatively close to the eyes, binocular vision plays an important role in depth perception.  Binocular vision allows the brain to create a single Cyclopean image and to attach a depth level to each point in the Cyclopean image.\n【40】 The brain uses coordinate shift ( known as parallax) of matched objects to identify depth of these objects.  The depth level of each point in the combined image can be represented by a grayscale pixel on a 2D image, for the benefit of the reader.  The closer a point appears to the brain, the brighter it is painted.  Thus, the way the brain perceives depth using binocular vision can be captured by a depth map (Cyclopean image) painted based on coordinate shift.\n【41】 File:Stereogram Tut Eye\n【42】 The eye operates like a photographic camera.  It has an adjustable iris which can open (or close) to allow more (or less) light to enter the eye.  As with any camera except pinhole cameras, it needs to focus light rays entering through the iris (aperture in a camera) so that they focus on a single point on the retina in order to produce a sharp image. The eye achieves this goal by adjusting a lens behind the cornea to refract light appropriately.\n【43】 Stereo-vision based on parallax allows the brain to calculate depths of objects relative to the point of convergence.  It is the convergence angle that gives the brain the absolute reference depth value for the point of convergence from which absolute depths of all other objects can be inferred.\n【44】 ## Simulated 3D perception\n【45】 The eyes normally focus and converge at the same distance in a process known as accommodative convergence.  That is, when looking at a faraway object, the brain automatically flattens the lenses and rotates the two eyeballs for wall-eyed viewing.  It is possible to train the brain to decouple these two operations. This decoupling has no useful purpose in everyday life, because it prevents the brain from interpreting objects in a coherent manner. To see a man-made picture such as an autostereogram where patterns are repeated horizontally, however, decoupling of focusing from convergence is crucial.\n【46】 By focusing the lenses on a nearby autostereogram where patterns are repeated and by converging the eyeballs at a distant point behind the autostereogram image, one can trick the brain into seeing 3D images. If the patterns received by the two eyes are similar enough, the brain will consider these two patterns a match and treat them as coming from the same imaginary object.  This type of visualization is known as wall-eyed viewing, because the eyeballs adopt a wall-eyed convergence on a distant plane, even though the autostereogram image is actually closer to the eyes.  Because the two eyeballs converge on a plane farther away, the perceived location of the imaginary object is behind the autostereogram.  The imaginary object  appears bigger than the patterns on the autostereogram because of foreshortening.\n【47】 The following autostereogram shows 3 rows of repeated patterns.  Each pattern is repeated at a different interval to place it on a different depth plane. The two non-repeating lines can be used to verify correct wall-eyed viewing.  When the autostereogram is correctly interpreted by the brain using wall-eyed viewing, and one stares at the dolphin in the middle of the visual field, the brain should see two sets of flickering lines, as a result of binocular rivalry.\n【48】 While there are 6 dolphin patterns in the autostereogram, the brain should see 7 \"apparent\" dolphins on the plane of the autostereogram. This is a side effect of the pairing of similar patterns by the brain.  There are 5 pairs of dolphin patterns in this image. This allows the brain to create 5 apparent dolphins.  The leftmost pattern and the rightmost pattern by themselves have no partner, but the brain tries to assimilate these two patterns onto the established depth plane of adjacent dolphins despite binocular rivalry.  As a result, there are 7 apparent dolphins, with the leftmost and the rightmost ones appearing with a slight flicker, not dissimilar to the two sets of flickering lines observed when one stares at the 4th apparent dolphin.\n【49】 Because of foreshortening, the difference in convergence needed to see repeated patterns on different planes causes the brain to attribute different sizes to patterns with identical 2D sizes.  In the autostereogram of 3 rows of cubes, while all cubes have the same physical 2D dimensions, the ones on the top row appear bigger, because they are perceived as farther away than the cubes on the second and third rows.\n【50】 ## Viewing techniques\n【51】 As with a photographic camera, it is easier to make the eye focus on an object when there is intense ambient light. With intense lighting, the eye can constrict the iris, yet allow enough light to reach the retina.  The more the eye resembles a pinhole camera, the less it depends on focusing through the lens. In other words, the degree of decoupling between focusing and convergence needed to visualize an autostereogram is reduced.  This places less strain on the brain.  Therefore, it may be easier for first-time autostereogram viewers to \"see\" their first 3D images if they attempt this feat with bright lighting.\n【52】 Vergence control is important in being able to see 3D images.  Thus it may help to concentrate on converging/diverging the two eyes to shift images that reach the two eyes, instead of trying to see a clear, focused image. Although the lens adjusts reflexively in order to produce clear, focused images, voluntary control over this process is possible. The viewer alternates instead between converging and diverging the two eyes, in the process seeing \"double images\" typically seen when one is drunk or otherwise intoxicated.  Eventually the brain will successfully match a pair of patterns reported by the two eyes and lock onto this particular degree of convergence.  The brain will  adjust eye lenses to get a clear image of the matched pair.  Once this is done, the images around the matched patterns quickly become clear as the brain matches additional patterns using roughly the same degree of convergence.\n【53】 When one moves one's attention from a depth plane to another (for instance, from the top row of the chessboard to the bottom row), the two eyes need to adjust their convergence to match the new repeating interval of patterns. If the level of change in convergence is too high during this shift, sometimes the brain can lose the hard-earned decoupling between focusing and convergence. For a first-time viewer, therefore, it may be easier to see the autostereogram, if the two eyes rehearse the convergence exercise on an autostereogram where the depth of patterns across a particular row remains constant.\n【54】 In a random dot autostereogram, the 3D image is usually shown in the middle of the autostereogram against a background depth plane  the shark autostereogram).  It may help to establish proper convergence first by staring at either the top or the bottom of the autostereogram, where patterns are usually repeated at a constant interval.  Once the brain locks onto the background depth plane, it has a reference convergence degree from which it can then match patterns at different depth levels in the middle of the image.\n【55】 The majority of autostereograms, including those in this article, are designed for divergent (wall-eyed) viewing. One way to help the brain concentrate on divergence instead of focusing is to hold the picture in front of the face, with the nose touching the picture.  With the picture so close to their eyes, most people cannot focus on the picture.  The brain may give up trying to move eye muscles in order to get a clear picture.  If one slowly pulls back the picture away from the face, while refraining from focusing or rotating eyes, at some point the brain will lock onto a pair of patterns when the distance between them matches the current convergence degree of the two eyeballs.\n【56】 Another way is to stare at an object behind the picture in an attempt to establish proper divergence, while keeping part of the eyesight fixed on the picture to convince the brain to focus on the picture.  A modified method has the viewer stare at her reflection on the shiny surface of the picture, which the brain perceives as being located twice as far away as the picture itself.  This may help persuade the brain to adopt the required divergence while focusing on the nearby picture.\n【57】 For crossed-eyed autostereograms, a different approach needs to be taken. The viewer may hold one finger between his eyes and move it slowly towards the picture, maintaining his focus on the finger at all times, until he is correctly focused on the spot between him and the picture that will allow him to view the illusion.\n【58】 # Terminology\n【59】 - Stereogram\n【60】 - Random Dot Stereogram (RDS)\n【61】 - Single Image Stereogram (SIS)\n【62】 - Wallpaper autostereogram\n【63】 - Random-dot autostereogram\n【64】 - Single Image Random Text Stereogram (SIRTS)\n", "seq_id": 22839, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#58#64#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 21:52:29"}

For some people with diabetes, weight management medications and bariatric surgery may be helpful.# Introduction\n【1】 Obesity is a chronic health problem that is often progressive and difficult to treat. An estimated 80% to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes have overweight or obesity . Obesity is  becoming more prevalent in people with type 1 diabetes; one study reported a sevenfold increase in the last 20 years . In addition, intensive insulin therapy and some antihyperglycemic medications are associated with weight gain which, in turn, leads to obesity-related comorbid conditions .\n【2】 # Assessment of Overweight and Obesity\n【3】 Health Canada guidelines recommend that the initial assessment of people with diabetes should include the following measurements: height, weight, calculation of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m 2 and waist circumference (WC)  . Metabolic comorbidities are highly correlated with increasing BMI and WC .\n【4】 In people with diabetes and overweight or obesity, the reasons for the previous or current positive energy balance can often be identified. People with diabetes often take medications that are associated with weight gain; these include antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, pain relief and antidepressant agents . Assessing psychological aspects of eating behaviours, such as emotional eating, binge eating, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression, is  relevant in determining reasons for weight gain . Physical parameters that impede activity, such as osteoarthritis or dyspnea, can contribute to obesity . Comorbid conditions, such as osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can  impact the ability to lose weight .\n【5】 # Treatment of Overweight and Obesity\n【6】 The goals of therapy for people with diabetes and overweight or obesity are to achieve optimal glycemic and metabolic control and, ultimately, improve quality of life, morbidity and mortality. Attaining and maintaining a healthy body weight, and preventing weight regain, are key components of optimizing glycemic control in people with diabetes. Often people with obesity and diabetes have greater difficulty with achieving weight loss compared to people with obesity but without diabetes . Health-care providers should attempt to minimize use of weight-inducing agents without compromising glycemic control, or switch the person with diabetes to agents not associated with weight gain .\n【7】 For many people with diabetes, prevention of further weight gain is a realistic and sustainable target. A modest weight loss of 5% to Conflict of interest statements can be found on page S127. 10% of initial body weight can improve insulin sensitivity, glycemic control and blood pressure. Greater amounts of weight loss may be needed to improve OSA and dyslipidemia . The 2006 Canadian Obesity Guidelines have suggested a weight loss of 2 to 4 kg/ month . A negative energy balance of approximately 500 kcal/ day is needed to achieve this weight loss. Metabolic and physiologic adaptations following weight loss can promote weight regain and make sustained weight loss challenging . Adjustment of the caloric deficit may be required as weight loss progresses. In addition, as individuals lose weight, adjustment in antihyperglycemic medications may be required to avoid hypoglycemia .\n【8】 The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored multicentre Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, investigated the effects of lifestyle intervention on changes in weight, fitness and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and events in people with type 2 diabetes . The 8-year data revealed a 4.7% decrease in weight in the intensive lifestyle arm . This provided evidence that lifestyle changes can have a positive impact on weight change, fitness level and a decrease in medications, along with a small decrease in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and other health benefits .\n【9】 # Healthy Behaviour Interventions\n【10】 Healthy behaviour interventions are essential components of successful weight management. .\n【11】 Dietary plans for people with diabetes should be evidence based and nutritionally adequate to ensure optimal health. Specific dietary recommendations for weight loss can be found in the Nutrition Therapy chapter, p. S64. Moderate carbohydrate reduction has been beneficial in people with diabetes, demonstrating improvements in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides, blood glucose stability, and reductions in diabetes medication requirements .\n【12】 People with obesity and diabetes benefit from advice by qualified professionals on appropriate serving sizes, caloric and carbohydrate intake and how to select nutrient-rich meals, as demonstrated by the Look AHEAD Study . Programs and clinics dedicated to weight management may be beneficial, particularly those that adhere to the checklist in  .\n【13】 The effect of antihyperglycemic medication on body weight varies by class of medication. Some antihyperglycemic medications are associated with weight gain (insulin, insulin secretagogues, thiazolidinediones), and the magnitude of weight gain can vary from 4 to 9 kg or more .\n【14】 Orlistat and liraglutide are the only approved medications for chronic weight management in Canada .\n【15】 Increased WC can  be a marker for increased risk, even in persons with healthy weight.  Orlistat leads to greater weight loss when coupled with healthy behaviour interventions . It has been shown to be effective at improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes (45,. In people with obesity and IGT, orlistat  improves glucose tolerance and reduces the progression to type 2 diabetes .\n【16】 Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which acts to increase satiety and decrease hunger in the brain. While most of the blood glucose lowering benefits of liraglutide are seen at 1.8 mg per day, there is an additional dose dependent weight loss effect up to 3.0 mg per day . Liraglutide is indicated at 1.2 or 1.8 mg per day for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and at 3.0 mg per day for weight management in people with  or without type 2 diabetes . In people with type 2 diabetes, liraglutide 3.0 mg is effective to facilitate weight loss in addition to improving glycemic control and metabolic parameters, in combination with a lifestyle modification program .\n【17】 Pharmacotherapy directed at weight management has not been adequately studied in people with type 1 diabetes.\n【18】 # Bariatric Surgery\n【19】 Bariatric surgery is a therapeutic option in the management of people with type 2 diabetes and obesity. \"Bariatric surgery\" is the preferred term over \"metabolic surgery\", as the benefits encompass metabolic, mechanical and psychological improvements. These procedures can result in sustained weight loss and significant improvements in obesity-related comorbidities, including control or remission of type 2 diabetes. Surgery is a treatment option for people with BMI ≥40.0 kg/m 2 or with BMI 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m 2 in the presence of comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, who have demonstrated an inability to achieve weight loss maintenance following an adequate trial of healthy behaviour interventions and/or pharmacotherapy. Evaluation for candidacy and appropriateness for surgical procedures includes assessment by an interdisciplinary team with medical, surgical, psychiatric and nutritional expertise . The benefits and risks of bariatric surgery must be carefully considered for each individual, and candidates must be prepared to comply with lifelong medical surveillance.\n【20】 Commonly performed bariatric surgeries include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) , sleeve gastrectomy , and biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch (BPD/ BPD-DS) . These procedures lead to sustained weight loss and improvements in or remission of type 2 diabetes . The likelihood of improvement in control or remission of type 2 diabetes is higher with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy or BPD compared to gastric banding . The gastric band has largely been abandoned in North America due to less   sustained weight loss and metabolic benefits, and high surgical complication rates necessitating band removal . Predictors of likelihood of remission of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery include higher preoperative serum C-peptide, younger age, shorter duration of diabetes and lack of need for insulin therapy preoperatively . Evidence of the risks and outcomes of bariatric metabolic surgery in people with type 2 diabetes and BMI between 30 to 35 kg/m 2 is very limited and cannot be recommended at this time.\n【21】 Bariatric surgery can prevent the development and progression of albuminuria . Studies have shown variable effects of bariatric surgery on diabetic retinopathy . One study has shown that bariatric surgery may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in people with type 2 diabetes . Bariatric surgery has not been adequately studied in people with type 1 diabetes\n【22】 # Author Disclosures\n【23】 Dr. Wharton reports personal fees from Novo Nordisk, Janssen, Lilly, Merck, and Valeant, outside the submitted work.

If the chamber is not mentioned, it is usually assumed to be the left ventricle.\n【4】 Preload is theoretically most accurately described as the initial stretching of a single cardiac myocyte prior to contraction. This cannot be measured in vivo and therefore other measurements are used as estimates. Estimation is inaccurate, for example in a chronically dilated ventricle new sarcomeres may have formed in the heart muscle allowing the relaxed ventricle to appear enlarged. The term end-diastolic volume is better suited to the clinic, although not exactly equivalent to the laboratory term preload.\n【5】 Quantitatively, preload can be calculated as (LVEDP - LVEDR)/ 2h, where LVEDP=Left Ventricular end diastolic pressure, LVEDR= Left ventricular end diastolic radius (at the ventricle's midpoint), and h=thickness of the ventricle. This calculation is based on the Law of Laplace\n【6】 Preload is affected by venous blood pressure and the rate of venous return. These are affected by venous tone and volume of circulating blood.\n【7】 Preload relates to the ventricular end-diastolic volume: a higher end-diastolic volume implies a higher preload, but the relationship is not simple, because of the restriction of the term preload to single myocytes. Single myocytes are not connected simply, but in an interdigitated manner.\n【8】 Preload increases with exercise (slightly), increasing blood volume (overtransfusion) and excitement (sympathetics).\n【9】 # Factors & conditions increased ventricular filling and therefore preload\n【10】 1.Increased central venous pressure (CVP) that can result from decreased venous compliance (e.g., caused by sympathetic venoconstriction) or increased thoracic blood volume.\n【11】 The latter can be increased by either increased total blood volume or by venous return augmented by increased respiratory activity, increased skeletal muscle pump activity, or gravity (e.g., head-down tilt).\n【12】 2.Increased ventricular compliance, which results in a greater expansion of the chamber during filling at a given filling pressure.\n【13】 3.Increased atrial force of contraction resulting from sympathetic stimulation of the atria or from increased filling of the atria and therefore increased atrial contractile force through the Frank-Starling mechanism.\n【14】 4.Reduced heart rate, which increases ventricular filling time.\n【15】 5.Increased aortic pressure, which increases the afterload on the ventricle, reduces stroke volume by increasing end-systolic volume, and leads to a secondary increase in preload.\n【16】 6.Pathological conditions such as ventricular systolic failure and valve defects such as aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (pulmonary valve stenosis and regurgitation have similar effects on right ventricular preload).\n【17】 # Factors & conditions decreased preload\n【18】 1.Decreased venous blood pressure, most commonly resulting from reduced blood volume (e.g., hemorrhage) or gravity causing blood to pool in the lower limbs when standing upright.\n【19】 2.Impaired atrial contraction that can result from atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.\n【20】 3.Increased heart rate (e.g., atrial tachycardia), which reduces ventricular filling time.\n【21】 4.Decreased ventricular afterload, which enhances forward flow (i.e., ejection) thereby reducing end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume secondarily.\n【22】 5.Ventricular diastolic failure (decreased ventricular compliance) caused, for example, by ventricular hypertrophy or impaired relaxation (lusitropy).\n【23】 6.Inflow (mitral and tricuspid) valve stenosis, which reduces ventricular filling.\n", "seq_id": 17016, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:13:34"}

However, fitness for surgery and the number, location and size of the metastases may dictate the use of alternative treatment options. These include systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal ablation, chemoembolisation and selective internal radiation therapy.

It may  be used as an adjunct to hepatic resection to ablate small-volume disease in the future remnant liver.\n【8】 # Outline of the procedure\n【9】 A percutaneous or intraoperative approach may be used, with the patient under local or general anaesthesia.

It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\n【31】 NICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【32】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【33】 It updates and replaces NICE interventional procedure guidance 92.\n【34】 This guidance has been incorporated into the NICE pathway on colorectal cancer, along with other related guidance and products.\n【35】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is  available.\n【36】 Changes since publication\n【37】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【38】 Your responsibility\n【39】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include constipation, xerostomia, dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, fatigue.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 ### Depression\n【9】 - 100-200 mg/day PO, single or divided doses\n【10】 - Maximum 300 mg/day\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【13】 There is limited information about Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Desipramine in adult patients.\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【15】 ### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n【16】 - Safety and efficacy not established in the pediatric age group\n【17】 - 25 mg/day PO, maximum 5 mg/kg/day\n【18】 ### Diabetic neuropathy\n【19】 - 100-200 mg/day\n【20】 - There is limited information about Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Desipramine in adult patients.\n【21】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【22】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【23】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【24】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【25】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【26】 There is limited information about Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Desipramine in pediatric patients.\n【27】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【28】 There is limited information about Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Desipramine in pediatric patients.\n【29】 # Contraindications\n【30】 - The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desipramine or within 14 days of stopping treatment with desipramine is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.\n【31】 - The use of desipramine within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is  contraindicated.\n【32】 - Starting desipramine in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is  contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.\n【33】 - desipramine is contraindicated in the acute recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug.\n【34】 - Cross-sensitivity between this and other dibenzazepines is a possibility.\n【35】 # Warnings\n【36】 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk\n【37】 - Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18– with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\n【38】 - The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications.\n【39】 -\n【40】 Age Range\tDrug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated\n【41】 Increases Compared to Placebo\n【42】 < 18\t14 additional cases\n【43】 18–24\t5 additional cases\n【44】 Decreases Compared to Placebo\n【45】 25–64\t1 fewer case\n【46】 ≥65\t6 fewer cases\n【47】 - No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n【48】 - It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n【49】 - All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.\n【50】 - The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n【51】 - Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n【52】 - Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n【53】 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder\n【54】 - A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that desipramine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.\n【55】 Serotonin Syndrome\n【56】 - The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and  others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).\n【57】 - Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.\n【58】 - The concomitant use of desipramine with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. desipramine should  not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking desipramine. desipramine should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI .\n【59】 - If concomitant use of desipramine\twith other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.\n【60】 - Treatment with desipramine and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\n【61】 Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given in the following situations:\n【62】 - In patients with cardiovascular disease, because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction.\n【63】 - In patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac conduction disturbances.\n【64】 - In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the anticholinergic properties of the drug.\n【65】 - In patients with thyroid disease or those taking thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias.\n【66】 - In patients with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure threshold. Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients.\n【67】 - This drug is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds.\n【68】 - The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.\n【69】 - In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage.\n【70】 # Adverse Reactions\n【71】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【72】 Central Nervous System\n【73】 Cardiovascular\n【74】 Gastrointestinal\n【75】 Hypersensitive Reactions\n【76】 Psychiatric\n【77】 Anticholinergic\n【78】 Endocrine\n【79】 Miscellaneous\n【80】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【81】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【82】 # Drug Interactions\n【83】 - Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6\n【84】 - The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called \"poor metabolizers\"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).\n【85】 - In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type IC antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the SSRIs, e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and  in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).\n【86】 - Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6.\n【87】 - Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.\n【88】 - Anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.\n【89】 - Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when this drug is given concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.\n【90】 - Alcoholic beverages\n【91】 - Patients should be warned that while taking this drug their response to alcoholic beverages may be exaggerated.\n【92】 - psychotropic agents.\n【93】 - If desipramine is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive. Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the major tranquilizers are  additive to those of desipramine.\n【94】 - MAOIs interactions.\n【95】 - Concomitant use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) and serotonergic drugs may potentially cause life threatening adverse events .\n【96】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【97】 ### Pregnancy\n【98】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【99】 Safe use of desipramine during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive.\n【100】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【101】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Desipramine in women who are pregnant.\n【102】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【103】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Desipramine during labor and delivery.\n【104】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【105】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine in women who are nursing.\n【106】 ### Pediatric Use\n【107】 - Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. Therefore, desipramine (desipramine hydrochloride) is not recommended for use in children.\n【108】 - Anyone considering the use of desipramine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.\n【109】 ### Geriatic Use\n【110】 - Clinical studies of desipramine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients.\n【111】 - The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging.\n【112】 - This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n【113】 - desipramine use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as confusional states.\n【114】 ### Gender\n【115】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine with respect to specific gender populations.\n【116】 ### Race\n【117】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine with respect to specific racial populations.\n【118】 ### Renal Impairment\n【119】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine in patients with renal impairment.\n【120】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【121】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【122】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【123】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Desipramine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【124】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【125】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Desipramine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【126】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【127】 ### Administration\n【128】 - Not recommended for use in children.\n【129】 - Lower dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents. Lower dosages are  recommended for outpatients compared to hospitalized patients, who are closely supervised. Dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased according to clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a period of time and should be at the lowest dose that will maintain remission.\n【130】 - Usual Adult Dose\n【131】 The usual adult dose is 100 to 200 mg per day. In more severely ill patients, dosage may be further increased gradually to 300 mg/day if necessary. Dosages above 300 mg/day are not recommended.\n【132】 Dosage should be initiated at a lower level and increased according to tolerance and clinical response.\n【133】 Treatment of patients requiring as much as 300 mg should generally be initiated in hospitals, where regular visits by the physician, skilled nursing care, and frequent electrocardiograms (ECGs) are available.\n【134】 The best available evidence of impending toxicity from very high doses of desipramine is prolongation of the QRS or QT intervals on the ECG. Prolongation of the PR interval is  significant, but less closely correlated with plasma levels. Clinical symptoms of intolerance, especially drowsiness, dizziness, and postural hypotension, should  alert the physician to the need for reduction in dosage.\n【135】 - Initial therapy may be administered in divided doses or a single daily dose.\n【136】 - Maintenance therapy may be given on a once-daily schedule for patient convenience and compliance.\n【137】 - Adolescent and Geriatric Dose\n【138】 The usual adolescent and geriatric dose is 25 to 100 mg daily.\n【139】 Dosage should be initiated at a lower level and increased according to tolerance and clinical response to a usual maximum of 100 mg daily. In more severely ill patients, dosage may be further increased to 150 mg/day. Doses above 150 mg/day are not recommended in these age groups.\n【140】 - Initial therapy may be administered in divided doses or a single daily dose.\n【141】 - Maintenance therapy may be given on a once-daily schedule for patient convenience and compliance.\n【142】 - Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders\n【143】 At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with desipramine. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping desipramine before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders .\n【144】 - Use of desipramine With Other MAOI's Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue\n【145】 Do not start desipramine in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered.\n【146】 In some cases, a patient already receiving desipramine therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient,desipramine should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with desipramine may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.\n【147】 The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with desipramine is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use.\n【148】 ### Monitoring\n【149】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine Monitoring in the drug label.\n【150】 # IV Compatibility\n【151】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Desipramine and IV administrations.\n【152】 # Overdosage\n【153】 Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Overdose of desipramine has resulted in a higher death rate compared to overdoses of other tricyclic antidepressants. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic antidepressant overdose. As the management is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose; therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. There is no specific antidote for desipramine overdosage.\n【154】 - Oral LD50\n【155】 The oral LD50 of desipramine is 290 mg/kg in male mice and 320 mg/kg in female rats.\n【156】 Manifestations of Overdosage\n【157】 Critical manifestations of overdose inclu\n【158】 Other signs of overdose may inclu\n【159】 - Management: Aggressive supportive care and serum alkalinization are the mainstays of therapy.\n【160】 - General: Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient's airway, establish an intravenous line, and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of 6 hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is required. Follow ECG, renal function, CPK, and arterial blood gasses as clinically indicated. There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after overdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death, and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient.\n【161】 - Gastrointestinal Decontamination: Emesis is contraindicated. Activated charcoal should be administered to patients who present early after an overdose.\n【162】 - Cardiovascular: A maximal limb-lead QRS duration widening to greater than 100 msec is a significant indicator of toxicity, specifically for the risk of seizures and, eventually, cardiac dysrhythmias. Serum alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (as needed) should be instituted in patients manifesting significant toxicity such as QRS widening. Dysrhythmias despite adequate alkalemia may respond to overdrive pacing, beta-agonist infusions, and magnesium therapy. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (eg, quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).\n【163】 - CNS: In patients with CNS depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines. If these are ineffective or seizures recur, other anticonvulsants (eg, phenobarbital, propofol) may be used.\n【164】 - Psychiatric Follow-up: Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate.\n【165】 - Pediatric Management: The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.\n【166】 # Pharmacology\n【167】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【168】 Available evidence suggests that many depressions have a biochemical basis in the form of a relative deficiency of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine deficiency may be associated with relatively low urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG) levels, while serotonin deficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.\n【169】 While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests that they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, including desipramine, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have greater effect on serotonin re-uptake.\n【170】 desipramine is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and does not act primarily as a central nervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in 2 to 5 days, but full treatment benefit usually requires 2 to 3 weeks to obtain.\n【171】 ## Structure\n【172】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【173】 Tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine hydrochloride, are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tricyclic antidepressants or their metabolites are to some extent excreted through the gastric mucosa and reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Desipramine is metabolized in the liver, and approximately 70% is excreted in the urine.\n【174】 The rate of metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants varies widely from individual to individual, chiefly on a genetically determined basis. Up to a 36-fold difference in plasma level may be noted among individuals taking the same oral dose of desipramine. The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging.\n【175】 Certain drugs, particularly the psychostimulants and the phenothiazines, increase plasma levels of concomitantly administered tricyclic antidepressants through competition for the same metabolic enzyme systems. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon discontinuation of cimetidine, which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant. Other substances, particularly barbiturates and alcohol, induce liver enzyme activity and thereby reduce tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels. Similar effects have been reported with tobacco smoke.\n【176】 Research on the relationship of plasma level to therapeutic response with the tricyclic antidepressants has produced conflicting results. While some studies report no correlation, many studies cite therapeutic levels for most tricyclics in the range of 50 to 300 nanograms per milliliter. The therapeutic range is different for each tricyclic antidepressant. For desipramine, an optimal range of therapeutic plasma levels has not been established.\n【177】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【178】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine Pharmacokinetics in the drug label.\n【179】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【180】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n【181】 # Clinical Studies\n【182】 There is limited information regarding Desipramine Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n【183】 # How Supplied\n【184】 10 mg blue coated tablets imprinted 68-7\n【185】 NDC 0068-0007-01: bottles of 100\n【186】 25 mg yellow coated tablets imprinted desipramine 25\n【187】 NDC 0068-0011-01: bottles of 100\n【188】 50 mg green coated tablets imprinted desipramine 50\n【189】 NDC 0068-0015-01: bottles of 100\n【190】 75 mg orange coated tablets imprinted desipramine 75\n【191】 NDC 0068-0019-01: bottles of 100\n【192】 100 mg peach coated tablets imprinted desipramine 100\n【193】 NDC 0068-0020-01: bottles of 100\n【194】 150 mg white coated tablets imprinted desipramine 150\n【195】 NDC 0068-0021-50: bottles of 50\n【196】 ## Storage\n【197】 Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15–30°C (59–86°F) .

A patient Medication Guide about \"Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions\" is available for desipramine.

In older children and adults, HA is typically symptomatic. Older persons, and individuals with chronic liver disease and immunocompromising conditions, have an increased risk of progressing to fulminant hepatic failure resulting in death.\n【12】 # I. INTRODUCTION\n【13】 NACI currently recommends pre-exposure immunization of persons at increased risk of infection or severe hepatitis A (HA) infection as defined in the Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG). Although not authorized for children less than 12 months of age in Canada, HA vaccine has previously been used in some First Nations communities starting at 6 months of age and in infants travelling to high risk areas.\n【14】 For post-exposure prophylaxis, NACI recommends that HA vaccine should be offered to household and close contacts of proven or suspected cases of HA, as well as co-workers and clients of infected food handlers and staff and attendees of group child care centres and kindergartens when HA has occurred in them. NACI recommends the use of human immune globulin (Ig) in circumstances when protection against hepatitis A infection is required in addition to or in the absence of immunization with HA vaccine. Specific HA antibody content in Ig is not regulated by Health Canada and therefore concentrations of HA antibody may be declining due to lower levels of antibody in the general population as a result of decreased rates of natural infection. This statement will serve as an update to previous statements and will provide the evidence used to determine the optimal timing of immunization with a HA containing vaccine by:\n【15】 - Providing a review of the evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of HA vaccine when administered to infants from 6 to 12 months of age and making recommendations for the immunization of individuals in this age group  Reviewing evidence pertaining to the administration of HA vaccine to individuals with non-malignant hematologic disorders  Reviewing evidence pertaining to post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in individuals with chronic liver disease and adults over 50 years of age\n【16】 # II. METHODS\n【17】 The NACI Hepatitis Working Group (HWG) reviewed key issues concerning the currently recommended immunization schedules for HA-containing vaccines approved for use in Canada, with particular consideration given to immunogenicity and safety when a HA-containing vaccine was provided to infants between 6 and 12 months of age. Under HWG supervision, knowledge synthesis was performed by a medical advisor at the Agency. Using key words \"hepatitis A\" AND \"vaccine\", studies evaluating safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in infants immunized between 6 and 12 months of age with an inactivated HA-containing vaccine were assessed. Following the critical appraisal of individual studies, summary tables with ratings of the quality of the evidence were prepared using NACI's methodological hierarchy .\n【18】 NACI reviewed such considerations as: the target population; safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness of the vaccines; vaccine schedules; and other aspects of the overall immunization principles and strategy for the use of this vaccine. NACI HWG Chair and an Agency medical advisor presented the evidence and proposed recommendations to NACI. Following the review of the evidence and consultation at the NACI meeting on February 4, 2015, the committee voted on specific recommendations. The description of relevant considerations, rationale for specific decisions, and knowledge gaps are described in the text of this update.\n【19】 # III. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HEPATITIS A\n【20】 The severity of HA increases with age and can range from asymptomatic or a short and mild illness, to a severely disabling disease lasting several months. Children less than six years of age are commonly asymptomatic or present with mild disease without jaundice, and represent an important source of infection, particularly for household members and other close contacts.\n【21】 In older children and adults, HA is typically symptomatic, with the majority of individuals developing anorexia, nausea, fatigue, fever and jaundice, usually lasting less than two months.\n【22】 Older persons, and individuals with chronic liver disease and immunocompromising conditions, have an increased risk of progressing to fulminant hepatic failure resulting in death.  Although approximately 25% of adult cases in Canada are hospitalized, deaths from HA are rarely reported. Between 2006 and 2010, only eight deaths from HA were reported to Vital Statisti\n【23】 Information on HA antibody seroprevalence in Canada is available through published research studies and the first cycle (2007 to  of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). (3, Based on the available CHMS data, prevalence of protective HA antibodies has been estimated to be 17.3% (95% CI: 11.   There is currently no information available about HA seroprevalence in children less than 12 months of age.  Hepatitis A is the most common vaccine preventable disease in travellers. The risk of HA for susceptible travellers to developing countries is estimated to range from 0.1/1000 to 1/1,000 per month. The risk may be much higher for low-budget travellers, volunteer humanitarian workers and immigrants visiting friends and relatives in their homelands, who may be eating in less hygienic conditions.\n【24】 There is no change in vaccines currently authorized and available in Canada. Additional details about the types and contents of HA-containing vaccines available for use in Canada are provided in the CIG .  IV.1 Efficacy and effectiveness\n【25】 No studies on the efficacy or effectiveness of HA-containing vaccines in children 6 to 12 months of age were identified through the literature search.\n【26】 # IV.2 Immunogenicity\n【27】 A total of eight studies that included participants less than one year of age were reviewed by HWG and NACI. A full review of all studies, their methodologies and outcome measures, can be found in a. Additionally, two confidential Clinical Study Report (CSR) synopses were  provided by the vaccine manufacturer. Information from the reviewed CSR synopses was determined to be consistent with the other published data reviewed by the HWG.\n【28】 In a randomized controlled trial conducted by Bell  immune responses of 82 infants vaccinated with HA vaccine at 6 and 12 months of age (Group  were compared to children who were immunized at 12 and 18 or 15 and 21 months of age (Groups 2 and 3, respectively). Seroresponse (proportion of children achieving seroprotection defined by study authors as titre ≥33 mIU/ml and GMC values) was analysed in relation to maternal HA antibody status. Following the receipt of the first vaccine dose, all children in all groups achieved and maintained seroprotection throughout the study period, except for 2 infants in Group 1 born to anti-HAVpositive mothers. While no statistically significant differences in GMC between the three groups were observed among children born to anti-HAV-negative mothers, children born to anti-HAV-positive mothers in Group 1 had significantly lower GMC than those in Groups 2 and 3 at all blood draws. A subgroup analysis showed higher GMC values following the second vaccine dose in Group 1 infants born to susceptible, compared to those born to seropositive mothers. These subgroup differences were not observed in Groups 2 and 3. When interpreting the results of the study, it is important to note the relatively small number of participants in Group 1, high seroprotective HA antibody titre threshold used by the authors, as well as high HA incidence and younger average maternal age in the geographic area where the study was conducted.\n【29】 Long term immunogenicity results of the study by Bell were subsequently reported by Sharapov  who used a lower protective antibody cut-off level (titre ≥10 mIU/ml) than in the original study. Although a lower threshold for seroprotection resulted in all study participants achieving seroprotection one month after dose two, lower GMC values were noted at all time points for children in Group 1 compared to Groups 2 or 3, as well as for children born to anti-HAV-positive mothers compared to those born to anti-HAV-negative mothers. At 10 years, all but 7% of Group 1 children born to anti-HAV-negative mothers, 11% of Group 1 children born to anti-HAV-positive mothers, and 4% of Group 3 children born to anti-HAV-positive mothers maintained protective antibody levels.\n【30】 Immune response of children born to anti-HAV-positive mothers was  assessed in a clinical trial by Lagos  In the study, 91 seropositive children either received a first dose of HA vaccine at 6 months of age concomitantly with other routine infant vaccines, or two weeks following routine infant immunization; dose 2 was provided at 12 months of age. One month after dose one, seroprotection (defined as titre ≥20 mIU/ml) was achieved by all participants and both groups achieved more than a 22 fold increase in GMT values.\n【31】 In a similar study, Stojanov  randomized 619 infants to receive HA vaccine separately (months 7 and  or concomitantly (months 6 and  with other routine vaccines. Comparison of infants according to pre-vaccination HA antibody status (protective antibody titre defined as ≥10 mIU/ml) showed a pre-and post-booster response of similar magnitude, but significantly lower GMT values in initially seropositive infants. One month after dose 2, all infants achieved protective antibody levels, independent of initial HA antibody status.\n【32】 Letson  evaluated the immune response in 123 infants who were randomized according to maternal HA antibody status to receive HA vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infants of both anti-HAV-positive and -negative mothers) or HA vaccine at 8 and 10 months of age (12 infants born to anti-HAV-positive mothers). In the latter group, at 15 months of age, no statistical differences in seroprotective levels (antibody titre >20 mIU/mL) were observed among infants who were seronegative (n= and those who were seropositive (n= at the time of vaccination (128 mIU/mL vs 72 mIU/mL, p=0..\n【33】 Lopez  conducted a study of 131 infants who received either three doses of HA vaccine at 2, 4, 6 months of age or one dose at 6 months of age, and a booster dose at 15-18 months of age. Seroprotective levels (defined as titre ≥20 mIU/ml) were achieved by all 30 participants who received the initial vaccine at 6 months of age, at one month following both primary and booster immunization, independent of prior antibody status (10% were seronegative at the time of enrolment). A 34-fold increase in pre-and post-booster GMC values was  observed among these study participants.\n【34】 Usonis  measured immune responses of 60 children following the receipt of the first dose of HA vaccine at either 5 to 10 months of age or 4 to 7 years of age, with a booster provided 12 months later. Half of the 26 infants who received a booster dose were seronegative (seroprotection defined as antibody titre ≥20 mIU/ml) prior to primary immunization. All infants achieved and maintained seroprotective antibody titers for the duration of the study, independent of the presence of maternal antibodies, with no statistically significant differences in antibody levels between the groups at month 12. Although the increase in GMT values following booster immunization was approximately four-fold higher in infants without maternal antibodies than in infants with maternal antibodies at baseline, all infants achieved more than fifty-fold higher antibody levels than those considered to be protective by the study authors.\n【35】 In a study of 1084 children, Nolan  compared immune responses of 218 children allocated to receive 2 doses of HA vaccine, starting at 11 to 13 months of age to children receiving the first dose of HA vaccine at 15 to 18 or 23 to 25 months of age. All children in all age groups reached seroprotective levels (defined as titre ≥15 mIU/ml) one month after dose 2. Seroresponse based on GMC values was found by authors to be equivalent between vaccine responders in the 11 to 13 and 23 to 25 month age groups.\n【36】 There are limited data regarding HA vaccine immunogenicity in adults over the age of 40 years.  In a study by Briem immune responses were compared between 200 adults 20-39 years of age (Group  and 40 to 62 years of age (Group II). Although 15 days post vaccination, Group 1 achieved higher seroresponse rates than Group 2 (90% vs. 77%), at month 1 post-vaccination a seropositivity (titre ≥20 mIU/ml) rate of 97% was observed in both groups. Another study by D'Acremont  that compared immune responses among 53 adults 18-45 years of age with 16 adults 50-60 years of age found higher seropositivity (titre ≥20 mIU/ml) in the younger age group (100% vs. 70%). In a study by Scheifele  in which 57 adults 40-61 years of age were provided with a pediatric dose of HA vaccine (HAVRIX  pediatric), seroprotection (titre ≥20 mIU/ml) was achieved by 89% of study participants one month following initial immunization and all participants one month after the receipt of the second dose.\n【37】 Three studies  assessing the immunogenicity of HA vaccine in individuals with chronic liver disease were reviewed by the HWG. In a study conducted by Keeffe  immune response was compared between healthy adults and adults with chronic liver disease. Although the extent of liver damage in study participants did correlate to vaccine response, GMC values and seroconversion rates (titre ≥33 mIU/ml) after the first dose of HA vaccine were found to be statistically lower in adults with chronic liver disease. Similarly, in a study of 22 adult patients with liver failure and liver transplants conducted by Dumont seroconversion rates of 0% and 50% respectively, were much lower than those historically observed in healthy individuals.\n【38】 In another non-randomized control study conducted by Fereirra  statistically lower seroconversion rates (p<0. were observed in children 1 to 16 years of age with chronic liver failure (76%), compared to healthy, age matched, children (94%).\n【39】 It should be noted that, although immunity to HAV, by convention, has been established as IgG anti-HAV antibody titre above 10-20 mIU/ml (depending on the immunoassay used), the absolute lower limit of protective antibody level has not been determined.  It is  important to note that antibody levels induced by immunization have generally been observed to be lower in comparison to those induced by natural infection.  Available studies have primarily measured immune responses in children born to mothers who acquired antibodies through natural infection with HAV. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate the findings from these studies to children born to immunized anti-HAV positive mothers is limited.\n【40】 Review of all immunogenicity studies, their methodologies and outcome measures can be found in Tables 3a, 4 and 5.\n【41】 # IV.3 Safety\n【42】 Safety data for HA vaccine in infants 6 to 12 months of age were obtained from six of the reviewed studies. A review of these studies, their methodologies and outcome measures can be found in b.\n【43】 Similar to the safety and reactogenicity of HA vaccines in older subjects, the most frequently reported adverse event in infants 6 to 12 months of age was injection site reaction, with the majority of symptoms described as mild or moderate and resolving within 1 to 2 days after vaccination.\n【44】 # V. RECOMMENDATIONS\n【45】 Comparable to the results reported in clinical trials of children more than 12 months of age, all reviewed studies have consistently shown that vaccination of infants 6 to 12 months of age with inactivated HA vaccines is immunogenic and safe. Following the receipt of two doses, seroprotection (as defined by study authors) was achieved, independent of age, schedule used or initial HA serological status. When the vaccine was provided to seronegative infants, immune response and long-term antibody levels were comparable to those achieved following immunization at an older age. In all infants born to seropositive mothers, despite lower antibody levels that were observed following immunization, booster vaccination elicited a robust anamnestic response, suggesting good priming and an established immune memory potential despite maternal antibody interference. However, because of very low rates of anti-HA seropositivity as a result of natural infection among women of reproductive age in Canada, potential concerns regarding maternal antibody interference are likely not to represent a significant issue. Recommendations 1 to 3 pertain to products which have been approved for use in children one year of age.\n【46】 Recommendation 1: HA vaccine may be provided, beginning at six months of age, to infants who are at increased risk of infection or severe HA. (NACI recommendation Grade B)\n【47】 Infants at increased risk of severe HA infection may include those with an underlying liver disease of idiopathic, metabolic, infectious or cholestatic etiology. Canadian-born infants travelling to HA endemic countries, including children of new Canadians returning to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives, may be at increased risk of HA infection.\n【48】 Recommendation 2: HA vaccine may be provided to infants beginning at six months of age, who are living in a household with an individual who is at increased risk of infection or severe HA.\n【49】 (NACI recommendation Grade B)\n【50】 Recommendation 3: For post-exposure prophylaxis, unless contraindicated or unavailable, HA vaccine is recommended in preference to Ig for healthy individuals six months of age and older.\n【51】 # (NACI recommendation Grade B)\n【52】 Because the HA antibody content of Ig is assumed to decrease over time as a result of lower population-level antibody levels (due to lower rates of natural infection), and because of an excellent safety profile of inactivated HA-containing vaccine, immunization is preferred over the administration of a blood-derived product.\n【53】 Recommendation 4: Immunization with HA vaccine may be considered for all individuals receiving repeated replacement of plasma-derived clotting factors. (NACI recommendation Grade I)\n【54】 The solvent-detergent (S/D) method used to prepare plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates does not reliably inactivate the HA virus. However, historically there has been no evidence of HA transmission from plasma-derived clotting factor in Canada and the risk of transfusion-related HA is extremely low because all pooled plasma is tested for HA. Due to a theoretical possibility of infection, immunization of individuals receiving large quantities of plasma-derived clotting factors may be considered. In Canada, product monographs of all S/D plasma-derived products used in the treatment of conditions requiring clotting factor substitution include recommendations for HA immunization.\n【55】 Recommendation 5: For post-exposure prophylaxis within 14 days of exposure of susceptible adults 60 years of age and older who are household or close contacts of a case, Ig may be provided in addition to HA vaccine. (NACI recommendation Grade I)\n【56】 Individuals without a history of disease or previous immunization are susceptible to HA infection. Evidence is suggestive of reduced immunogenic response to HA vaccine, as well as of higher HA infection-related hospitalization and case fatality rates with increasing age. However, due to significant uncertainty about the incremental value of passive immunization on disease outcomes, (including Ig HA antibody content), high HA antibody prevalence in older age groups and a small number of cases of HA infection-related complications in individuals over 60 years of age, the decision to include Ig for post-exposure HA prophylaxis should be made on a caseby-case basis. Given the lack of data to support benefit of Ig after 14 days, there is no recommendation for its use after this time period. Post exposure prophylaxis with vaccine alone is recommended for outbreak response.\n【57】 Recommendation 6: For post-exposure prophylaxis of susceptible individuals with chronic liver disease, Ig should be provided within 14 days of exposure in addition to HA vaccine. (NACI recommendation Grade B)\n【58】 Because of the risk of severe disease and a suboptimal immune response to HA vaccine among individuals who are immunocompromised and with chronic liver disease, Ig is recommended to provide immediate protection against HA infection until an active response to the vaccine is produced. Given the lack of data to support benefit of Ig after 14 days, there is no recommendation for its use after this time period.\n【59】 # VI.

Fever of 1 day's duration was reported by 12% of participants after either vaccine dose; fever of at least 3 days' duration was uncommon (0-6%). No differences between three groups were reported. The observed incidence of injection-site reactions at the HA vaccine site was generally similar between the two groups (8.9% versus 10.0%following dose 1 and 7.1% versus 12.5% following dose 2 in Groups 1 versus 2, respectively).\n【65】 # Infants born to anti-HA-positive mothers\n【66】 # Level I Fair\n【67】 # STUDY DETAILS SUMMARY\n【68】 After the 6-month visit, systemic events were reported by 39.9% of subjects in Group 1 and 42.7% in Group 2.\n【69】 After the 12-month visit, systemic events were reported by 43.0% of subjects in Group 1 and 41.7% in Group 2.\n【70】 Overall, within 14 days after the first three vaccination visits, fever was reported in 21.8% of subjects in Group 1 and 21.3% in Group 2.

He, James D. Watson  and Maurice Wilkins were jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\" .\n【3】 His later work, until 1977, at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, has not received as much formal recognition. Crick is widely known for use of the term “central dogma” to summarize an idea that genetic information flow in cells is essentially one-way, from DNA to RNA to protein. Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played an important role in research related to revealing the genetic code.\n【4】 During the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained in this post until his death; \"he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a scientist until the bitter end\" said Christof Koch.\n【5】 # Biography, family and education\n【6】 Francis Crick, the first son of Harry and Annie Elizabeth Crick (nee Wilkins), was born and raised in Weston Favell, then a small village on the edge of the English town of Northampton in which Crick’s father and uncle ran the family’s boot and shoe factory. At an early age, he was attracted to science and what he could learn about it from books. As a child, he was taken to church by his parents, but by about age 12 he told his mother that he no longer wanted to attend. Crick preferred the scientific search for answers over belief in any dogma. He was educated at Northampton Grammar School (now Northampton School For Boys) and, after the age of 14, Mill Hill School in London (on scholarship), where he studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry. At the age of 21, Crick earned a B.Sc. degree in physics from University College London (UCL)  after he had failed to gain his intended place at a Cambridge college, probably through failing their requirement for Latin; his contemporaries in British DNA research Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins both went up to Cambridge colleges, to Newnham and St. John's respectively. Crick later became a PhD student and Honorary Fellow of\n【7】 Caius College and mainly worked at the Cavendish Laboratory and MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. He was  an Honorary Fellow of Churchill College and of U.C.L., London.\n【8】 Crick began a Ph.D. research project on measuring viscosity of water at high temperatures (what he later described as \"the dullest problem imaginable\") in the laboratory of physicist Edward Neville da Costa Andrade, but with the outbreak of World War II - in particular, an incident during the Battle of Britain when a bomb fell through the roof of the laboratory and destroyed his experimental apparatus  - Crick was deflected from a possible career in physics.\n【9】 During World War II, he worked for the Admiralty Research Laboratory, from which emerged a group of many notable scientists; he worked on the design of magnetic and acoustic mines and was instrumental in designing a new mine that was effective against German minesweepers.\n【10】 After World War II, in 1947, Crick began studying biology and became part of an important migration of physical scientists into biology research. This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as John Randall, who had helped win the war with inventions such as radar. Crick had to adjust from the \"elegance and deep simplicity\" of physics to the \"elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years.\" He described this transition as, \"almost as if one had to be born again.\" According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important—hubris—and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should  be possible in other sciences such as biology. Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics.\n【11】 For the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of cytoplasm at Cambridge's Strangeways Laboratory, headed by Honor Bridget Fell, with a Medical Research Council studentship, until he joined Perutz and Kendrew at the Cavendish Laboratory. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of Sir Lawrence Bragg, a Nobel Prize winner in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, Linus Pauling, to the discovery of DNA's structure (after having been 'pipped-at-the-post' by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was  effectively competing with King's College London, which was under Sir John Randall. (Randall had turned down Francis Crick from working at King's College London.) Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King's College London were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the friendship between Crick and James Watson. Crick and Wilkins first met at King's College London and not as erroneously reported at the Admiralty during World War II.\n【12】 - Spouses: 1# Ruth Doreen Crick, nee Dodd (b. 1913, m. 18 February 1940 - ; 2# Odile Crick, nee Speed (b. 11 August 1920, m. 14 August 1949 - 28 July 2004, d. 5 July\n【13】 - Children: Michael b.

March 1954 ;\n【14】 - Grandchildren: Alex, Camberley, Francis, Kindra (Michael & Barbara Crick's children) and Jacqueline Nichols' children Mark and Nicholas.\n【15】 Crick died of colon cancer on 28 July 2004 at The University of California's San Diego Thornton Hospital, San Diego; he was cremated and his ashes scattered into the Pacific Ocean. A memorial service was held at The Salk Institute, La Jolla, near San Diego, California.\n【16】 # Biology research\n【17】 Crick was interested in two fundamental unsolved problems of biology. First, how molecules make the transition from the non-living to the living, and second, how the brain makes a conscious mind. He realized that his background made him more qualified for research on the first topic and the field of biophysics. It was at this time of Crick’s transition from physics into biology that he was influenced by both Linus Pauling and Erwin Schrödinger. It was clear in theory that covalent bonds in biological molecules could provide the structural stability needed to hold genetic information in cells. It only remained as an exercise of experimental biology to discover exactly which molecule was the genetic molecule. In Crick’s view, Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, Gregor Mendel’s genetics and knowledge of the molecular basis of genetics, when combined, reveal the secret of life.\n【18】 It's clear that some macromolecule such as protein was likely to be the genetic molecule. However, it was well known that proteins are structural and functional macromolecules, some of which carry out enzymatic reactions of cells. In the 1940s, some evidence had been found pointing to another macromolecule, DNA, the other major component of chromosomes, as a candidate genetic molecule. Oswald Avery and his collaborators showed that a phenotypic difference could be caused in bacteria by providing them with a particular DNA molecule.\n【19】 However, other evidence was interpreted as suggesting that DNA was structurally uninteresting and possibly just a molecular scaffold for the apparently more interesting protein molecules. Crick was in the right place, in the right frame of mind, at the right time , to join Max Perutz’s project at Cambridge University, and he began to work on the X-ray crystallography of proteins. X-ray crystallography theoretically offered the opportunity to reveal the molecular structure of large molecules like proteins and DNA, but there were serious technical problems then preventing X-ray crystallography from being applicable to such large molecules.\n【20】 Crick taught himself the mathematical theory of X-ray crystallography. During the period of Crick's study of X-ray diffraction, researchers in the Cambridge lab were attempting to determine the most stable helical conformation of amino acid chains in proteins (the α helix). Pauling was the first to identify the 3.6 amino acids per helix turn ratio of the α helix. Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the α helix; these turned out to be important lessons that could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned the importance of the structural rigidity that double bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA.\n【21】 In 1951, together with Cochran and V. Vand, Crick assisted in the development of a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a helical molecule. This theoretical result matched well with X-ray data obtained for proteins that contain sequences of amino acids in the Alpha helix conformation (published in Nature in . Helical diffraction theory turned out to  be useful for understanding the structure of DNA.\n【22】 Late in 1951, Crick started working with James D. Watson at Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, England. Using the X-ray diffraction results of Raymond Gosling and Rosalind Franklin of King's College London, given to them by Gosling and Franklin's colleague Maurice Wilkins, Watson and Crick together developed a model for a helical structure of DNA, which they published in 1953. For this and subsequent work they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins.\n【23】 When James Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35 year old post-graduate student (due to his work during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared an interest in the fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form. Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that it might be possible to guess a good molecular model of its structure. A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Maurice Wilkins,Rosalind Franklin and their research student, Raymond Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure - but Rosalind Franklin vehemently did not. Stimulated by contact with Wilkins, and Watson attending a talk given by Rosalind Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Watson, in particular, thought they were competing against Pauling and feared that Pauling might determine the structure of DNA.\n【24】 Many have speculated about what might have happened had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May of 1952. He 'might' have been invited to see some of the Wilkins/Franklin X-ray diffraction data and such an event 'might' have led him to a double helix model (which remains (as said above) total speculation. As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the U. S. government and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis. Watson  had other work such as  trying to obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson did X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.\n【25】 Of great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules on the outside of the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she rather 'dismisivaly' pointed out to them that their first model (1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.\n【26】 Crick described what he saw as the failure of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to make a molecular model of DNA. They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both Bragg and Wilkins. In order to construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written  progress report for the King's laboratory of John Randall from late 1952.\n【27】 It is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission and before she had a chance to formally publish the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data that were included in the progress report - but Watson and Crick realised her 'staunchly' (uncompromising) held analysis (of the helical nature) was faulty - so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Perutz later published what had been in the progress report, and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created in order to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's labs were both MRC funded laboratories.\n【28】 It is  not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model building done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, William Astbury had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angstrom (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work was one of only 8 references in Franklin's first paper on DNA. Analysis of Astbury's published DNA results and the better X-ray diffraction images collected by Wilkins and Franklin revealed the helical nature of DNA. It was possible to predict the number of bases stacked within a single turn of the DNA helix (10 per turn; a full turn of the helix is 27 angstroms  in the compact A form, 34 angstroms  in the wetter B form). Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images until after the DNA double helix model was published.\n【29】 One of the few references cited by Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA, was to a published article that included Sven Furberg’s DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first \"bases in\" model to be published. Furberg's results had  provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an antiparallel orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the base pairs in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with anti-parallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that  led to these conclusions.\n【30】 As a result of leaving King's College for another institution, Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA.  When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.\n【31】 Another key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called Chargaff ratios, experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine. A visit by Erwin Chargaff to England in 1952 reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick. The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognized until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realized that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilizes the protein α helix. Watson’s recognition of the A:T and C:G pairs was aided by information from Jerry Donohue about the most likely structures of the nucleobases. After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their double helix model of DNA with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to unzip the two complementary strands for easy replication: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule. As important as Crick’s contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself.\n【32】 Crick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical than an experimental biologist. There was another close approach to discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952. Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases. He asked John Griffith to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and quantum mechanics. Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs. At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations. It did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson \"playing\" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier. The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modeling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal.\n【33】 ## Molecular biology\n【34】 In 1954, at the age of 37, Crick completed his Ph.D. thesis: \"X-Ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins\" and received his degree. Crick then worked in the laboratory of David Harker at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he continued to develop his skills in the analysis of X-ray diffraction data for proteins, working primarily on ribonuclease and the mechanisms of protein synthesis. David Harker, the American X-ray crystallographer, was described as \"the John Wayne of crystallography\" by Vittorio Luzzati, a crystallographer at the Centre for Molecular Genetics in Gif-sur-Yvette near Paris, who had worked with Rosalind Franklin.\n【35】 After the discovery of the double helix model of DNA, Crick’s interests quickly turned to the biological implications of the structure. In 1953, Watson and Crick published another article in Nature which stated: \"it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of the bases is the code that carries the genetical information\".\n【36】 In 1956, Crick and Watson speculated on the structure of small viruses.  They suggested that spherical viruses such as Tomato bushy stunt virus had icosahedral symmetry and were made from 60 identical subunits.\n【37】 After his short time in New York, Crick returned to Cambridge where he worked until 1976, at which time he moved to California. Crick engaged in several X-ray diffraction collaborations such as one with Alexander Rich on the structure of collagen. However, Crick was quickly drifting away from continued work related to his expertise in the interpretation of X-ray diffraction patterns of proteins.\n【38】 George Gamow established a group of scientists interested in the role of RNA as an intermediary between DNA as the genetic storage molecule in the nucleus of cells and the synthesis of proteins in the cytoplasm. It was clear to Crick that there had to be a code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular amino acid in a newly synthesized protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the genetic coding problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow’s RNA group. In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small adaptor molecules that would hydrogen bond to short sequences of a nucleic acid and  link to one of the amino acids. He  explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids.\n【39】 During the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesized. By 1958, Crick’s thinking had matured and he could list in an orderly way all of the key features of the protein synthesis process:\n【40】 - genetic information stored in the sequence of DNA molecules\n【41】 - a “messenger” RNA molecule to carry the instructions for making one protein to the cytoplasm\n【42】 - adaptor molecules (“they might contain nucleotides”) to match short sequences of nucleotides in the RNA messenger molecules to specific amino acids\n【43】 - ribonucleic-protein complexes that catalyse the assembly of amino acids into proteins according to the messenger RNA\n【44】 The “adaptor molecules” were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic “ribonucleic-protein complexes” became known as ribosomes. An important step was later  realization that the messenger RNA was not the same as the ribosomal RNA. None of this, however, answered the fundamental theoretical question of the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Such a code might be “degenerate”, with 4x4x4=64 possible triplets of the four nucleotide subunits while there were only 20 amino acids. Some amino acids might have multiple triplet codes. Crick  explored other codes in which for various reasons only some of the triplets were used, “magically” producing just the 20 needed combinations. Experimental results were needed; theory alone could not decide the nature of the code. Crick  used the term “central dogma” to summarize an idea that implies that genetic  information flow between macromolecules  would be essentially one-way:\n【45】 DNA → RNA → Protein\n【46】 Some critics thought that by using the word \"dogma\" Crick was implying that this was a rule that could not be questioned, but all he really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a dominant, if not the dominant, theoretical molecular biologist.\n【47】 Proof that the genetic code is a degenerate triplet code finally came from genetics experiments, some of which were performed by Crick. The details of the code came mostly from work by Marshall Nirenberg and others who synthesized synthetic RNA molecules and used them as templates for in vitro protein synthesis.\n【48】 # Controversy about using King's College London's results\n【49】 An enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling. The controversy arose from the fact that some of the data were shown to them, without her knowledge, by her boss, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz. Her experimental results provided estimates of water content of DNA crystals and these results were most consistent with the three sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin personally told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside, whilst vehemently stating (erroneously) that is exhibited a helical structure. Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the DNA strands were antiparallel, which helped Watson and Crick decide to look for DNA models with two polynucleotide strands. The X-ray diffraction images collected by Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA - but she failed to recognise this fact. However Franklin's experimental work proved important in Crick and Watson's development of the correct model.\n【50】 Prior to publication of the double helix structure, Watson and Crick had little interaction with Franklin. Crick and Watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with Maurice Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer and was in part responsible for the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at King's College. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. Brenda Maddox suggested that because of the importance of her experimental results used Watson and Crick's model building and theoretical analysis, Franklin should have had her name on the original Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Watson and Crick offered joint authorship to Wilkins which he turned down at the time, but which he may have subsequently regretted. (Franklin and Ray Gosling submitted their own joint 'second' paper to Nature at the same time as Wilkins, Stokes and Wilson submitted theirs, i.e., the 'third' paper on DNA.).\n【51】 # Views on religion\n【52】 Crick once joked, \"Christianity may be OK between consenting adults in private but should not be taught to young children.\"\n【53】 In his book Of Molecules and Men, Crick expressed his views on the relationship between science and religion. After suggesting that it would become possible for people to wonder if a computer might be programmed so as to have a soul, he wondered: at what point during biological evolution did the first organism have a soul? At what moment does a baby get a soul? Crick stated his view that the idea of a non-material soul that could enter a body and then persist after death is just that, an imagined idea. For Crick, the mind is a product of physical brain activity and the brain had evolved by natural means over millions of years. Crick felt that it was important that evolution by natural selection be taught in public schools and that it was regrettable that English schools had compulsory religious instruction. Crick felt that a new scientific world view was rapidly being established, and predicted that once the detailed workings of the brain were eventually revealed, erroneous Christian concepts about the nature of man and the world would no longer be tenable; traditional conceptions of the \"soul\" would be replaced by a new understanding of the physical basis of mind. He was skeptical of organized religion, referring to himself as a skeptic and an agnostic with \"a strong inclination towards atheism\".\n【54】 In 1960, Crick accepted a fellowship at Churchill College Cambridge, one factor being that the new college did not have a chapel. Sometime later a large donation was made to establish a chapel and the fellowship elected to accept it. Crick resigned his fellowship in protest.\n【55】 In October 1969, Crick participated in a celebration of the 100th year of the journal Nature. Crick attempted to make some predictions about what the next 30 years would hold for molecular biology. His speculations were later published in Nature.  Near the end of the article, Crick briefly mentioned the search for life on other planets, but he held little hope that extraterrestrial life would be found by the year 2000. He  discussed what he described as a possible new direction for research, what he called \"biochemical theology\". Crick wrote, \"So many people pray that one finds it hard to believe that they do not get some satisfaction from it.\"\n【56】 Crick suggested that it might be possible to find chemical changes in the brain that were molecular correlates of the act of prayer. He speculated that there might be a detectable change in the level of some neurotransmitter or neurohormone when people pray. Crick may have been imagining substances such as dopamine that are released by the brain under certain conditions and produce rewarding sensations. Crick's suggestion that there might some day be a new science of \"biochemical theology\" seems to have been realized under an alternative name: there is now the new field of Neurotheology. Crick's view of the relationship between science and religion continued to play a role in his work as he made the transition from molecular biology research into theoretical neuroscience.\n【57】 # Directed panspermia\n【58】 During the 1960s, Crick became concerned with the origins of the genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of Leslie Orgel at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the origin of life. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing organisms.  At that time, everyone thought of proteins as the only kind of enzymes and ribozymes had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting Earth. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called “Directed Panspermia”. In a retrospective article, Crick and Orgel noted that they had been overly pessimistic about the chances of abiogenesis on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life.\n【59】 # Neuroscience, other interests\n【60】 Crick's period at Cambridge was the pinnacle of his long scientific career, but he left Cambridge in 1977 after 30 years, having been offered (and having refused) the Mastership of Gonville & Caius. James Watson claimed at a Cambridge conference marking the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA in 2003: \"Now perhaps it's a pretty well kept secret that one of the most uninspiring acts of Cambridge University over this past century was to turn down Francis Crick when he applied to be the Professor of Genetics, in 1958. Now there may have been a series of arguments, which lead them to reject Francis.  It was really saying, don't push us to the frontier.\"  The apparently \"pretty well kept secret\" had already been recorded in Soraya De Chadarevian's \"Designs For Life: Molecular Biology After World War II\", published by CUP in 2002. His major contribution to molecular biology in Cambridge is well documented in The History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 4 (1870 to , which was published by Cambridge University Press in 1992.\n【61】 According to the University of Cambridge's genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University Vice-Chancellor Lord Adrian. Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, Guido Pontecorvo, who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who  refused.\n【62】 In 1976, Crick took a sabbatical year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. Crick had been a nonresident fellow of the Institute since 1960. Crick wrote, \"I felt at home in Southern California.\" After the sabbatical, Crick left Cambridge in order to continue working at the Salk Institute. He was  a professor at the University of California, San Diego. He taught himself neuroanatomy and studied many other areas of neuroscience research. It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of alternative splicing and the discovery of restriction enzymes, which helped make possible genetic engineering. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, consciousness. His autobiographical book, What Mad Pursuit, includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience.\n【63】 Upon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:\n【64】 - there were many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience with little contact between them\n【65】 - many people who were interested in behaviour treated the brain as a black box\n【66】 - consciousness was viewed as a taboo subject by many neurobiologists\n【67】 Crick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland. Crick established a collaboration with Christof Koch that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990 to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term memory processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick  published a book describing how neurobiology had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book The Astonishing Hypothesis made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences. Crick was skeptical about the value of computational models of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.\n【68】 Crick was elected a fellow of CSICOP in 1983 and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism in the same year. In 1995, Francis Crick was one of the original endorsers of the Ashley Montagu Resolution to petition for an end to the genital mutilation of children.\n【69】 # Reactions to Crick and his work\n【70】 Crick has widely been described as talkative, brash, and lacking modesty. His personality combined with his scientific accomplishments produced many opportunities for Crick to stimulate reactions from others, both inside and outside of the scientific world, which was the centre of his intellectual and professional life. Crick spoke rapidly, and rather loudly, and had an infectious and reverberating laugh, and a lively sense of humour. One colleague from the Salk Institute described him as \"a brainstorming intellectual powerhouse with a mischievous smile\" Francis was never mean-spirited, just incisive. He detected microscopic flaws in logic. In a room full of smart scientists, Francis continually reearned his position as the heavyweight champ.\"\n【71】 ## Religious beliefs\n【72】 The conservative political analyst Mark Steyn published an obituary of Crick and attempted a deconstruction of Crick's scientific motivations. Steyn characterized Crick as a militant atheist and asserted that it was his atheism that \"drove\" Crick to move beyond conventional molecular biology towards speculative topics such as panspermia. Steyn described the theory of directed panspermia as amounting to, \"gods in the skies who fertilize the earth and then retreat to the heavens beyond our reach.\" Steyn categorized Crick’s ideas on directed panspermia as a result of \"hyper-rationalism\" that, \"lead him round to embracing a belief in a celestial creator of human life, indeed a deus ex machina.\"\n【73】 Steyn's critique of Crick ignored the fact that Crick never held a belief in panspermia. Crick explored the hypothesis that it might be possible for life forms to be moved from one planet to another. What \"drove\" Crick towards speculation about directed panspermia was the difficulty of imagining how a complex system like a cell could arise under pre-biotic conditions from non-living chemical components. After ribozymes were discovered, Crick became much less interested in panspermia because it was then much easier to imagine the pre-biotic origins of life as being made possible by some set of simple self-replicating polymers.\n【74】 ## Eugenics\n【75】 Crick occasionally expressed his views on eugenics, usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children. He once remarked, \"In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin to worry about the character of the next generation It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200 years, society did not come round to the view that they would have to try to improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another.\" Some observers have labeled Crick's views on eugenics as \"controversial\"\n【76】 ## Creationism\n【77】 It has been suggested by some observers that Crick's speculation about panspermia, \"fits neatly into the intelligent design concept.\" Crick's name was raised in this context in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial over the teaching of intelligent design. However, Crick wrote:\n【78】 \"The age of the earth is now established beyond any reasonable doubt as very great, yet in the United States millions of Fundamentalists still stoutly defend the naive view that it is relatively short, an opinion deduced from reading the Christian Bible too literally. They  usually deny that animals and plants have evolved and changed radically over such long periods, although this is equally well established. This gives one little confidence that what they have to say about the process of natural selection is likely to be unbiased, since their views are predetermined by a slavish adherence to religious dogmas.\"\n【79】 In the 1987 United States Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard, Crick joined a group of other Nobel laureates who advised that, \"'Creation-science' simply has no place in the public-school science classroom.\" Crick was  an advocate for the establishment of Darwin Day as a British national holiday.\n【80】 # Recognition\n【81】 The Francis Crick Prize Lectures at The Royal Society, London\n【82】 The Francis Crick Prize Lecture was established in 2003 following an endowment by his former colleague, Sydney Brenner, joint winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. The lecture is delivered annually in any field of biological sciences, with preference given to the areas in which Francis Crick himself worked. Importantly, the lectureship is aimed at younger scientists, ideally under 40, or whose career progression corresponds to this age.\n【83】 The Francis Crick Graduate Lectures at the University of Cambridge\n【84】 The University of Cambridge Graduate School of Biological, Medical and Veterinary Sciences hosts The Francis Crick Graduate Lectures. The first two lectures were by John Gurdon and Tim Hunt.\n【85】 \"For my generation, Francis Crick was probably the most obviously influential presence. He was often at lunch in the canteen of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology where he liked to explain what he was thinking about, and he was always careful to make sure that everyone round the table really understood. He was a frequent presence at talks in and around Cambridge, where he liked to ask questions. Sometimes, I remember thinking, they seemed slightly ignorant questions to which a man of his extraordinary range and ability ought to have known the answers. Only slowly did it dawn on me that he only and always asked questions when he was unclear or unsure, a great lesson.\" (Tim Hunt, first Francis Crick Graduate Lecturer: June\n【86】 The wording on the new DNA sculpture (which was donated by James Watson) outside Clare College's Thirkill Court, Cambridge, England is\n【87】 a) on the base:\n【88】 i) \"These strands unravel during cell reproduction. Genes are encoded in the sequence of bases.\"\n【89】 ii) \"The double helix model was supported by the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.\"\n【90】 b) on the helices:\n【91】 i) \"The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson while Watson lived here at Clare.\"\n【92】 ii) \"The molecule of DNA has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs Adenine - Thymine or Guanine - Cytosine.\"\n【93】 The aluminium sculpture stands fifteen feet high. It took a pair of technicians a fortnight to build it. For the artist responsible it was an opportunity to create a monument that brings together the themes of science and nature; Charles Jencks, Sculptor said \"It embraces the trees, you can sit on it and the ground grows up and it twists out of the ground. So it's truly interacting with living things like the turf, and that idea was behind it and I think it does celebrate life and DNA.\" Tony Badger, Master of Clare, said: \"It is wonderful to have this lasting reminder of his achievements while he- was at Clare and the enormous contribution he- and Francis Crick have made to our understanding of life on earth.\" - James Watson.\n【94】 - Fellow of the Royal Society\n【95】 - Fellow International Academy of Humanism\n【96】 - Fellow CSICOP\n【97】 -  Westminster City Council unveiled a green plaque to Francis Crick on the front façade of 56 St George's Square, Pimlico, London SW1 on the 20th June 2007; Crick lived in the first floor flat, together with Robert Dougall of BBC radio and later TV fame, a former Royal Navy associate.\n【98】 # Books by Francis Crick\n【99】 \n【100】 - What Mad Pursu\n【101】 - Kreiseliana: about and around Georg Kreisel; ISBN 1-56881-061-X; 495 pages.

The method can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, and introduce point mutations. Gene targeting can be permanent or conditional. Conditions can be a specific time during development / life of the organism or limitation to a specific tissue, for example. Gene targeting requires the creation of a specific vector for each gene of interest. However, it can be used for any gene, regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size.\n【2】 # Method\n【3】 Gene targeting methods vary depending on organism. To target genes in mice a rough outline of the necessary steps is as follows: First, a targeting construct made out of DNA is generated in bacteria. It typically contains part of the gene to be targeted, a reporter gene, and a selectable marker. This construct is then inserted into mouse embryonic stem cells in culture. After cells with the correct insertion have been selected, they can be used to contribute to a mouse's tissue via embryo injection. Finally, chimeric mice where the modified cells made up the reproductive organs are selected for via breeding. After this step the entire body of the mouse is based on the previously selected embryonic stem cell.\n【4】 # Comparison with gene trapping\n【5】 Gene trapping is based on random insertion of a 80's cassette while gene targeting targets a specific gene. 80's cassettes can be used for many different things while the flanking homology regions of gene targeting cassettes need to be adapted for each gene. This makes gene trapping more easily amenable for large scale projects than targeting. On the other hand, gene targeting can be used for genes with low transcriptions that would go undetected in a trap screen.  Also, the probability of trapping increases with intron size. For gene targeting these compact genes are just as easily altered.\n【6】 # 2007 Nobel prize\n【7】 Mario R. Capecchi, Martin J.

Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration with Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation.\n【29】 - The management of patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma requires therapeutic interventions in addition to ocular hypotensive agents. Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n【30】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Because Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended in such patients.\n【31】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients.\n【32】 - In clinical studies, local ocular adverse effects, primarily conjunctivitis and lid reactions, were reported with chronic administration of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution. Many of these reactions had the clinical appearance and course of an allergic-type reaction that resolved upon discontinuation of drug therapy. If such reactions are observed, Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution should be discontinued and the patient evaluated before considering restarting the drug.\n【33】 - There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution. The concomitant administration of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended.\n【34】 - There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Choroidal detachment has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., dorzolamide) after filtration procedures.\n【35】 - There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Precautions should be used when prescribing Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution to this group of patients.\n【36】 # Adverse Reactions\n【37】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【38】 - The most frequent adverse events associated with Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution were ocular burning, stinging, or discomfort immediately following ocular administration (approximately one-third of patients). Approximately one-quarter of patients noted a bitter taste following administration. Superficial punctate keratitis occurred in 10-15% of patients and signs and symptoms of ocular allergic reaction in approximately 10%. Events occurring in approximately 1-5% of patients were conjunctivitis and lid reactions, blurred vision, eye redness, tearing, dryness, and photophobia.\n【39】 - Other ocular events and systemic events were reported infrequently, including headache, nausea, asthenia/fatigue; and, rarely, skin rashes, urolithiasis, and iridocyclitis.\n【40】 - In a 3-month, double-masked, active-treatment-controlled, multicenter study in pediatric patients, the adverse experience profile of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution was comparable to that seen in adult patients.\n【41】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【42】 - The following adverse events have occurred either at low incidence (<1%) during clinical trials or have been reported during the use of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution in clinical practice where these events were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size and frequency of occurrence cannot be determined precisely. They have been chosen for inclusion based on factors such as seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution, or a combination of these factors: signs and symptoms of systemic allergic reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, pruritus, and urticaria; Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; dizziness, paresthesia; ocular pain, transient myopia, choroidal detachment following filtration surgery, eyelid crusting; dyspnea; contact dermatitis, epistaxis, dry mouth and throat irritation.\n【43】 # Drug Interactions\n【44】 - Salicylate\n【45】 - Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution.\n【46】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【47】 ### Pregnancy\n【48】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【49】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【50】 - Developmental toxicity studies with dorzolamide hydrochloride in rabbits at oral doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day (31 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed malformations of the vertebral bodies. These malformations occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased fetal weights. No treatment-related malformations were seen at 1.0 mg/kg/day (13 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n【51】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【52】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category B3\n【53】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Dorzolamide in women who are pregnant.\n【54】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【55】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Dorzolamide during labor and delivery.\n【56】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【57】 - In a study of dorzolamide hydrochloride in lactating rats, decreases in body weight gain of 5 to 7% in offspring at an oral dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day (94 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) were seen during lactation. A slight delay in postnatal development (incisor eruption, vaginal canalization and eye openings), secondary to lower fetal body weight, was noted.\n【58】 - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【59】 ### Pediatric Use\n【60】 - Safety and IOP-lowering effects of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution have been demonstrated in pediatric patients in a 3-month, multicenter, double-masked, active-treatment-controlled trial.\n【61】 ### Geriatic Use\n【62】 - No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.\n【63】 ### Gender\n【64】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Dorzolamide with respect to specific gender populations.\n【65】 ### Race\n【66】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Dorzolamide with respect to specific racial populations.\n【67】 ### Renal Impairment\n【68】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Dorzolamide in patients with renal impairment.\n【69】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【70】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Dorzolamide in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【71】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【72】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Dorzolamide in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【73】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【74】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Dorzolamide in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【75】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【76】 ### Administration\n【77】 Ophthalmic\n【78】 ### Monitoring\n【79】 Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored.\n【80】 # IV Compatibility\n【81】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Dorzolamide in the drug label.\n【82】 # Overdosage\n【83】 ## Acute Overdose\n【84】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n【85】 Electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, and possible central nervous system effects may occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored.\n【86】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【87】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Dorzolamide in the drug label.\n【88】 # Pharmacology\n【89】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【90】 - Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs), but  in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP).\n【91】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution contains dorzolamide hydrochloride, an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Following topical ocular administration, Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution reduces elevated intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss.\n【92】 ## Structure\n【93】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor formulated for topical ophthalmic use.\n【94】 - Dorzolamide hydrochloride USP is described chemically as: (4S-trans)-4-(ethylamino)-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-thienothiopyran-2-sulfonamide 7,7-dioxide monohydrochloride. Dorzolamide hydrochloride USP is optically active. Its empirical formula is C10H16N2O4S3HCl and its structural formula is:\n【95】 - Dorzolamide hydrochloride USP has a molecular weight of 360.9 and a melting point of about 264°C. It is a white to off-white, crystalline powder, which is soluble in water and slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol.\n【96】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered, slightly viscous, aqueous solution of dorzolamide hydrochloride USP. The pH of the solution is approximately 5.6, and the osmolarity is 260-330 mOsM. Each mL of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution 2% contains 20 mg dorzolamide (22.3 mg of dorzolamide hydrochloride USP).\n【97】 - Inactive ingredients are hydroxyethyl cellulose, mannitol, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH) and water for injection. Benzalkonium chloride 0.0075% is added as a preservative.\n【98】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【99】 - When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured.\n【100】 - Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but  inhibits CA-I. The metabolite  accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM).\n【101】 - Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite  is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months.\n【102】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【103】 - To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg b.i.d. closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution 2% t.i.d. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks.\n【104】 - The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anhydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.\n【105】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【106】 - In a two-year study of dorzolamide hydrochloride administered orally to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, urinary bladder papillomas were seen in male rats in the highest dosage group of 20 mg/kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). Papillomas were not seen in rats given oral doses equivalent to approximately 12 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose. No treatment-related tumors were seen in a 21-month study in female and male mice given oral doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (~900 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose).\n【107】 - The increased incidence of urinary bladder papillomas seen in the high-dose male rats is a class effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in rats. Rats are particularly prone to developing papillomas in response to foreign bodies, compounds causing crystalluria, and diverse sodium salts.\n【108】 - No changes in bladder urothelium were seen in dogs given oral dorzolamide hydrochloride for one year at 2 mg/kg/day (25 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) or monkeys dosed topically to the eye at 0.4 mg/kg/day (~5 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) for one year.\n【109】 - The following tests for mutagenic potential were negative:  in vivo (mouse) cytogenetic assay;  in vitro chromosomal aberration assay;  alkaline elution assay;  V-79 assay; and  Ames test.\n【110】 - In reproduction studies of dorzolamide hydrochloride in rats, there were no adverse effects on the reproductive capacity of males or females at doses up to 188 or 94 times, respectively, the recommended human ophthalmic dose.\n【111】 # Clinical Studies\n【112】 - The efficacy of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution was demonstrated in clinical studies in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension (baseline IOP ≥ 23 mmHg). The IOP-lowering effect of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution was approximately 3 to 5 mmHg throughout the day and this was consistent in clinical studies of up to one year duration.\n【113】 - The efficacy of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution when dosed less frequently than three times a day (alone or in combination with other products) has not been established.\n【114】 - In a one year clinical study, the effect of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution 2% t.i.d. on the corneal endothelium was compared to that of betaxolol ophthalmic solution b.i.d. and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% b.i.d. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in corneal endothelial cell counts or in corneal thickness measurements. There was a mean loss of approximately 4% in the endothelial cell counts for each group over the one year period.\n【115】 # How Supplied\n【116】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is a slightly opalescent, nearly colorless, slightly viscous solution.\n【117】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is supplied in a white low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bottle with a controlled drop tip and orange polypropylene cap in the following sizes:\n【118】 - Store Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F). Protect from light.\n【119】 ## Storage\n【120】 There is limited information regarding Dorzolamide Storage in the drug label.\n【121】 # Images\n【122】 ## Drug Images\n【123】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【124】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【125】 - Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution is a sulfonamide and although administered topically is absorbed systemically. Therefore the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration. Patients should be advised that if serious or unusual reactions including severe skin reactions or signs of hypersensitivity occur, they should discontinue the use of the product.\n【126】 - Patients should be advised that if they develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and lid reactions, they should discontinue use and seek their physician's advice.\n【127】 - Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures.\n【128】 - Patients should  be instructed that ocular solutions, if handled improperly or if the tip of the dispensing container contacts the eye or surrounding structures, can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.\n【129】 - Patients  should be advised that if they have ocular surgery or develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection), they should immediately seek their physician's advice concerning the continued use of the present multidose container.\n【130】 - If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least ten minutes apart.\n【131】 - Patients should be advised that Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution contains benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to administration of the solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution administration.\n【132】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【133】 Alcohol-Dorzolamide interaction has not been established. Talk to your doctor about the effects of taking alcohol with this medication.\n【134】 # Brand Names\n【135】 Trusopt Ocumeter\n【136】 # Look-Alike Drug Names\n【137】 N/A\n【138】 # Drug Shortage Status\n", "seq_id": 26871, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#1#2#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#9#12#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#19#23#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#53#55#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#63#77#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#80#81#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#119#123#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#132#138#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 22:02:53"}

The devastation wrought in two European capitals, Madrid and London, demonstrate the impact that can be achieved by detonating explosives among densely packed civilians. In an instant, an explosion can wreak havoc-producing numerous casualties with complex, technically challenging injuries not commonly seen after natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, or hurricanes. Because many patients self-evacuate after a terrorist attack, and prehospital care may be difficult to coordinate, hospitals near the scene can expect to receive a large influx-or surge-of victims after a terrorist strike. This rapid surge of victims typically occurs within minutes, exemplified by the Madrid bombings where the closest hospital received 272 patients in 2.5 hours. Such a surge differs dramatically from the gradual influx of patients after an outbreak of infectious disease or an environmental emergency such as a heat wave, which can last several days to weeks afterwards. In addition, injuries to workers involved in recovery procedures can lead to a secondary wave in surge. The key question is this: Can hospitals meet the challenge? Health care and public health specialists anticipate profound problems in adequately caring for the resulting surge of victims. Our current health care system, especially the emergency care system, is already severely strained by its routine volume of daily care. Further, the health care system, emergency departments, and intensive care units (ICUs) of acute care hospitals are chronically overcrowded and resource-constrained. Without immediate federal assistance, many, if not most, communities would have difficulty caring for a surge of victims because each hospital and emergency medical service differs dramatically in capacity, training, and level of coordination. Indeed, a terrorist bombing in the United States would be a \"predictable surprise.\" To address the challenges posed by such an event, CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (CDC's Injury Center) convened an expert panel in October 2005 and January 2006. The panel included experts in the areas of emergency medical services, emergency medicine, trauma surgery, burn surgery, pediatrics, otolaryngology, intensive care medicine, hospital medicine, radiology, pharmacology, nursing, hospital administration, laboratory medicine (blood bank), and public health. The panel was charged with identifying creative strategies that could be adopted in a timely manner to address surge issues from terrorism. The panel focused on recommending strategies for rapid management of large numbers of bombing casualties. They examined the related challenges that would confront not only the general emergency medical response and health care system, but would  affect select medical disciplines. Though developed in the context of a surge of injuries from a terrorist bombing, the recommendations in this report may improve the response to and management of a surge of patients from any cause, including biological, chemical, or nuclear. This document, which is the result of the expert panel meetings, reflects the opinions and recommendations of the experts. It includes a description of system-wide and discipline-#\n【1】 specific challenges as well as recommended solutions to address these challenges. The proposed solutions for the discipline-specific challenges have been incorporated into easy to use templates that can assist various disciplines in managing surge needs for injuries. The needs and resources of each community must be considered to effectively plan for a surge of patients into an already overburdened health care system. Admittedly, community resources are not specific to handling casualties of explosives, but the likelihood of this threat and the sudden demand it would place on the health care system make it imperative to manage deficiencies in surge capacity now-not when crisis strikes-and to do so in an aggressive, but thoughtful manner.\n【2】 # Background\n【3】 Current patterns in terrorist activity increase the potential for civilian casualties from explosions. Recent events in Egypt, India, Iraq, Israel, Spain, and the United Kingdom clearly indicate that bombings targeting civilian populations are an ever-present danger worldwide. The U.S. Department of State reported 7,000 terrorist bombings worldwide between 1968 and 1999. 1 From 2001 through 200, more than 500 international terrorist bombings caused more than 4,600 deaths, 1-excluding the attacks of September 11, 2001, which essentially used planes as flying bombs.\n【4】 The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed 24 incidents of terrorist bombings in the United States between 1980 and 2001. 4 More than 21,000 bombing incidents (actual, accidental, attempted) occurred in the U. S. between 1988 and 1998. 5 In 2005 alone, according to reports compiled from the Terrorist Attack Archives, Terrorism Research Center, 758 terrorist events were staged in 45 countries, and more than half (N =  were bombings. These events resulted in 8,019 injured persons and ,049 deaths. 6 Despite justifiable concerns about the dangers of chemical, biologic, or nuclear attacks, bombings with conventional explosives remain the terrorists' method of choice. Explosions, particularly in confined spaces, can inflict multi-system injuries on numerous patients and produce unique management challenges to health providers. Unlike the gradual influx of patients after events such as infectious diseases, the surge of patients after an explosion typically occurs within minutes of the event and overwhelms nearby hospital resources. 7,8 The potential for large numbers of casualties and an immediate surge of patients may stress and limit the ability of emergency medical services (EMS) systems, hospitals, and other health care facilities to care for the onslaught of critically injured victims.  The ongoing and increasing threat of terrorist activities, combined with documented evidence of decreasing emergency care capacity, requires preemptive action. Health care and public health systems, individual hospitals and health care personnel must collaborate to ensure that strategies are in place to effectively receive, evaluate, and treat large numbers of injured patients; to rapidly identify and stabilize the most critically injured; to evaluate these efforts; and to strategically plan for future incidents.\n【5】 The Role of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (CDC's Injury Center) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n【6】 The mission of CDC's Injury Center, is to prevent premature death and disability and to reduce the human suffering and medical cost caused by injuries. This mission supports CDC's strategic goal to protect people in all communities from terrorist threats. As a means to prevent injuries and minimize the consequences of injury, the Injury Center uses the public health approach-a systematic process to define the injury problem, identify risk and protective factors, develop and test prevention interventions and strategies, and ensure widespread adoption of effective interventions and strategies.\n【7】 Many agencies have addressed issues of surge capacity for events such as biological attacks-most notably, CDC's public health and laboratory surge programs and the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) hospital preparedness program. To date, little effort has been directed toward increasing surge capacity in response to terrorist bombings. After in-depth discussions with HRSA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and CDC's Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, the Injury Center learned that CDC could play a unique role in identifying surge capacity issues related to terrorist bombings and proposing solutions. Furthermore, any solutions to enhance surge capacity in preparation for terrorist bombings directly apply to surge issues for other manmade or natural disasters.\n【8】 To this end, CDC's Injury Center convened an expert panel in October 2005 and January 2006. The expert panel was charged with identifying creative strategies that could be adopted in a timely manner to address surge issues from terrorism; in essence, identifying both system-wide and discipline-specific concerns and recommending feasible and affordable strategies for rapidly managing large numbers of bombing casualties. This document is the result of those meetings, reflects the opinions and recommendations of this expert panel, and includes its recommendations. These recommendations were designed for emergency medical, health care, and public health systems, with the caveat that immediate steps be taken to ensure an effective response. To kick off the process, the expert panel set objectives:\n【9】 - Increase collaboration between CDC and federal agencies, external partners, and other experts on issues of surge capacity for injuries from conventional weapons. - Identify factors that limit rapid assessment and treatment of injured patients in the field and at hospitals (including triage, availability of radiology, and access to operating theatres) and develop mechanisms to address these factors; and - Develop a strategy and identify mechanisms to widely disseminate and implement findings from the expert panel (e.g., Web, print publications, and training curricula).\n【10】 The panel represented a broad spectrum of medical care and administrative disciplines required to care for victims of a bombing. Panel members included personnel from emergency medical services; physicians specializing in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, burn surgery, pediatrics, otolaryngology, intensive care medicine, hospital medicine, and radiology; experts in pharmacology, nursing, hospital administration, and blood banking; and experts in public health. Expert panel members are listed in the acknowledgements section of this report.\n【11】 # The Evolution of Terrorism\n【12】 At the heart of, and as an impetus for, this meeting is the fact that terrorist attacks remain an ever-present threat. Terrorist events continue to occur globally and on an alarming scale. Bombings-the perpetrators' method of choice-remain a real and constant threat, averaging two terrorist attacks per day worldwide in 2005. 6 In the past thirty years, terrorism has evolved from mostly secular, nationalist movements to diverse, multinational, global organizations. 12 These organizations have different motivations and tactics, and their bombings are increasingly lethal, 1 as witnessed in Madrid (March , London (July , and Mumbai (July , terrorist efforts reveal an ever-increasing degree of sophistication, coordination, and capacity for harm.\n【13】 # Lessons Learned in Madrid\n【14】 In an effort to provide a framework to the meetings and subsequent discussions, the panel was presented with the example of the March 2004 Madrid bombings at the beginning of the first meeting. The Madrid experience provides a real-life scenario of what U.S. health care providers and systems must be prepared to confront: a complex, coordinated attack with thousands injured and a rapid surge of patients into surrounding hospitals. On March 11, 2004, between 079 and 0742 hours, ten terrorist bombs detonated on four crowded commuter trains, killing 177 people instantly and injuring more than 2,000. Three hundred and twelve patients were evaluated and treated at Gregario Maranon University General Hospital (GMUGH), 272 of them arriving between 0759 and 100 hours. The Madrid response entailed multiple logistical and operational challenges, including field triage and transportation of injured persons; inpatient discharge; evacuation of emergency departments (EDs) and intensive care units (ICUs), and multiple surgical procedures and tests (hundreds of radiographs, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasounds). By 2100 hours that same day, 1,40 casualties had been treated at multiple hospitals; of these, 966 had been transported to 15 public community hospitals. 14 Panel members were asked to describe how their discipline would respond to the Madrid example.\n【15】 Terrorist Bombings in the United States: A \"Predictable Surprise\"\n【16】 The reality of persistent, complex, global terrorist bombings, such as Madrid, make terrorist bombings in the U. S. a \"predictable surprise.\" The expert panel reviewed the characteristics of \"predictable surprises\" listed below early in the course of the meeting process, to provide background on common problems that could hinder effective surge response, and in an effort to identify concerns and issues that needed to be addressed within their recommendations.\n【17】 The following characteristics of \"predictable surprises\" outlined by Bazerman and Watkins 15 apply to terrorist bombings and the U. S.:\n【18】 # A shared trait of predictable surprises is that leaders knew a problem existed and that the problem would not solve itself.\n【19】 Reports of bombings occur almost daily. When-not if-terrorism returns to the U. S., our EMS and hospital systems will be ill-equipped to manage the consequences.\n【20】 # Predictable surprises can be expected when organizational members recognize that a problem is getting worse over time.\n【21】 Terrorist events show no signs of abating. Between 2001 and 200, more than 500 international terrorist bombings resulted in more than 4,600 deaths, as reported by the U.S. Department of State. 1-In 2005 alone, 758 worldwide terrorist events occurred, of which 99 were bombings. These events occurred in 45 countries and resulted in 8,019 persons injured and ,049 deaths. 6\n【22】 # Fixing the problem would incur significant costs in the present, while the benefits of action would be delayed and ambiguous.\n【23】 A central issue in preparing for terrorist bombings in the U.S. is to proactively educate health care providers in the clinical management of bombing injuries. Education is expensive. Even if health care providers are initially trained to care for bombing-related injuries, unless these terrorist events become a more frequent and unfortunate reality, education must be repeated regularly to assure currency of knowledge and clinical competency. Another issue concerns the rapid push of clinical information immediately after an event. The mechanisms and capability to do this need to be developed and may be costly. Finally, many EMS systems and hospitals do not have capacity to care for patients beyond their usual volume; and some do not have capacity to care for the volume they now have, as evidenced by frequent ambulance diversions and lengthy delays for ambulances to offload patients at hospital EDs. The cost of increasing facility capacity in the EMS and hospital systems may be substantial. Although increasing capacity will have immediate impact on daily operations in EMS and hospitals, the benefits of education and better systems for disseminating information will not be fully recognized until used in response to a terrorist attack or other disaster.\n【24】 # Decision makers often fail to prepare for predictable surprises because the natural human tendency is to maintain the status quo.\n【25】 Outside the military, our country's health care providers have little experience with terrorist bombings-particularly those capable of producing many potentially survivable injuries. Injury is the leading cause of death in the United States for persons between the ages of 1 and 44; 16 thus, many civilian health care providers, especially those in trauma systems, have vast experience in injury care, including incidents with multiple casualties. However, we have learned from the experiences of our military and international colleagues that clinical management of casualties from terrorist bombings differs considerably from that seen daily in trauma centers (e.g., blunt and penetrating trauma). To assume we can provide the same level of care for large numbers of victims from terrorist bombings as we do for victims of a bus crash is self-deceiving-a natural reaction is to maintain the status quo. Relying on traditional disaster management and trauma life support training is far easier and less expensive than learning and practicing new skills.\n【26】 # A small vocal minority benefits from inaction, and is motivated to subvert the actions of leaders for their personal benefit.\n【27】 No matter what the motivation, some people benefit from inaction.\n【28】 # Leaders can expect little credit for the prevention of predictable surprises.\n【29】 Advocating for and acquiring resources for terrorist bombing preparedness and response is challenging-especially when so many competing preparedness and response needs must  be met. With limited resources and the need for near-term results, leaders who prepare for events that may not occur can expect little credit for being proactive.\n【30】 # Surge Capacity Challenges\n【31】 # System-wide Challenges\n【32】 The threat of terrorism exists at a time when our hospitals and EDs are struggling to care for the patients who present during routine operations each day. Hospitals and emergency health care systems are stressed and face enormous challenges. Ambulances are routinely diverted from one facility to another. According to a 200 report from the National Center for Health Statistics, 4% of U.S. EDs diverted ambulances from primary destinations; diversions occurred more frequently in metropolitan areas (50% of metro hospitals). 16 Emergency departments routinely operate above capacity. Sometimes, paramedics are forced to wait for extended periods before their patients can be transferred to hospital staff. Patients are evaluated and treated in ED hallways and held for hours, or even days, awaiting placement in an inpatient bed as hospitals struggle with high occupancy. In 200, there were 11.9 million visits to EDs in the U. S., representing a 26% increase from 199's 90. million visits. During this same period, the number of U.S. EDs decreased 14%. 17 The problem became worse in the 1990s when our nation lost 10,000 staffed inpatient medical surgical beds and 7,800 ICU beds. 18 Reductions in hospitals with EDs, regionalization of surgical care, increases in non-emergency patient visits to EDs, diversion of EMS, and personnel shortages have led to unprecedented crowding in EDs.  The Institute of Medicine recently released a three-part report highlighting the challenges facing our nation's emergency care system.  This is the context in which we confront the growing threat of international terrorism. Hospitals are wholly unequipped to handle a sudden surge of highly complex injuries.\n【33】 If a large-scale event (manmade or natural) occurs, health care systems and hospitals must be able to treat an immediate and potentially large influx of patients. A recent CDC publication determined that about three fourths of hospitals had disaster plans that addressed explosives, but few (one fifth) had actually conducted a drill involving imagined use of explosives. 27 Issues affect the spectrum of injury care from prehospital through rehabilitation and  affect personnel from fire chiefs, trauma surgeons, and nursing supervisors to emergency medical technicians. Many problematic areas stand between the current reality of emergency care in the United States and the effective management of a Madrid-like event:\n【34】 # Organization and Leadership\n【35】 Effective preparedness and response demand an established, functional leadership structure with clear organizational responsibilities. In many instances, particularly at a local operational level, such preparation has not occurred. Consequently, confusion over who has responsibility for specific actions will occur, increasing the potential for redundant efforts or gaps in decision-making.\n【36】 # Alterations in Standards of Care\n【37】 Altering the standards of medical care provided in order to do the greatest good for the community is a concept and practice that is fraught with ethical, societal, and legal issues, making it difficult to surmount.\n【38】 # Education\n【39】 Disaster preparedness and response education is not included in most medical or nursing school curricula; and, with the exception of emergency medicine, preparedness and response is not a requirement in residency training programs. Thus, most health care providers are not prepared to handle clinical care during a disaster. As standard curriculum, emergency medical technician (EMT) paramedics are required to complete a module on \"medical incident command.\" Yet EMT Intermediates and EMT-Basics do not always receive this essential training. A well linked educational process for those involved in mass casualty disaster preparation and response is not yet available.\n【40】 # Communications\n【41】 Effective and timely communications are essential to functional command and control; admittedly, communication failure (prehospital, hospital, and public) is a recurrent theme during and immediately after a disaster.\n【42】 # Transportation\n【43】 Coordinated transportation service is vital and often, timely and effective use of mutual aid transport units to transport or transfer patients to tertiary care is challenging. Additionally, there is currently no comprehensive plan for disaster response which effectively integrates civilian with military medical transport resources.\n【44】 # Infrastructure and Capacity\n【45】 Communities differ in their capabilities and infrastructure to handle disasters in the prehospital and hospital arenas. Regardless of a community's capabilities and the level of coordination between resources, those injured from an explosion will rapidly seek care from or will be transported to the nearest hospital, 28 and may not seek care at the facilities designated by existing response plans. Thus all communities need plans that have been successfully and repeatedly drilled. Additionally, facilities vary in capabilities and staffing. Any facility, whether it offers tertiary (i.e., specialty) care or community, rural, or alternate care, will undoubtedly face problems in several areas:\n【46】 - Personnel Shortages of qualified personnel, including nurses and specialized technicians, exist throughout our health care system. During a mass casualty event, these shortages could manifest to catastrophic levels. Some staff may not respond during a bombing or other disaster event for various reasons, including fear for personal safety, family issues, or injury. Estimating available staff may be difficult because many work at multiple facilities. Conversely, the screening, managing, and credentialing of well-intentioned volunteers during a disaster can be challenging, if not impossible.\n【47】 - Equipment and supplies Shortages of essential equipment and supplies often occur in the aftermath of a large-scale terrorist bombing or natural disaster. Moreover, most facilities in a given region use the same suppliers for back-up stock and equipment (e.g., pharmaceuticals, general medical supplies, ventilators).\n【48】 # Information technology (data management/data systems)\n【49】 Oftentimes, software systems involving EMS services, hospitals, and health departments are incompatible. To maximize patient outcomes and allow family members to quickly locate loved ones, a data management system must have the ability to track patients from the scene to the hospital, track patients throughout the facility, and track transfers to other facilities.\n【50】 # Cost\n【51】 Preparation and incident mitigation requires a commitment of resources.\n【52】 Training prehospital providers, stockpiling key equipment such as stretchers and reserving capacity in the blood supply will be expensive.\n【53】 # Interoperability\n【54】 An effective medical response to a terrorist bombing demands that the response system components (personnel, organizations, and command structures) are interoperable. Yet services, agencies, and systems are not integrated for maximum efficiency (i.e., equipment; preparation; communications; and incident command, both prehospital and hospital).\n【55】 # Potential Bottlenecks\n【56】 Despite the impact of these events on multiple areas of clinical care, there are some areas whose response and capability may impact patients across the spectrum of care:\n【57】 - Radiology Given the nature of injuries related to terrorist bombings, the most victims will undergo multiple radiology studies. In Madrid, 50 radiology studies and interventions were performed the day of the bombing. 14 The numbers of patients requiring studies may lead to a bottleneck, and hinder the institution's ability to streamline care. However, to date, professional radiology societies have not focused on surge capacity for bombing victims and the potential for radiology to become a bottleneck. Instead, they have focused exclusively on detection and treatment of radiation emergencies and disasters.\n【58】 # Critical Care\n【59】 If a terrorist bombing increases the demand for critical care/ICU services which, in turn, exceeds reserve ICU capacity, hospitals would have limited ability to divert or transfer patients to other hospitals and will need a plan in place to provide emergency mass critical care.\n【60】 # Pharmacy\n【61】 Ensuring an adequate supply of required pharmaceuticals throughout the institution, and community, is essential, and may prove challenging. This may be complicated by the fact, as noted above, that many facilities in a given region use the same suppliers for back-up stock and supply.\n【62】 # Triage\n【63】 Our current planning and preparedness activities assume that prehospital providers will be dispatched in coordinated fashion, will arrive on the scene to triage patients, and will transport them to the appropriate facilities, thereby preventing any component of the system from being overwhelmed. In many disasters, however, most victims self-transport or are transported by other laypersons. Victims do not wait for an organized field triage system to come into effect; consequently, the system or facilities are overwhelmed. 28\n【64】 # Legal Issues\n【65】 Multiple legal issues impact the response to a terrorist bombing or other major disaster, and may impact effective, coordinated medical care that optimally utilizes all of a community's resources. Examples include credentialing of providers; altered standards of care; standards for clinical documentation; the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).\n【66】 # Discipline-specific Challenges\n【67】 Each of the aforementioned problems has an impact on the spectrum of care; however, unique examples exist for many disciplines. The expert panel  identified the following discipline-specific challenges and provided feasible and affordable strategies for effectively addressing surge capacity. (The proposed solutions are provided in a template format at the end of this document.)\n【68】 # Emergency Medical Service Response\n【69】 As initial responders, EMS providers and personnel must confront several issues, including:\n【70】 - Personal protection Currently, there is no unified approach to protect rescuers or stage a response. When do appropriate concerns for scene safety and the potential for secondary explosive devices hinder the initial response?\n【71】 - Decontamination Though treatment will be delayed, decontamination may be imperative. Uniform policies and protocols for decontamination of personnel and patients need to be established for all scenarios (e.g., weather, bombing).\n【72】 # Incident command\n【73】 Interoperability between prehospital and hospital command structures is a challenge. This challenge manifests not only in the technical aspects of radio interoperability, but  in the interdisciplinary aspects of communications plans. A unified incident command structure must be incorporated into health care and EMS practice; further, EMS must be designated as part of the field response command structure.\n【74】 # Field triage\n【75】 Although multiple triage systems are used across the country, there is no agreed-upon methodology for field triage during a disaster.\n【76】 # Destination decisions\n【77】 Determining the appropriate destination in the aftermath of an event may be difficult, especially if the initial scene \"size-up\" has not been performed.\n【78】 - Hospital evacuations Whenever EMS transfers patients from hospitals to free up acute care beds, normal hospital functions are adversely affected.\n【79】 # Sustainability of operations\n【80】 Providing personnel with needed support (e.g., physical, emotional) and maintaining facilities, equipment and supplies in the aftermath of an event is an ongoing challenge.\n【81】 # Emergency Department Response\n【82】 The emergency department (ED) is a central portal to any hospital; as such, the ED is where initial information about a disaster is communicated. The challenge is to determine the magnitude of the event and initiate the appropriate institutional response. This response must be in concert with the assessed magnitude, including decisions to declare an institutional disaster, to declare an institutional lock-down, and to determine if recipient victim decontamination is needed. To determine the extent of the response, the quality and quantity of information from the field and between the regional emergency operations center and hospital is critical. Frequently, information challenges and communications are a source of failure.\n【83】 In a large-scale event, each hospital must have the capability to increase staffing, rapidly assess its available bed status, and make occupied beds available-especially in the ED, operating theatres, and critical care units. To free up beds, hospitals should cancel elective surgeries and admissions, open traditionally non-patient hospital areas for patient care (e.g., classrooms, offices, etc), and begin early discharge for inpatients as appropriate.\n【84】 During a mass casualty event, transfer of patients to an alternative care site may be delayed due to the time, personnel, and equipment needed to set up that site. However, development of an alternative site will, over time, free up non-critical care beds.\n【85】 # Key issues follow:\n【86】 - Ascertaining the validity and scope of the event. Notification is essential to activate and implement an appropriate response; information/updates must be consistent and frequent.\n【87】 - Incident command. A Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) must be implemented within the ED, hospital, and community. HICS is a widely used emergency management system known for providing a chain of command that can mobilize at a moments notice, provide accountability of position functions, allow flexible responses to emergencies, improve documentation of facility actions, provide a common language to facilitate outside assistance, and develop prioritized response checklists for senior leadership. Each hospital should be part of a regional unified command structure.\n【88】 - Discharging patients from the ED. To free up resources, patients should be discharged, or transferred to other areas for care.\n【89】 # Surgical and Intensive Care Unit Response\n【90】 Multiple factors affect trauma surgery and its preparedness and response to a bombing event or natural disaster.\n【91】 # Changes in surgical practice\n【92】 The recent increased interest in disaster response capabilities is in contrast to the general surgery community's decreased interest in managing emergency surgery. Thus, the knowledge base and skill set to manage a Madrid-type scenario is being concentrated at fewer hospitals. Many hospitals with the capacity to handle surge, as it relates to beds and staffing, have little technical capability to manage a surge of patients from a bombing.\n【93】 # Time of day\n【94】 As in the Madrid bombings, the time of the event is critical for trauma centers and community hospitals. However, disaster planning often does not consider time of day. At 0200 hours, for example, a community hospital may not have operating theatre capability.\n【95】 # Limited ICU beds\n【96】 Overcrowding may require decisions to delay surgeries, identify beds in other areas of the hospital, and/or transfer patients to another facility.\n【97】 # Loss of excess capacity/Capacity on a given day\n【98】 The U.S. health care system has systematically and deliberately eliminated capacity because unused capacity is an additional expense.\n【99】 # Education\n【100】 More surgeons, especially those in trauma centers, need further education on the planning and response process. The U.S. military in Iraq has successfully demonstrated concepts in surgical surge capacity management that should be translated immediately to civilian medicine. Further, Iraq's experience with damage-control (emergency) surgery has shown that more patients' lives can be saved through temporizing damage-control surgery than if patients received time-consuming definitive surgery.\n【101】 Additionally, after a terrorist attack, critical care and ICU services will be needed to treat the seriously ill or injured casualties. The emergency mass critical care plan should address hemodynamic resuscitation and support using intravenous fluids and vasopressors; administration of antibiotic and other disease-specific countermeasures; prophylactic interventions to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness; and basic modes of mechanical ventilation, and should inclu\n【102】 1. Interventions that improve survival; without which death is likely;\n【103】 2. Interventions that do not require extraordinarily expensive equipment; and . Interventions that do not consume extensive staff or hospital resources.\n【104】 If ventilators are unavailable to treat all patients in need, minimally skilled individuals could use an endotracheal tube to manually ventilate the patient. Critical care areas should be equipped to measure, at a minimum, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, and urine output. When critical care/ICUs are full, hospitals can create additional capacity in non-ICU rooms concentrated on specific wards or floors. Patient care areas that already contain equipment similar to ICU's (endoscopy and surgical suites) are good alternatives, but these ad hoc critical care areas will increase capacity only slightly and require cessation of services normally provided.\n【105】 When a hospital cannot meet increased demand for critical care services using its existing critical care practitioners, a two-tiered staffing model comprising noncritical care physicians and nurses may be substituted. Members of the Working Group on Emergency Mass Critical Care (Center for Bioterrorism at the University of Pittsburgh) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine concluded that a critical care physician can supervise up to four noncritical care physicians who can each manage up to six critically-ill patients. They  concluded that a critical care nurse could supervise up to three noncritical care nurses with each caring for up to two patients. In this model, a hospital's critical care staff is multiplied to where one critical care physician could oversee the care of up to 24 critically-ill patients, and one critical care nurse could oversee the care of up to six critically-ill patients. 29 Additionally, many of our nation's leading children's hospitals with large Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) operate at maximum capacity. If a mass casualty involving children and infants were to occur, the PICUs' response and ability to provide intensive care would be severely constrained.\n【106】 The emotional issues surrounding the care for a dying or dead child compounds this issue as paramedics, physicians, and others generally do not want to pronounce children dead at the scene. Thus, they will transport a child who has been pulseless and apneic for an hour, and still hopelessly receiving CPR, to the ED and ultimately to the PICU where the child will be declared deceased. Such considerations affect field triage and care in a mass casualty situation. Finally, PICUs have a chronic shortage of trained, available, and experienced staff.\n【107】 # Radiology Response\n【108】 # Blood Bank Response\n【109】 In the last 0 years, the United States has experienced only five disasters in which more than 100 units of blood were used. If a large-scale terrorist bombing took place, large amounts of blood would be needed only if many victims were seriously injured.\n【110】 The blood banking community has formed an interorganizational task force to address blood needs in the event of a disaster. The AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic Disasters and Acts of Terrorism (AABB Interorganizational Task Force) unites national blood organizations representing virtually all the nation's blood centers (AABB, America's Blood Centers, and American Red Cross) and hospital and supplier associations with liaisons from the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, CDC, and Armed Services Blood Program to coordinate efforts in preparation for and response to disasters affecting the blood supply. Potential issues with our nation's blood supply follow:\n【111】 - Disruption of the blood supply system Lack of blood will probably not be a problem, but disruption or interference of the blood supply system could wreak havoc. During times of disaster, including terrorist attacks, Americans will search for ways to help. Potential donors will descend on hospitals and blood centers and quickly overburden the system. Blood collection, processing, and testing are highly regulated procedures in a technical system that requires trained staff. On September 11, 2001, New York and New Jersey used 224 units of blood, while Washington and Virginia used 4-totaling 258 units, all of which were on the shelf before the disaster occurred. 0 Across the nation, more than a half million potential donor's volunteered blood.\n【112】 In the event of a disaster, the AABB Interorganizational Task Force will inform the American public if blood donations are needed and tell them how and where to donate. In most instances, the appropriate message is that additional blood is not needed immediately after the disaster, but that individuals should contact their local blood centers to schedule a donation in the upcoming weeks.\n【113】 # Transportation of blood\n【114】 Even when blood products are not shelved at the surge capacity site, the products can be available in hours. In fact, blood can be transported to a disaster location faster than donations can be processed. There are some issues with transporting blood; for example, authorization may be required to transport blood around the state or country. In addition, blood centers may have difficulty obtaining diesel and unleaded fuel to power generators or to operate staff vehicles that transport blood. Federal, state, and local emergency preparedness offices need to make blood products a priority for obtaining transportation and fuel.\n【115】 # Local organization\n【116】 In a disaster, blood needs to be placed exactly where it is needed-at the hospitals serving the large influx of patients. Few hospitals regularly collect blood; fewer still are capable of handling an influx of donors while caring for disaster patients. In some metropolitan areas, hospitals may be served almost entirely by one blood center; in other areas, hospitals might get blood regularly from several sources. Planned and coordinated efforts are needed during a disaster to know which blood centers will service the hospitals at surge capacity. Within an hour of a disaster, the AABB Interorganizational Task Force will convene a conference call of national blood organizations, HHS, and local affected blood centers to determine local needs for blood and actions necessary to meet those needs. The Task Force will meet again hours or days later to coordinate subsequent blood-related efforts.\n【117】 # Staff who can administer blood\n【118】 Most hospitals aim for a three-day supply of blood. If blood is not stored at the hospital; typically, the blood can be readily accessed. For a hospital to consume a three-day blood supply in three hours is highly unlikely. Instead, the hospital may have too few trained staff to administer blood. Several documents are available to assist blood centers, hospital blood banks, and transfusion services prepare for and respond to disasters and acts of terrorism that could affect the blood supply. 1-\n【119】 # Hospitalists' Reponse\n【120】 By the end of this decade, there will be more hospitalists (physicians or internists caring for hospital patients) than other medical subspecialties; currently, half the hospitals with 200 or more beds employ hospitalists. Although they may not be directly involved in the care of casualties from a terrorist event, hospitalists will be vital in rapidly discharging inpatients, accepting transfers from ICUs, and freeing bed space for victims.\n【121】 # Administration Response\n【122】 When an institution is stressed clinically, it will  be stressed administratively. Hospitals face formidable challenges in the post-911 era. Shrinking revenue margins put pressure on budgets and complicate investment decisions to purchase items for contingency operations. Unlike nations with publicly funded health systems, the U.S. health care industry must support its contingency investment needs by pooling a mix of private funding with local, state, and federal resources. As a result, every hospital has some capability, but the clinical and administrative capabilities of each vary widely.\n【123】 The United States has 4,919 community hospitals, of which 221 are major teaching hospitals. The major teaching hospitals are components of academic medical centers, often include a Level 1 trauma center, and may coordinate local EMS transport. These 221 hospitals are the focal points of graduate medical education, technology, and tertiary services. Should an incident occur, these hospitals will be expected to serve the local community, through either direct clinical care or system coordination. Maintaining these hospitals in the face of falling revenue margins strains the ability of any organization to support infrastructure for \"response capability.\"\n【124】 The rest of the hospital industry is similarly stressed. Total staffed beds in the United States have dropped to just below 956,000. Outsourcing outpatient services and procedures to non-hospital settings further reduces revenue. Less money means less opportunity to invest in hospital infrastructure, which gradually erodes sophisticated diagnostic services in hospitals and complicates our nation's health care industry from responding in traditional ways, let alone under extraordinary circumstances.\n【125】 Within each community, leadership from the health care industry is a key element in an effective response. Hospital executives recognize that major events will activate political and law enforcement leadership and that they must be proactive and form professional and collegial contacts with community leaders. Similarly, hospitals must be linked to provide mutual aid and assist patient transfers. Businesses function on increasingly narrow inventory levels, and hospitals in the same community usually rely on the same suppliers. In a crisis, suppliers will resort to rationing inventory. Regional and multistate mutual aid plans should be developed; but in catastrophic events, help from those outside the affected zone may take days to arrive, underscoring the need to identify resources to support three days of operations before reordering supplies.\n【126】 Hospital responses to mass casualty events are often chaotic. In part, this is due to lack of training and experience, but the disorganized response is compounded by not having an appropriate command structure such as the HICS. Use of an appropriate incident command system does not guarantee a successful response, but without one, failure is almost certain. Hospital personnel need to understand the concept of regional unified command and be willing to participate appropriately during a disaster.\n【127】 When a situation demands swift action, hospital administrators have to focus on many areas simultaneously. Using a step-by-step approach, administrators can bring some order to chaos and, in fact, improve response times and save lives. Administrators should focus on the critical areas listed below:\n【128】 - Control of the external environment The external environment will change rapidly during a large event.\n【129】 Maintaining control of hospital grounds (e.g., facility security and traffic) is essential. Clearing beds to accommodate incoming casualties, redirecting nonemergency patients to other resources, and managing overall comings and goings of staff will require effective control of the external environment, including media control.\n【130】 # Implementation of Hospital Incident Command System\n【131】 In a fast-paced disaster like the Madrid bombings, it is of crucial importance to have identified the appropriate decision-makers beforehand for the HICS. In a crisis, there is little time for meetings or discussion about the appropriate use of support functions and personnel.\n【132】 # Personnel Issues\n【133】 There should be a balance between the individual needs of staff and the organization as a whole to assure adequate coverage for short-and long-term medical responses. Decisions must be made early about when staff can go home to check on family members or what to do if staffers leave in the middle of the response. A method to request additional staff on short notice coupled with defining an individual institution's surge capacity can assist in finding the right mix of clinical and nonclinical support to handle the increased workload.\n【134】 # Memorandums of Understanding or Agreement\n【135】 Prescripted agreements to share supplies, personnel, or equipment should be written and drilled to support local, regional, and state partners in time of need.\n【136】 - Logistics and supplies Coordination with key suppliers and maintenance of inventories throughout the health system will make ramping up the level of effort easier. Depending on the event, some areas (i.e., obstetrics, outpatient surgery, and various clinics) may not be directly affected and could provide supplies. Effective logistics management would  include patient transportation to and from appropriate care settings. Although the housing of evacuees is a municipal function, knowing the locations of designated Red Cross shelters throughout the vicinity and transportation resources for low-acuity patients and their family members will hasten discharge planning and improve patient flow in the ED.\n【137】 - Alternate care sites A hospital is most effective when it can mobilize quickly and expand care to the city's walking wounded. Triage systems are typically used to prioritize patients so that low-priority patients can be directed from the main hospital, thus allowing ambulances and hospital staff to focus on high-priority patients (i.e., burns, dehydration, multiple injuries). Alternate sites may allow large health systems to facilitate triage and direct patients and families to appropriate sources of care.\n【138】 # Credentialing\n【139】 The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) emergency credentialing system does work, but it must be tested within an organization before it is needed. State Emergency Systems for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP) reflect JCAHO requirements and provide a standardized set of verified credentials for volunteers who may be called to assist hospitals during emergency situations. Many aspects of staff credentialing and privileging can be streamlined, but the formal enrollment cannot be circumvented. In most hospitals, formal enrollment provides access to entering orders, prescribing modalities, writing prescriptions, ordering laboratory tests, and documenting care using automated systems. No matter whether credentialing is handled by human resources or a professional staffing office, the design of the system should support the use of volunteers in nonclinical activities.\n【140】 # Patient tracking\n【141】 Tracking patient movement is a critical function during any mass casualty situation. Successful tracking begins at the point a patient enters the health care system. When more time is spent identifying and tracking patients, the prospect of reimbursement for related costs is better. The ability to track patients, identify their supply consumption, and monitor bed use enables senior management to proactively meet the needs of health care providers on the frontline. Many patient tracking systems exist, and if at all possible, the system should allow automated tracking for exercises and real disasters.\n【142】 This list is not all encompassing for every facility. The staff of any health care organization should periodically evaluate areas like plant management, social work resources, safety, materials management, biomedical equipment and repair, service procurement, and patient admittance to help prepare for the unexpected. Often, disaster preparedness is focused solely on the transfer of care between provider and patient and not on the infrastructure to support the effort.\n【143】 # Surge Capacity Solutions\n【144】 Addressing System-wide Challenges How do we address acute events that stress our overburdened system? Apparently, we must prepare for the predictable surprise-a bombing-which is the most common form of terrorist attack. The United States has a basic, functional capability to respond to the surge of patients following a terrorist event such as a bombing; however, several critical areas must be addressed for effective surge capacity to occur. To address the system specific challenges related to surge capacity that are highlighted above, the expert panel outlined the following recommendations for each challenge.\n【145】 # Organization and Leadership\n【146】 Leadership is important for successful preparedness and response at all levels-field, hospital, city, state, and federal-and it is mandatory in the planning and response phases.\n【147】 # Alterations in Standards of Care\n【148】 Culturally, the United States may need to revise its stance on health care. Instead of doing the greatest good for the individual, we may need to do the greatest good for the community (i.e., save the most victims). There is, however, no universally accepted methodology of doing this, and the process is fraught with ethical, societal, medical, and legal issues. A protocol is needed to determine when and how to deviate from the norm without the civilian health care provider or facility experiencing repercussions. An altered protocol would improve the civilian sector's ability to manage patient assessment, treatment, flow, and outcomes for the greatest number of patients. It is clear that changing standards of care will require efforts to preserve quality of care, a formal process in each community to determine when and how to transition from standard operating procedures to an altered standard of care, and determining who will have the authority to order the transition. In August 2004, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened a panel of experts to examine the complex issues surrounding alterations in clinical care. Their findings are published in the monograph Altered Standards of Care in Mass Casualty Events. 4 The rationale for suspending standards of care in an emergency is that more patients will survive a terrorist attack if key interventions are provided to the greatest numbers of casualties likely to benefit from receiving care. Hospitals and EMS systems at surge capacity will require autonomy to suspend regular standards of care and shift to emergency critical care practices.\n【149】 - Although care can be altered at the institutional level, if all hospitals affected by a crisis switch to emergency critical care practice standards at the same time, more patients will receive effective care.\n【150】 - The ethical, political, legal, regulatory, and logistical implications of suspending standards of care and triaging patients to limited resources will require the participation of state and federal government. Legislation will be required to suspend standards of medical practice during an emergency without practitioners and hospitals incurring legal liability.\n【151】 - A mechanism is needed to address issues associated with change from routine to altered (emergency) standards of care/sufficiency of care.\n【152】 - Community education before, during, and after an event is necessary for acceptance and understanding.\n【153】 # Education\n【154】 Educational efforts must include an all-hazards approach that addresses the most likely, predictable terrorist event: a bombing. The education given to care providers should reflect the potential severity of the event. Training must be standardized across all levels of providers so that there is consistency among the disciplines.\n【155】 Training should address clinical care and systems issues.\n【156】 # Communications\n【157】 Communication plans should include interoperable, redundant regional emergency communications systems, ideally with multi-frequency bands, and trunked systems with the capability to pool user groups (for example, among hospitals) via the incident command structure. If a catastrophic incident results in massive power failure, emergency backup systems, such as mobile satellite telephones, will be needed along with other conventional methods of communication. Communication plans  should address command and control structures and disaster crisis counseling.\n【158】 Informatics and data systems link information for real-time impact (i.e., which hospitals have beds, where patients can be diverted, how to find loved ones, and how to access survival data). Without patient tracking and informatics, no one will be able to evaluate what works and what does not work in a given situation.\n【159】 # Transportation\n【160】 The military is probably the only group with the capability to transport patients on a large scale; however, not on short order, as it may take hours to arrange a single transfer. Regional, statewide, and national plans and agreements should address the roles of National Guard and active-duty military personnel for providing large scale air medical resources on relatively short notice. There may  be a need to integrate private and public transportation resources with military resources.\n【161】 # Infrastructure and Capacity\n【162】 Given the wide variability that exists nationwide, basic strategies and solutions must be developed to enable our hospital and medical system infrastructures to respond more effectively to mass casualty events.\n【163】 # Potential Bottlenecks - Radiology\n【164】 Perhaps a minimalist approach to using radiology makes sense-identifying and standardizing a baseline that could be used in many facilities. By identifying and addressing critical life threats and major problems through \"tiered\" reports-initial \"wet\" interpretations that are made and left with/on the patient and acted on when resources become available and final reports and interpretations are completed-both patient flow and care may be greatly improved.\n【165】 # Critical Care\n【166】 Plans must be in place to provide for emergency mass critical care, including basic modes of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic resuscitation and support using intravenous fluids and vasopressors, administration of antibiotics and other disease-specific countermeasures, and prophylactic interventions to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness. If an event exceeds a locality's critical care/ICU capacity, hospitals must be able to activate emergency mass critical care practices, suspending usual standards of care and defining patients and interventions of highest priority.\n【167】 # Pharmacy\n【168】 Pharmacies must be prepared, and the role of pharmaceutical systems in the overall response falls into two areas:\n【169】 - Selection of the proper pharmaceuticals for stockpiling, and - Proper stockpiling of \"CHEMPACKS.\"\n【170】 # Triage\n【171】 Preparedness and response plans must recognized that there are no evidence based standards for mass casualty events, including those that result from terrorist bombings, and that field triage often does not occur for the majority of injured victims. Response plans must account for the self referral of patients to nearby hospitals, and the impact this phenomena may have on the care of the critically injured.\n【172】 # Legal Issues\n【173】 Issues related to EMTALA, HIPAA, and provider credentialing must be addressed on both a national and local level, to ensure that the emergency medical system and individual providers can respond in a timely and effective manner.\n【174】 Addressing Discipline-specific Challenges Our nation's health care system has a chronic problem with managing surge capacity. Providers and administrators struggle daily to provide the full spectrum of injury care for victims of trauma, placing our preparedness for terrorism in a precarious position.\n【175】 This section contains nine templates developed by the expert panel to help various disciplines address issues of surge capacity. Though developed in the context of a surge of injuries from a terrorist bombing, the recommendations in this section may improve the response to and management of a surge of patients from any cause, including biological, chemical, or nuclear. Most, but not all, of these disciplines (e.g., \"Drugs and Pharmaceutical Supplies\" and \"Nursing Care\") have been discussed in the preceding sections. However these issues represent a significant concern for systems planners and therefore, the expert panel felt they must be included in the solutions section. Because many disciplines will be affected simultaneously, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a longitudinal timeline. For this reason, the templates are listed in a general order of flow through the system. Along with providing general information (i.e., purpose, background, goals), each template provides basic, and in most cases, low-cost strategies that can be implemented rapidly to avoid problems associated with managing surge capacity. The templates emphasize the importance of practicing and evaluating plans.\n【176】 The templates are intended as guides only, as needs, preferences, and capabilities vary among communities. Furthermore, templates propose solutions that assume communities are already actively engaged in disaster planning and preparedness activities; therefore, it is expected that a significant portion of the personnel and resource costs would be absorbed by these ongoing activities. Exact costs should be determined by local communities and institutions therein.\n【177】 # Managing Surge Needs for Injuries: Emergency Medical Service Response\n【178】 # PURPOSE\n【179】 To provide guidance for local emergency medical service (EMS) response and to operationalize additional EMS-related resources needed in a community within four hours of an explosion. These resources are intended to treat 00 injured patients for up to 72 hours.\n【180】 # GOAL\n【181】 To mobilize the appropriate number and type of EMS resources to adequately evaluate injuries, initiate triage, begin transporting 00 injured patients, and to establish ongoing EMS operations for up to 72 hours.\n【182】 This document is a resource guide. Local needs, preferences, and capabilities of affected communities may vary.\n【183】 # REQUIRED RESOURCES\n【184】 1. Personnel must be:\n【185】 - Appropriately equipped and knowledgeable about chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) detection, personal protection, and decontamination.\n【186】 - Educated in the care of blast-related injuries for adult and pediatric patients.\n【187】 - Prepared to institute triage.\n【188】 - Prepared to institute and participate in unified incident command.\n【189】 2. A communications system that is interoperable with public safety disciplines (fire, law enforcement, EMS, and emergency management) and with receiving hospitals and local public health officials.\n【190】 . Rapid access to sufficient ambulance resources to transport critically injured patients.\n【191】 4. Rapid access to sufficient alternative resources (e.g., buses) to transport noncritical, injured persons.\n【192】 Have the necessary material and the capability to detect CBRNE agents to assist with decontamination plans. Fire, EMS, law enforcement, emergency management, hospitals, and public health should collaborate to develop and complete written plans within six months, as listed below. Within one year, other agencies listed in these plans (including mutual aid agencies, etc.) must be included in ongoing planning and evaluation.\n【193】 - Plan for mobilizing 50 ambulances within 10 minutes after the blast. At least 75% of these resources should arrive at staging areas in the first hour with all arriving in the first 90 minutes. This should be accomplished using 9-1-1 EMS resources, mutual aid agreements with other EMS providers, or mutual aid agreements with nonemergency transport providers.\n【194】 - Plan describing each agency's role in the command structure. This should include how critical functions of command, staging, triage, and treatment will be accomplished in the first 10 minutes of a response; how additional ICS elements will be filled over the first hour; and how the ICS structure will be formally filled by officials trained in advanced ICS (ICS-700 or equivalent) by the end of the first hour. - Plan describing how alternative transport for 200 ambulatory patients will be initiated in the first 10 minutes after an explosion. - Plan describing the details of interdisciplinary communications (primary and alternatives). Representatives from fire prevention, EMS, law enforcement, emergency management, hospitals, and public health must be included in this plan. - Plan for decontaminating and protecting personnel that addresses the following:\n【195】 - -How sites can be activated and staffed with at least one transport ambulance, sufficient law enforcement personnel for security, and adequate support staff to record arrivals. -How gross and technical decontamination could be accomplished at affected site(s).\n【196】 -How medical care at secondary triage sites could be converted to treatment areas (e.g., provision of medical supplies, additional medical personnel, and other logistical concerns).\n【197】 - Plan to establish criteria for determination of death at the scene, particularly in a mass casualty situation, and appropriately manage the deceased.\n【198】 # EVALUATION\n【199】 1. Plan and conduct a community-wide drill. Afterwards, evaluate it by assessing overall operations and EMS resources such as personnel, ambulances, and PPE. Evaluate compliance with NIMS.\n【200】 2. Assess and refine plan.\n【201】 # Managing Surge Needs for Injuries: Emergency Department Response\n【202】 # PURPOSE\n【203】 To activate additional emergency department resources needed within four hours of an explosion. These resources should treat 00 injured patients for up to 72 hours.\n【204】 # BACKGROUND INJURY PREVENTION\n【205】 The experiences of the Madrid terrorist bombings were used as a model to help\n【206】 # GOAL\n【207】 To establish policies, procedures, didactic training, and drills to improve institutional preparedness for treating 00 injured patients for up to 72 hours.\n【208】 # RESOURCES REQUIRED\n【209】 There should be adequate medical, nursing, and support staff to provide initial triage, and to evaluate and stabilize 00 persons.\n【210】 This document is a resource guide. Local needs, preferences, and capabilities of affected communities may vary.\n【211】 # ASSUMPTIONS\n【212】 1. Developed packets for each patient containing disaster bands (those from blood banks work best), manual charting forms, and manual lab and radiology order forms. These packets should be prepared in advance and stored in the ED.\n【213】 2. Established procedures for obtaining additional personnel, equipment, supplies and beds; establish a mechanism for notifying and activating backup personnel.\n【214】 . Established procedures for triage, patient emergency identification of patients and discharge, and quick documentation.\n【215】 4. Established temporary disaster log to document basic information.\n【216】 # ACTION STEPS\n【217】 1. Implement and drill a hospital emergency incident command system (such as Hospital Incident Command System or \"HICS\"); include clinical care providers in the training and drill.\n【218】 If hospital personnel (e.g., practitioners, administrators, nurses) have not trained or drilled in a hospital incident command system, learned about the National Incident Management System (NIMS), or do not understand the function of a Hospital Incident Command Center, this information should be included in training sessions.\n【219】 2. Instruct clinical staff, especially surgeons and emergency physicians, about the unique aspects of blast-related injuries and care following an attack with a radiation dispersal device (RDD).\n【220】 . Establish an institutional lockdown process and drill on a regular basis; include radiation detection and decontamination of arriving patients.\n【221】 4. Update the institutional call-down list and perform a functional call-down exercise.\n【222】 5. Identify potential institutional surge staffing from employees with clinical training, but not currently tasked with clinical jobs.\n【223】 6. Identify patient care supplies for a surge situation, such as additional IV equipment, bandages/dressings, gowns, gloves, masks, other operating room supplies, etc.\n【224】 7. Develop a regional Unified Command Structure that includes local emergency management and area hospitals. This should be achieved under the guidance and leadership of the local emergency managers.\n【225】 8. Identify non-patient care areas in the institution that could be converted to patient care to expand bed surge capacity.\n【226】 9. Establish and drill a procedure for early patient discharge to increase bed capacity. This procedure should include evaluation of ICU patients for potential movement to a non-ICU bed and evaluation of all patients for potential early discharge or transfer to an alternative care site (internal or external to the institution).\n【227】 # EVALUATION\n【228】 When appropriate, evaluation drills have been incorporated into the \"Action Steps\" listed above. The institutional disaster preparedness plan should be updated based on each drill experience.\n【229】 Managing Surge Needs for Injuries:\n【230】 # Surgical and Intensive Care Unit Response\n【231】 # PURPOSE\n【232】 To mobilize and assign operating rooms and related assets for life-and limb-saving surgical care to the most critically injured of 00 patients from explosions (care extends to patients from the community with acute surgical illness for up to 72 hours after a bombing).\n【233】 # INJURY PREVENTION\n【234】 Emergency Medical\n【235】 # BACKGROUND Service Response\n【236】 The Madrid terrorist bombings were used as a model to help develop solutions for\n【237】 # GOAL\n【238】 Within two hours of a blast event, establish incident command for the operating rooms and surgical support areas for up to 72 hours.\n【239】 # RESOURCES REQUIRED\n【240】 Resources needed for communicating within the organization and with the community (e.g., satellite phone, walkie-talkie).\n【241】 This document is a resource guide. Local needs, preferences, and capabilities of affected communities may vary.\n【242】 # ASSUMPTIONS\n【243】 1. Operating room  assets are a critical component of surge capacity after an explosion and must be mobilized quickly.\n【244】 2. The  capacity of any institution or community (i.e., number of operating rooms) is fixed because of structural requirements.\n【245】 . One or more surgeons, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists will be in the hospital or available immediately after an event.\n【246】 4. Other surgeons, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists can be available within two hours of an event to provide direct patient care in the ORs and related areas.\n【247】 5. The ORs, post-anesthesia care units (PACU), and intensive care units will already be in use. 6. Casualties of the blast and patients already in the hospital system or in other treatment centers in the community will occupy one or more of these three areas within the next 72 hours.\n【248】 7. If these areas are not made available in a timely manner, patients will suffer greater harm.\n【249】 8. Some patients could be moved to different care sites.\n【250】 9. Federal resources cannot be expected to arrive sooner than 72 hours from the time of an explosion.\n【251】 # ACTION STEPS\n【252】 The near-term (six months) solutions listed below include estimated hours for each task. 1. Identify medical leadership within surgery and anesthesiology for disaster planning.\n【253】 - Leadership should collaborate in the design, implementation, and refinement of an incident command system for an operating room. Initially, leadership in surgery and anesthesiology should meet with representatives from critical care, emergency medicine, administration, and others involved with the institution's disaster planning. These discussions will be facilitated by appointing a hospital disaster committee.\n【254】 2. Select individuals for incident command roles.\n【255】 - Specify the authority, processes, and responsibilities of the  incident command and a call schedule identifying individuals available to fill their roles 24 hours a day, beginning within two hours of the event, and extending for 72 hours. - Although individuals from several disciplines and departments in the operating room and related areas may assist the incident command, final decision-making authority should rest with one person-an \"Operating Room Czar.\" The  Czar would have authority to cancel scheduled  cases, rearrange  schedules, identify patients that could be transferred, call in and deploy  teams, and prioritize patients for beds in the , PACU, and ICUs. The  Czar would report to hospital incident command. - Candidates for this role should be able to assess the medical needs of a variety of patients requiring  services. They must be physicians, and would most likely be surgeons. An individual serving in this role should not have primary patient care responsibility at the same time (i.e., be part of a surgical team). - Communication systems linking surgery, nursing, anesthesiology, critical care, emergency department, and hospital administration should be specified. - The  incident command system must account for personnel availability at different times of the day and week and provide for transfer of incident command responsibility as the incident evolves over 72 hours. - The circumstances under which the  incident command begins and ends should be specified. - Methods for data collection, testing, monitoring, and improving the system should be specified.\n【256】 . Assure that individuals who might assume an incident command role are knowledgeable about incident command, operations of other hospital components, and community disaster response. Determine when individuals should be present onsite. Review triage decisions, quality, quantity, and appropriateness of information obtained from and given to others, including hospital incident command, emergency medicine, and other community assets.\n【257】 2. Refine and conduct further planning based on drill experience.\n【258】 immediate (\"wet\") readings of plain films and special studies. This will assist in rapid evaluation and treatment of patients. The plan should  optimize and streamline radiology study protocols for use during a mass casualty event.\n【259】 Enhanced radiology patient throughput will be essential in the initial evaluation and treatment of blast-injuries. Each radiology department must develop a plan to ensure rapid turnaround of patient studies and their results.\n【260】 2. When disaster patients arrive, a radiology ultrasound technician should be available in the emergency department to support the performance of an immediate FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) exam. If this is not possible, the emergency physicians and trauma surgeons should be trained to conduct one.\n【261】 . Conduct an imaging equipment survey; evaluate the status of the equipment for multiple traumas, making sure there are adequate amounts of portable equipment available and update if needed.\n【262】 Radiology equipment is expensive and usually requires planning in advance for acquisition and installation. However, by evaluating how available equipment could be put to maximum use during a mass casualty event can improve patient throughput.\n【263】 4. Establish a protocol for augmenting patient movement and monitoring in the radiology department. Afterwards, review the availability of patient monitoring personnel and equipment to enhance departmental throughput, especially for studies such as CT scans.\n【264】 # EVALUATION\n【265】 Where appropriate, evaluation drills have been incorporated into the \"Action Steps\" listed above. The institutional disaster preparedness plan should be updated based on each drill experience.\n【266】 -Facilities currently maintain about a three-day supply of blood products-which may need to be expanded to a seven-day supply. -Typically, fewer casualties require blood products than the total number of victims.\n【267】 -Local communities have limited sources of blood products.\n【268】 -If faced with a surge in demand, blood products will likely be transported from blood centers outside the local area. - After a disaster, the public usually responds by volunteering to donate larger quantities of blood products than are needed.\n【269】 -An influx of blood donors could tax collecting and processing efforts.\n【270】 -When resources (personnel, equipment, and supplies) are unnecessarily applied to collecting and processing unneeded products, these resources cannot process and distribute available and urgently needed products to those in urgent need. - The media must continuously provide the community with reliable information about the need and supply of blood products.\n【271】 - There are limited personnel with the training, education, and skills to process and administer blood products within treating facilities.\n【272】 -Additional qualified laboratory personnel may be needed to process requests for blood products. -Additional nursing personnel may be needed to administer blood products.\n【273】 - There may be limited methods of transporting or transferring blood products from supplier to destination during a disaster.\n【274】 -Commercial transport (air and ground) may be limited.\n【275】 -Blood needs are considered by federal, state, and local governments to be a critical element of the public health infrastructure in times of emergency. - The AABB Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic Disasters and Acts of Terrorism, formed in January 2002, has developed a process to educate the community about donations and how to collect, process, and move blood products at the time of a disaster.\n【276】 -This multi-organizational task force includes federal and national organizations.\n【277】 -Published references include a Disaster Operations Handbook and a hospital supplement that addresses these issues. They include a flow chart outlining the process for involving the AABB and appropriate national and federal organizations that provide blood products during a disaster.\n【278】 # ACTION STEPS\n【279】 - Work with AABB to distribute documents to hospitals and blood collection organizations/facilities.\n【280】 - Identify resources (personnel, equipment, supplies) to meet local needs for collection, processing, distribution, and transfusion of blood products. This effort must include local media to provide consistent messages to the community about blood products, supply, and needs. (Note: Individual hospitals and collection organizations incorporate the AABB process into their local disaster response plans.)\n【281】 - Work with other organizations and government agencies (local, regional, state, federal) to make sure blood products are considered critical elements of the public health infrastructure in the event of a disaster/emergency.\n【282】 # EVALUATION\n【283】 - Ensure that survey hospitals and collection organizations incorporate AABB processes into local disaster response plans after 4 to 6 months.\n【284】 - Request that hospitals and collection organizations participate in a local or regional exercise requiring administration of blood products within four hours of an event for up to 72 hours.\n【285】 -Include activation and response of the AABB system, and local, regional, and state resources in the exercise.\n【286】 # GOAL\n【287】 To organize and support response to influx of 00 patients injured from an explosion for a 72-hour period.\n【288】 # RESOURCES REQUIRED\n【289】 The workload associated with an administrative response will require access to multiple facilities to support the needs of patients, staff, and the general public. Administrators will manage communications, acquire political support, work with and respond to media, handle public inquiries, manage internal systems and departments.\n【290】 This document is a resource guide. Local needs, preferences, and capabilities of the affected communities may vary.\n【291】 # ASSUMPTIONS\n【292】 - Health care systems and hospitals should function as an integrated system for the best use of resources.\n【293】 - A medical response to a mass casualty event must be comprehensive, community based, and coordinated.\n【294】 - Legal and regulatory issues need to be included in the hospital emergency preparedness plan: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act\n【295】 # ACTION STEPS\n【296】 The solutions listed below include estimated hours for each task.\n【297】 # Control of the External Environment\n【298】 The external environment will change rapidly during a large-scale, mass casualty event.\n【299】 The hospital must be secured and campus traffic must be controlled. Such control of the external environment includes clearing beds to accommodate incoming casualties, redirecting non-emergency patients to other resources, and managing the comings and goings of staff. Managing media relations can be challenging when trying to provide safe and effective care. The institution's security and public affairs offices must work together and be in place before the media arrives.\n【300】 # Activation of Hospital Incident Command System (HICS)\n【301】 HICS, a widely used emergency management system, is known for providing a chain of command with the ability to effectively manage an incident, provide accountability of position functions, allow for a flexible response to specific emergencies, improve documentation of facility actions, provide a common language to facilitate outside assistance, and develop prioritized response checklists for senior leadership. Identifying the appropriate people to make decisions is pivotal in a fast-paced disaster, such as in the Madrid bombings. There is little time for meetings and discussion about the appropriate use of support functions and personnel. Staff should be trained and drilled regularly to ingrain the difference between incident structure and normal operations.\n【302】 # Logistics and Supplies\n【303】 Coordinating with key suppliers and maintaining current inventories throughout the health system will make stocking efforts easier. When resources are limited, providers must be prepared to respond to care needs with whatever is available.\n【304】 Logistics include, but are not limited to, patient transportation. For example, housing evacuees and the walking wounded and their families is a function of the emergency management program. Knowing the locations of designated shelters throughout the vicinity and transportation resources for low-acuity patients and their families will hasten discharge planning and patient flow in acute care facilities.\n【305】 # Alternate Care Sites\n【306】 A hospital's ability to mobilize emergency care units and to extend care to the city's walking wounded adds to its effectiveness. Triage systems are used to prioritize patients so that low-priority patients can be directed from the main hospital, allowing ambulances and hospital staff to focus on high-priority trauma patients in need of medical assistance. Alternate sites, like the ones used during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, allow large health systems to facilitate triage and direct patients to appropriate sources of care.\n【307】 # Credentialing\n【308】 The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) emergency credentialing system must be tested within an organization before it is really needed. State Emergency Systems for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP) reflect JCAHO requirements and provide a standardized set of verified credentials for volunteers who may be called to assist hospitals during emergency situations. . Identify gaps between drugs on hand and goal.\n【309】 4. Identify potential sources of drugs in the community besides prehospital and hospital supplies (e.g., locally developed stockpiles, community pharmacies, drug wholesalers/ warehouses, physicians' offices via medical society). Identifying additional sources should include daily, routine needs of the community.\n【310】 5. Develop relationships with leadership from additional sources; ask for \"snapshot\" inventory of drugs, and establish \"mutual aid\" agreements to rapidly acquire drugs.\n【311】 6. Assess drugs available in the community by adding prehospital + hospital + community pharmacies + drug wholesalers/warehouses + physicians' offices (through medical society).\n【312】 7. If the drug supply is low, develop a plan for intercommunity mutual aid or rationing.\n【313】 8. Develop a plan to rapidly acquire drugs from additional sources and deliver products to points of care. This plan should include communications between point(s) of care and additional sources, mutual aid agreements with additional community sources, transport of drugs, and reimbursement.\n【314】 # EVALUATION\n【315】 1. Plan, conduct, and evaluate a community-wide drill. The evaluation should include measuring quantity and names of drugs and pharmaceutical supplies acquired, distributed and administered; times when drill started, time drugs were acquired from distribution points, duration of transport, time of distribution to points of care, and time of administration to patients.\n【316】 2. Refine plan based on drill experience.\n【317】 - Develop criteria and policy to discharge patients who can go home or be quickly transferred to long-term care.\n【318】 -Make sure each department has a procedure for mass casualty care. These procedures need to be reviewed and be accessible to the command center. -Departments need to determine procedures for what will be done immediately (0-120 minutes), intermediately (2-4 hours) and long term (4-24 hours). - Notify all departments of incident and of emergency plan activation.\n【319】 - Request that policies be approved by a centralized committee that oversees the emergency operations and plan.\n【320】 - Update call lists. Every department should have a current list that identifies staff by their proximity to the hospital.\n【321】 - Make staff aware of where to park, where to report, how to respond, etc.\n【322】 - Maintain a centralized data base with staff competency skills like ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support), TNCC (Trauma Nurse Core Course), ENPC (Emergency Nurse Pediatric Course), and PALS. Identify who is competent to care for critically ill patients.\n【323】 - Add on-call staff to the disaster call list.\n【324】 - Maintain names of retired or unemployed staff in a hospital or health system database.\n【325】 - Include Medical Reserve Corp information/lists in the emergency response plan.\n【326】 - Prepare badges in advance for credentialed professional staff.\n【327】 - Credential volunteers in advance. Community agencies typically manage volunteers.\n【328】 - Set up a system so that the hospital can verify credentials (i.e., State ESAR-VHP).\n【329】 - Ensure that staff is assigned to tasks with which they are most familiar and perform daily; do not change routine procedures.\n【330】 # EVALUATION\n【331】 Hospitals/health systems should plan and execute a drill with EMS at least once a year. The drill should include objectives to accommodate 00 patients with beds, staffing, and resources.\n【332】 Critique the completed drill, write a report, and share the findings with participants. Hospital administrators should analyze the report and make recommendations to the disaster plan. Any deficiencies should be tested in the next drill.\n【333】 Planning a drill is expensive. Exercises must be done in conjunction with state or county/ city emergency management agency staff with the resources to conduct them.\n【334】 Worldwide bombings occur almost daily and are escalating in complexity and sophistication. As noted throughout this report, we know the U.S. health care system will be overwhelmed by a terrorist bombing. The proposed solutions outlined in this report, provide strategies that can be put in place now-before a crisis strikes-to address the system wide and discipline-specific surge capacity challenges to providing an effective response.\n", "seq_id": 157, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少序号#214#214#少序号\n缺少序号#220#220#少序号\n缺少序号#245#245#少序号\n缺少序号#256#256#少序号\n缺少序号#259#259#少序号\n缺少序号#261#261#少序号\n序号错误#309#313#结合上文序号错误", "type3": "无关文本#10#10#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#21#21#最后一个 6与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 22:24:43"}

They will eat a small bit of something and wait, and if they don't get sick, they continue.  An effective rodenticide must be tasteless and odorless in lethal concentrations, and have a delayed effect.\n【4】 # Poisonous chemicals\n【5】 ## Anticoagulants\n【6】 Anticoagulants are defined as chronic (death occurs after 1 - 2 weeks post ingestion of the lethal dose, rarely sooner), single-dose (second generation) or multiple dose (first generation) cumulative rodenticides. Fatal internal bleeding is caused by lethal dose of anticoagulants such as brodifacoum, coumatetralyl or warfarin. These substances, in effective doses are antivitamins K, blocking the enzymes K1-2,3-epoxide-reductase (this enzyme is preferentially blocked by 4-hydroxycoumarin/4-hydroxythiacoumarin derivatives) and K1-quinone-reductase (this enzyme is preferentially blocked by indandione derivatives), depriving the organism of its source of active vitamin K1. This leads to disruption of the vitamin K cycle, resulting in inability of production of essential blood-clotting factors (mainly coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor) and X (Stuart factor)).\n【7】 In addition to this specific metabolic disruption, toxic doses of 4-hydroxycoumarin/4-hydroxythiacoumarin and indandione anticoagulants cause damage to tiny blood vessels (capillaries), increasing their permeability, causing diffuse internal bleedings (haemorrhagias). These effects are gradual, they develop in course of days and are not accompanied by any nociceptive perceptions, such as pain or agony. In final phase of the intoxication, the exhausted rodent collapses in hypovolemic circulatory shock or severe anemia and dies calmly. Rodenticidal anticoagulants are either first generation agents (4-hydroxycoumarin type: warfarin, coumatetralyl; indandione type: pindone, diphacinone, chlorophacinone), generally requiring higher concentrations (usually between 0.005 and 0.1%), consecutive intake over days in order to accumulate the lethal dose, poor active or inactive after single feeding and less toxic than second generation agents, which are derivatives of 4-hydroxycoumarin (difenacoum, brodifacoum, bromadiolone and flocoumafen) or 4-hydroxy-1-benzothiin-2-one (4-hydroxy-1-thiacoumarin, sometimes incorrectly referred to as 4-hydroxy-1-thiocoumarin, for reason see heterocyclic compounds), namely difethialone.\n【8】 Second generation agents are far more toxic than first generation, they are generally applied in lower concentrations in baits (usually in order 0.001 - 0.005%), are lethal after single ingestion of bait and are effective  against strains of rodents that became resistant against first generation anticoagulants; thus, the second generation anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as \"superwarfarins\".\n【9】 Sometimes, anticoagulant rodenticides are potentiated by an antibiotic, most common the sulfaquinoxaline. The aim of this association (e.g. warfarin 0.05% + sulfaquinoxaline 0.02%, or difenacoum 0.005% + sulfaquinoxaline 0.02% etc.) is, that the antibiotic/bacteriostatic agent suppresses intestinal/gut symbiotic microflora, that represents a source of vitamin K. Thus, the symbiotic bacterias are killed, or their metabolism is impaired and the production of vitamin K by them is diminuted, an effect, which logically contributes to the action of anticoagulants. Antibiotic agents other than sulfaquinoxaline may be used, f.e. co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, neomycin or metronidazole.\n【10】 Further synergism used in rodenticidal baits is that of an association of an anticoagulant with a compound with vitamin D-activity, i.e. cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, see below. Typical formulas used are f.e. warfarin 0.025 - 0.05% + cholecalciferol 0.01%.\n【11】 In some lands, there are even fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e. anticoagulant + antibiotic + vitamin D, f.e. difenacoum 0.005% + sulfaquinoxaline 0.02% + cholecalciferol 0.01%.\n【12】 Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025 - 0.005% are so toxic, that no known resistant strains of rodents exists, and even rodents resistant against other derivatives are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.\n【13】 Vitamin K1 has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for pets or humans accidentally or intentionally (poison assaults on pets, suicidal attempts) exposed to anticoagulant poisons.  In addition, since some of these poisons act by inhibiting liver functions and in progressed stage of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors as well as the whole volume of circulating blood lacks, a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who inadvertently takes them, an advantage over some older poisons.\n【14】 The main benefit of anticoagulants is the time taken for the poison to induce death means that the rats do not associate death with eating the poison. In fact the rat will often die from being bitten by a fellow rat, which can lead to the offending rodent to be outcast from the group.\n【15】 ## Metal phosphides\n【16】 Metal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1-3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually zinc phosphide) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are  cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents, that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2-4 days). These methods of alterning rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).\n【17】 Zinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in amount of around 0.75-2%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor characteristic for phosphine liberated by hydrolysis. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repulse) rodents, but has repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds(notably wild turkeys) are not sensitive to the smell, and will feed on the bait, and thus become collateral damage.\n【18】 The tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phopsphide for fumigation/gassing) may  contain other chemicals which evolve ammonia which helps to reduce the potential for spontaneous ignition or explosion of the phosphine gas.\n【19】 Phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, therefore the risk of secondary poisoning is low.\n【20】 Before the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During the World War II, they came in use in United States because of shortage of strychnine due to the Japanese occupation of the territories, where strychnine-producing plants are grown (Strychnos nux-vomica, in south-east Asia). Phosphides are rather fast acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas instead of in the affected buildings.\n【21】 Phosphides used as rodenticides are:\n【22】 - aluminium phosphide (fumigant only)\n【23】 - calcium phosphide  (fumigant only)\n【24】 - magnesium phosphide (fumigant only)\n【25】 - zinc phosphide (in baits)\n【26】 ## Hypercalcemia\n【27】 Calciferols (vitamins D), cholecalciferol (vitamin D and ergocalciferol (vitamin D are used as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are beneficial to mammals: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a miligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, +), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocard is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, or cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait), sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% ergocalciferol when used alone. There is an important feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicants, that means, that mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect can be achieved by a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait, and vice-versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concetration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive, than effective concentrations of the most anticoagulants. The historically very first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in fact the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D) back in early 1970s, containing warfarin 0.025% + ergocalciferol 0.1%. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum + 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either calciferols 0.075 - 0.1% (f.e. Quintox, containing 0.075% cholecalciferol) alone, or a combination of calciferol 0.01 - 0.075% with an anticoagulant are marketed.\n【28】 In family pets, accidental ingestion is generally considered safe for cats but dangerous for dogs. Additional anticoagulant renders the bait more toxic to pets as well as human. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants (zinc phosphide, bromethalin, f.e.). Specific antidote for calciferol intoxication is calcitonin, a hormone, that lowers the blood levels of calcium. The therapy with commercially available calcitonin preparations is, however, expensive.\n【29】 ## Other\n【30】 Other chemical poisons inclu\n【31】 - ANTU (α-naphtylthiourea; specific against Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus)\n【32】 - Arsenic\n【33】 - Barium (a toxic metal) compound\n【34】 Barium carbonate\n【35】 - Barium carbonate\n【36】 - Bromethalin (which affects the nervous system, no antidote)\n【37】 - Chloralose (narcotic acting condensation product of chloral and glucose)\n【38】 - Crimidine (2-chloro-N, N,6-trimethylpyrimidin-4-amine; a synthetic convulsant poison, antivitamin B\n【39】 - 1,3-Difluoro-2-propanol (\"Gliftor\" in the former USSR)\n【40】 - Endrin (organochlorine cyclodiene insecticide, used in the past for extermination of voles in fields during winter by aircraft spraying)\n【41】 - Fluoroacetamide (\"1081\")\n【42】 - Phosacetim (a delayed-action organophosphorous rodenticide)\n【43】 - White phosphorus\n【44】 - Pyrinuron (an urea derivative)\n【45】 - Scilliroside\n【46】 - Sodium fluoroacetate (\"1080\")\n【47】 - Strychnine\n【48】 - Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (\"tetramine\")\n【49】 - Thallium (a toxic heavy metal) compounds\n【50】 - Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide absorbed in an inert carrier)\n【51】 # Alternatives\n【52】 Mechanical rat traps are one possible alternative to poisons; another alternative is to have a dog. Both of these methods have a disadvantage of being comparatively messy, a particular problem when the building with a rat problem is to be uninhabited for some months.  Anticoagulants have the advantage that their first effect is dehydration from blood loss, causing the unfortunate rodent to leave the building in search of water. Another alternative is the use of biological, non-toxic, yet lethal baits, consisting of anhydrous powdered maize/corn cobs, containing high fractions (over 40%) of α-cellulose, which is incorporated into a solid, gastric-resistant matrix, that is dissolved in the gut. The α-cellulose anhydrous powder released in the gut of the rodent disrupts water and electrolyte balance and so kills the rodent. This material is commonly formulated with taste and flavour additives to increase its palatability, and is compressed into granulate of appropriate size (granules of bigger size for rats, smaller granules for mice). This material is completely non-toxic, leaves no harmful residues, is environmentally friendly and accidental ingestion of it by pets or children is simply treated by giving laxatives, plenty of water and electrolytes. Dead rodents killed by this mean pose no risk of secondary poisoning.\n【53】 Newer rodenticides have been developed to work with by reducing the sperm count in males to deprive them of the ability to procreate rather than to kill rodents outright. They are usually administered in the breeding seasons of most rodents.\n", "seq_id": 26708, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-17 19:43:33"}

In 2004, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended low dose aspirin as a primary preventive strategy in men aged 45 to 79 years and in women age 55 to 79 years, irrespective of the presence of diabetes. The safety and efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes remains controversial.\n【3】 # Primary Prevention with Aspirin\n【4】 In one prospective, randomized, multicenter, blinded trial, 2,539 type 2 diabetes patients with no history of atherosclerotic events were followed for a median of 4.4 years were randomized to either  low-dose aspirin (81 or 100 mg per day) or placebo control. There was no difference in the risk of fatal or nonfatal ischemic heart disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral arterial disease:\n【5】 13.6 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group vs 17.0 per 1000 person-years in the non-aspirin group, hazard ratio , 0.80; 95% confidence interval , 0.58-1.10; log-rank test, P = ..

Common adverse reactions include diarrhea, weight loss, nausea, headache, back pain, influenza, insomnia, dizziness and decreased appetite.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 # Indications\n【8】 - Roflumilast is indicated as a treatment to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations.\n【9】 Limitations of Use\n【10】 - Roflumilast is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\n【11】 # Dosage\n【12】 - The recommended dose of roflumilast is one 500 microgram (mcg) tablet per day, with or without food.\n【13】 # Dosage Forms And Strengths\n【14】 - Roflumilast is supplied as white to off-white, round tablets, embossed with “D” on one side and “500” on the other side. Each tablet contains 500 mcg of roflumilast.\n【15】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【16】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【17】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Roflumilast in adult patients.\n【18】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【19】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Roflumilast in adult patients.\n【20】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【21】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【22】 There is limited information regarding Roflumilast FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【23】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【24】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【25】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Roflumilast in pediatric patients.\n【26】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【27】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Roflumilast in pediatric patients.\n【28】 # Contraindications\n【29】 The use of DALIRESP is contraindicated in the following condition:\n【30】 Moderate to severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)\n【31】 # Warnings\n【32】 Treatment of Acute Bronchospasm\n【33】 - Roflumilast is not a bronchodilator and should not be used for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\n【34】 Psychiatric Events including Suicidality\n【35】 - Treatment with roflumilast is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In 8 controlled clinical trials 5.9%  of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3%  treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with roflumilast 500 mcg daily (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for roflumilast versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively). Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving roflumilast compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression.\n【36】 - Before using roflumilast in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with roflumilast in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with roflumilast if such events occur.\n【37】 Weight Decrease\n【38】 - Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in roflumilast clinical trials and was reported in 7.5%  of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1%  treated with placebo. In addition to being reported as adverse reactions, weight was prospectively assessed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration. In these studies, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5-10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo. In addition, 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (>10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving roflumilast. Patients treated with roflumilast should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of roflumilast should be considered.\n【39】 Drug Interactions\n【40】 - A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure, which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of roflumilast. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with roflumilast is not recommended\n【41】 # Adverse Reactions\n【42】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【43】 - The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections:\n【44】 - Psychiatric Events Including Suicidality.\n【45】 - Weight Decrease.\n【46】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n【47】 - The safety data described below reflect exposure of 4438 patients to roflumilast 500 mcg once daily in four 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 6-month placebo-controlled trials, and two 6-month drug add-on trials. In these trials, 3136 and 1232 COPD patients were exposed to roflumilast 500 mcg once daily for 6 months and 1-year, respectively.\n【48】 - The population had a median age of 64 years (range 40-, 73% were male, 92.9% were Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV of 8.9 to 89.1% predicted. In these trials, 68.5% of the patients treated with roflumilast reported an adverse reaction compared with 65.3% treated with placebo.\n【49】 - The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reaction was 14.8% for roflumilast-treated patients and 9.9% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of roflumilast were diarrhea (2.4%) and nausea (1.6%).\n【50】 - Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, which occurred more frequently in roflumilast-treated patients include diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, prostate cancer,  acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.\n【51】 TABLE 1 summarizes the adverse reactions reported by ≥ 2% of patients in the roflumilast group in 8 controlled COPD clinical trials.\n【52】 - Adverse reactions that occurred in the roflumilast group at a frequency of 1 to 2% where rates exceeded that in the placebo group inclu\n【53】 Gastrointestinal disorders - abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastritis, vomiting\n【54】 Infections and infestations - rhinitis , sinusitis,  urinary tract infection,\n【55】 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders - muscle spasms\n【56】 Nervous system disorders - tremor\n【57】 Psychiatric disorders - anxiety, depression\n【58】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【59】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of roflumilast received worldwide and have not been listed elsewhere. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting or potential causal connection to roflumilast. Because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to roflumilast exposure: hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, and rash.\n【60】 # Drug Interactions\n【61】 A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 .\n【62】 Drugs That Induce Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes\n【63】 Strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers decrease systemic exposure to roflumilast and may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of roflumilast. Therefore the use of strong cytochrome P450 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) with roflumilast is not recommended.\n【64】 Drugs That Inhibit Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes\n【65】 The co-administration of roflumilast (500 mcg) with CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors that inhibit both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 simultaneously (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, enoxacin, cimetidine) may increase roflumilast systemic exposure and may result in increased adverse reactions. The risk of such concurrent use should be weighed carefully against benefit .\n【66】 Oral Contraceptives Containing Gestodene and Ethinyl Estradiol\n【67】 The co-administration of roflumilast (500 mcg) with oral contraceptives containing gestodene and ethinyl estradiol may increase roflumilast systemic exposure and may result in increased side effects. The risk of such concurrent use should be weighed carefully against benefit.\n【68】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【69】 ### Pregnancy\n【70】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【71】 - Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well controlled studies of roflumilast in pregnant women. roflumilast was not teratogenic in mice, rats, or rabbits. Roflumilast should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n【72】 - Roflumilast induced stillbirth and decreased pup viability in mice at doses corresponding to approximately 16 and 49 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (on a mg/m2 basis at maternal doses > 2 mg/kg/day and 6 mg/kg/day, respectively). Roflumilast induced post-implantation loss in rats at doses greater than or equal to approximately 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis at maternal doses ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day). No treatment-related effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in mice, rats, and rabbits at approximately 12, 3, and 26 times the MRHD, respectively (on a mg/m2 basis at maternal doses of 1.5, 0.2, and 0.8 mg/kg/day, respectively).\n【73】 - Nonteratogenic effects: Roflumilast has been shown to adversely affect pup post-natal development when dams were treated with the drug during pregnancy and lactation periods in mice. These studies found that roflumilast decreased pup rearing frequencies at approximately 49 times the MRHD (on a mg/mg2 basis at a maternal dose of 6 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy and lactation. Roflumilast  decreased survival and forelimb grip reflex and delayed pinna detachment in mouse pups at approximately 97 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of 12 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy and lactation.\n【74】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【75】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Roflumilast in women who are pregnant.\n【76】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【77】 - Roflumilast should not be used during labor and delivery. There are no human studies that have investigated effects of roflumilast on preterm labor or labor at term; however, animal studies showed that roflumilast disrupted the labor and delivery process in mice. roflumilast induced delivery retardation in pregnant mice at doses greater than or equal to approximately 16 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of > 2 mg/kg/day).\n【78】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【79】 - Roflumilast and/or its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Excretion of roflumilast and/or its metabolites into human milk is probable. There are no human studies that have investigated effects of roflumilast on breast-fed infants. Roflumilast should not be used by women who are nursing.\n【80】 ### Pediatric Use\n【81】 - COPD does not normally occur in children. The safety and effectiveness of roflumilast in pediatric patients have not been established.\n【82】 ### Geriatic Use\n【83】 - Of the 4438 COPD subjects exposed to roflumilast for up to 12 months in 8 controlled clinical trials, 2022 were > 65 years of age and 471 were > 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Based on available data for roflumilast, no adjustment of dosage in geriatric patients is warranted.\n【84】 ### Gender\n【85】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Roflumilast with respect to specific gender populations.\n【86】 ### Race\n【87】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Roflumilast with respect to specific racial populations.\n【88】 ### Renal Impairment\n【89】 - In twelve subjects with severe renal impairment administered a single dose of 500 mcg roflumilast, the AUCs of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were decreased by 21% and 7%, respectively and Cmax were reduced by 16% and 12%, respectively. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.\n【90】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【91】 - Roflumilast 250 mcg once daily for 14 days was studied in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A and B (8 subjects in each group). The AUCs of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were increased by 51% and 24%, respectively in Child-Pugh A subjects and by 92% and 41%, respectively in Child-Pugh B subjects, as compared to age-, weight- and gender-matched healthy subjects. The Cmax of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were increased by 3% and 26%, respectively in Child-Pugh A subjects and by 26% and 40%, respectively in Child-Pugh B subjects, as compared to healthy subjects. Roflumilast 500 mcg has not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. Clinicians should consider the risk-benefit of administering roflumilast to patients who have mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A). Roflumilast is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) .\n【92】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【93】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Roflumilast in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【94】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【95】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Roflumilast in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【96】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【97】 ### Administration\n【98】 - Oral\n【99】 ### Monitoring\n【100】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Roflumilast in the drug label.\n【101】 # IV Compatibility\n【102】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Roflumilast in the drug label.\n【103】 # Overdosage\n【104】 Human Experience\n【105】 No case of overdose has been reported in clinical studies with roflumilast. During the Phase I studies of roflumilast, the following symptoms were observed at an increased rate after a single oral dose of 2500 mcg and a single dose of 5000 mcg: headache, gastrointestinal disorders, dizziness, palpitations, lightheadedness, clamminess and arterial hypotension.\n【106】 Management of Overdose\n【107】 In case of overdose, patients should seek immediate medical help. Appropriate supportive medical care should be provided. Since roflumilast is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of drug removal. It is not known whether roflumilast is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.\n【108】 # Pharmacology\n【109】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【110】 - Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE. Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme in lung tissue) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. While the specific mechanism(s) by which roflumilast exerts its therapeutic action in COPD patients is not well defined, it is thought to be related to the effects of increased intracellular cyclic AMP in lung cells.\n【111】 ## Structure\n【112】 - The active ingredient in roflumilast tablets is roflumilast. Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE inhibitors. The chemical name of roflumilast is N--3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-benzamide. Its empirical formula is C17H14Cl2F2N2O3 and the molecular weight is 403.22.\n【113】 - The chemical structure is:\n【114】 - The drug substance is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic powder with a melting point of 160°C. It is practically insoluble in water and hexane, sparingly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in acetone.\n【115】 - Roflumilast is supplied as white to off-white, round tablets, embossed with “D” on one side and “500” on the other side. Each tablet contains 500 mcg of roflumilast.\n【116】 - Each tablet of roflumilast for oral administration contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, corn starch, povidone and magnesium stearate.\n【117】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【118】 - In COPD patients, 4 week treatment with roflumilast 500 mcg oral once daily reduced sputum neutrophils and eosinophils by 31%, and 42%, respectively. In a pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers, roflumilast 500 mcg once daily reduced the number of total cells, neutrophils and eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following segmental pulmonary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge by 35%, 38% and 73%, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n【119】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【120】 Absorption\n【121】 - The absolute bioavailability of roflumilast following a 500 mcg oral dose is approximately 80%. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of roflumilast typically occur approximately one hour after dosing (ranging from 0.5 to 2 hours) in the fasted state while plateau-like maximum concentrations of the N-oxide metabolite are reached in approximately eight hours (ranging from 4 to 13 hours). Food has no effect on total drug absorption, but delays time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of roflumilast by one hour and reduces Cmax by approximately 40%, however, Cmax and Tmax of roflumilast N-oxide are unaffected. An in vitro study showed that roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide did not inhibit P-gp transporter.\n【122】 Distribution\n【123】 - Plasma protein binding of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite is approximately 99% and 97%, respectively. Volume of distribution for single dose 500 mcg roflumilast is about 2.9 L/kg. Studies in rats with radiolabeled roflumilast indicate low penetration across the blood-brain barrier.\n【124】 Metabolism\n【125】 - Roflumilast is extensively metabolized via Phase I (cytochrome P and Phase II (conjugation) reactions. The N-oxide metabolite is the only major metabolite observed in the plasma of humans. Together, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide account for the majority (87.5%) of total dose administered in plasma. In urine, roflumilast was not detectable while roflumilast N-oxide was only a trace metabolite (less than 1%). Other conjugated metabolites such as roflumilast N-oxide glucuronide and 4-amino-3,5-dichloropyridine N-oxide were detected in urine.\n【126】 - While roflumilast is three times more potent than roflumilast N-oxide at inhibition of the PDE4 enzyme in vitro, the plasma AUC of roflumilast N-oxide on average is about 10-fold greater than the plasma AUC of roflumilast.\n【127】 - In vitro studies and clinical drug-drug interaction studies suggest that the biotransformation of roflumilast to its N-oxide metabolite is mediated by CYP 1A2 and 3A4. Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide do not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, or 4A9/11. Therefore, there is a low probability of relevant interactions with substances metabolized by these P450 enzymes. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated no induction of the CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4/5 and only a weak induction of CYP 2B6 by roflumilast.\n【128】 Elimination\n【129】 - The plasma clearance after short-term intravenous infusion of roflumilast is on average about 9.6 L/h. Following an oral dose, the median plasma effective half-life of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are approximately 17 and 30 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are reached after approximately 4 days for roflumilast and 6 days for roflumilast N-oxide following once daily dosing. Following intravenous or oral administration of radiolabeled roflumilast, about 70% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine.\n【130】 Special Populations\n【131】 Hepatic Impairment\n【132】 - Roflumilast 250 mcg once daily for 14 days was studied in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A and B (8 subjects in each group). The AUC of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were increased by 51% and 24%, respectively in Child-Pugh A subjects and by 92% and 41%, respectively in Child-Pugh B subjects, as compared to age-, weight- and gender-matched healthy subjects. The Cmax of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were increased by 3% and 26%, respectively in Child-Pugh A subjects and by 26% and 40%, respectively in Child-Pugh B subjects, as compared to healthy subjects. Roflumilast 500 mcg has not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. Clinicians should consider the risk-benefit of administering roflumilast to patients who have mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A). roflumilast is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n【133】 Renal Impairment\n【134】 - In twelve subjects with severe renal impairment administered a single dose of 500 mcg roflumilast, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide AUCs were decreased by 21% and 7%, respectively and Cmax were reduced by 16% and 12%, respectively. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.\n【135】 Age\n【136】 - Roflumilast 500 mcg once daily for 15 days was studied in young, middle aged, and elderly healthy subjects. The exposure in elderly (> 65 years of age) were 27% higher in AUC and 16% higher in Cmax for roflumilast and 19% higher in AUC and 13% higher in Cmax for roflumilast-N-oxide than that in young volunteers (18-45 years old). No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\n【137】 Gender\n【138】 - In a Phase I study evaluating the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide, a 39% and 33% increase in roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide AUC were noted in healthy female subjects as compared to healthy male subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender.\n【139】 Smoking\n【140】 - The pharmacokinetics of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were comparable in smokers as compared to non-smokers. There was no difference in Cmax between smokers and non-smokers when roflumilast 500 mcg was administered as a single dose to 12 smokers and 12 non-smokers. The AUC of roflumilast in smokers was 13% less than that in non-smokers while the AUC of roflumilast N-oxide in smokers was 17% more than that in non-smokers.\n【141】 Race\n【142】 - As compared to Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, and Japanese showed 16%, 41%, and 15% higher AUC, respectively, for roflumilast and 43%, 27%, and 16% higher AUC, respectively, for roflumilast N-oxide. As compared to Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, and Japanese showed 8%, 21%, and 5% higher Cmax, respectively, for roflumilast and 43%, 27%, and 17% higher Cmax, respectively, for roflumilast N-oxide. No dosage adjustment is necessary for race.\n【143】 Drug Interactions\n【144】 - Drug interaction studies were performed with roflumilast and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction . No significant drug interactions were observed when 500 mcg oral roflumilast was administered with inhaled salbutamol, formoterol, budesonide and oral montelukast, digoxin, theophylline, warfarin, sildenafil, midazolam, or antacids.\n【145】 - The effect of concomitant drugs on the exposure of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide is shown below.\n【146】 - Effect of concomitant drugs on the exposure of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. Note that the dashed lines indicate the lower and higher bounds (0.8-1. of the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio of Cmax or AUC for roflumilast or roflumilast N-oxide for Treatment (DALIRESP+Coadministered Drug) vs. Reference (DALIRESP). The dosing regimens of coadministered drugs was: Midazolam:2mg po SD; Erythromycin:500mg po TID; Ketoconazole:200mg po BID; Rifampicin:600mg po QD; Fluvoxamine:50mg po QD; Digoxin:250ug po SD; Maalox:30mL po SD; Salbutamol:0.2mg pi TID; Cimetidine:400mg po BID; Formoterol:40ug po BID; Budesoni\n【147】 - Drug interactions considered to be significant are described in more detail below.\n【148】 Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2:\n【149】 - Erythromycin: In an open-label crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, the coadministration of CYP 3A4 inhibitor erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 13 days) with a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast resulted in 40% and 70% increase in Cmax and AUC for roflumilast, respectively, and a 34% decrease and a 4% increase in Cmax and AUC for roflumilast N-oxide, respectively.\n【150】 - Ketoconazole: In an open-label crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, the coadministration of a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 13 days) with a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast resulted in 23% and 99% increase in Cmax and AUC for roflumilast, respectively, and a 38% reduction and 3% increase in Cmax and AUC for roflumilast N-oxide, respectively.\n【151】 - Fluvoxamine: In an open-label crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, the coadministration of dual CYP 3A4/1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine (50 mg daily for 14 days) with a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast showed a 12% and 156% increase in roflumilast Cmax and AUC along with a 210% decrease and 52% increase in roflumilast N-oxide Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n【152】 - Enoxacin: In an open-label crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, the coadministration of dual CYP 3A4/1A2 inhibitor enoxacin (400 mg twice daily for 12 days) with a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast resulted in an increased Cmax and AUC of roflumilast by 20% and 56%, respectively. Roflumilast N-oxide Cmax was decreased by 14% while roflumilast N-oxide AUC was increased by 23%.\n【153】 - Cimetidine: In an open-label crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, the coadministration of a dual CYP 3A4/1A2 inhibitor cimetidine (400 mg twice daily for 7 days) with a single dose of 500 mcg oral roflumilast resulted in a 46% and 85% increase in roflumilast Cmax and AUC; and a 4% decrease in Cmax and 27% increase in AUC for roflumilast N-oxide, respectively.\n【154】 Oral Contraceptives containing Gestodene and Ethinyl Estradiol'':\n【155】 - In an open-label crossover study in 20 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast with repeated doses of a fixed combination oral contraceptive containing 0.075 mg gestodene and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol to steady state caused a 38% increase and 12% decrease in Cmax of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide, respectively. Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide AUCs were increased by 51% and 14%, respectively.\n【156】 Inducers of CYP enzymes:\n【157】 - Rifampicin: In an open-label, three-period, fixed-sequence study in 15 healthy volunteers, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 11 days) with a single oral dose of 500 mcg roflumilast resulted in reduction of roflumilast Cmax and AUC by 68% and 79%, respectively; and an increase of roflumilast N-oxide Cmax by 30% and reduced roflumilast N-oxide AUC by 56%.\n【158】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【159】 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【160】 - Long-term studies were conducted in hamsters and mice with roflumilast to evaluate its carcinogenic potential. In 2-year oral gavage carcinogenicity studies, roflumilast treatment resulted in dose-related, statistically significant increases in the incidence of undifferentiated carcinomas of nasal epithelium in hamsters at ≥ 8 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites). The tumorigenicity of roflumilast appears to be attributed to a reactive metabolite of 4-amino-3,5-dichloro-pyridine N-oxide (ADCP N-oxide). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice at roflumilast oral doses up to 12 and 18 mg/kg/day in females and males, respectively (approximately 10 and 15 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites).\n【161】 - Roflumilast tested positive in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test, but negative in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes, in vitro HPRT test with V79 cells, an in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells, DNA adduct formation assay in rat nasal mucosa, liver and testes, and in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosome aberration assay. Roflumilast N-oxide was negative in the Ames test and in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells.\n【162】 - In a human spermatogenesis study, roflumilast 500 mcg had no effects on semen parameters or reproductive hormones during the 3-month treatment period and the following 3-month off-treatment period. In a fertility study, roflumilast decreased fertility rates in male rats at 1.8-mg/kg/day (approximately 29 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). These rats  showed increases in the incidence of tubular atrophy, degeneration in the testis and spermiogenic granuloma in the epididymides. No effect on male rat fertility rate or reproductive organ morphology was observed at 0.8 mg/kg/day (approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). No effect on female fertility was observed up to the highest roflumilast dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\n【163】 # Clinical Studies\n【164】 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n【165】 - The efficacy and safety of roflumilast (roflumilast) in COPD was evaluated in 8 randomized double-blind, controlled, parallel group clinical trials in 9394 adult patients (4425 receiving roflumilast 500 mcg) 40 years of age and older with COPD. Of the 8 trials, two were placebo-controlled dose selection trials (Trials 1 and  of 6 months duration that evaluated the efficacy of roflumilast 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily, four were placebo-controlled 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and  primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of roflumilast on COPD exacerbations, and two were 6-month efficacy trials (Trials 7 and  which assessed the effect of roflumilast as add-on therapy to a long-acting beta agonist or long-acting anti-muscarinic. The 8 trials enrolled patients with nonreversible obstructive lung disease (FEV1/FVC ≤ 70% and ≤ 12% or 200 mL improvement in FEV1 in response to 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol) but the severity of airflow obstruction at baseline was different among the trials. Patients enrolled in the dose selection trials had the full range of COPD severity (FEV1 30-80% predicted); median age of 63 years, 73% male, and 99% Caucasian. Patients enrolled in the four exacerbation trials had severe COPD (FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted); median age of 64 years, 74% male, and 90% Caucasian. Patients enrolled in the two 6-month efficacy trials had moderate to severe COPD (FEV1 40-70% predicted); median age of 65 years, 68% male, and 97% Caucasian. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials, lung function (FEV alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure.\n【166】 - The two 6-month dose-selection efficacy trials (Trials 1 and  explored doses of 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily in a total of 1929 patients (751 and 724 on roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg, respectively). The selection of the 500 mcg dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (FEV over the 250 mcg dose. The once daily dosing regimen was primarily based on the determination of a plasma half-life of 17 hours for roflumilast and 30 hours for its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide.\n【167】 'Effect on Exacerbations'\n【168】 - The effect of roflumilast 500 mcg once daily on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in four 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and .\n【169】 - Two of the trials (Trials 3 and  conducted initially enrolled a population of patients with severe COPD (FEV1 ≤ 50% of predicted) inclusive of those with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema who had a history of smoking of at least 10 pack years. Inhaled corticosteroids were allowed as concomitant medications and used in 61% of both roflumilast and placebo-treated patients and short-acting beta agonists were allowed as rescue therapy. The use of long-acting beta agonists, long-acting anti-muscarinics, and theophylline were prohibited. The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations was a co-primary endpoint in both trials. There was not a symptomatic definition of exacerbation in these 2 trials. Exacerbations were defined in terms of severity requiring treatment with a moderate exacerbation defined as treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids in Trial 3 or systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics in Trial 4 and a severe exacerbation defined as requiring hospitalizations and/or leading to death in Trial 3 or requiring hospitalization in Trial 4. The trials randomized 1176 patients (567 on roflumilast) in Trial 3 and 1514 patients (760 on roflumilast) in Trial 4. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations.\n【170】 - Exploratory analyses of the results of Trials 3 and 4 identified a subpopulation of patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations within the previous year that appeared to demonstrate a better response in the reduction of the rate of COPD exacerbations compared to the overall population. As a result, two subsequent trials (Trial 5 and Trial  were conducted that enrolled patients with severe COPD but associated with chronic bronchitis, at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year, and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. In these trials, long-acting beta agonists and short-acting anti-muscarinics were allowed and were used by 44% and 35% of patients treated with roflumilast and 45% and 37% of patients treated with placebo, respectively. The use of inhaled corticosteroids was prohibited. As in trials 3 and 4, the rate of moderate exacerbations (defined as requiring intervention with systemic glucocorticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (defined as leading to hospitalization and/or to death) was a co-primary endpoint.\n【171】 - Trial 5 randomized a total of 1525 patients (765 on roflumilast) and Trial 6 randomized a total of 1571 patients (772 on roflumilast). In both trials, roflumilast 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo (TABLE . These two trials provide the evidence to support the use of roflumilast for the reduction of COPD exacerbations.\n【172】 - For patients in Trials 5 and 6 who received concomitant long-acting beta agonists or short-acting anti-muscarinics, reduction of moderate or severe exacerbations with roflumilast was similar to that observed for the overall populations of the two trials.\n【173】 'Effect on Lung Function'\n【174】 - While roflumilast is not a bronchodilator, all 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and  evaluated the effect of roflumilast on lung function as determined by the difference in FEV1 between roflumilast and placebo-treated patients (pre-bronchodilator FEV1 measured prior to study drug administration in three of the trials and post-bronchodilator FEV1 measured 30 minutes after administration of 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol in one trial) as a co-primary endpoint. In each of these trials roflumilast 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 which averaged approximately 50 mL across the four trials. TABLE 3 shows FEV1 results from Trials 5 and 6 which had demonstrated a significant reduction in COPD exacerbations.\n【175】 - Lung function was  evaluated in two 6-month trials (Trials 7 and  to assess the effect of roflumilast when administered as add-on therapy to treatment with a long-acting beta agonist or a long-acting anti-muscarinic. These trials were conducted in a different population of COPD patients  from that for which efficacy in reduction of exacerbations has been demonstrated and provide safety support to the roflumilast COPD program.\n【176】 - No trials have been conducted to assess the effects of roflumilast on COPD exacerbations when added to a fixed-dose combination product containing a long-acting beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroid.\n【177】 # How Supplied\n【178】 - Roflumilast is supplied as white to off-white, round tablets, embossed with “D” on one side and “500” on the other side. Each tablet contains 500 mcg of roflumilast.\n【179】 - DALIRESP tablets are available:\n【180】 - Bottles of 30:                     NDC 0456-0095-30\n【181】 - Bottles of 90:                     NDC 0456-0095-90\n【182】 - 10X10 Unit Dose:            NDC 0456-0095-63\n【183】 ## Storage\n【184】 - Store DALIRESP 500 mcg tablets at 20° - 25°C (68° - 77°F); excursions permitted to 15° - 30°C (59° - 86°F). .\n【185】 # Images\n【186】 ## Drug Images\n【187】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【188】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【189】 Bronchospasm\n【190】 - Roflumilast is not a bronchodilator and should not be used for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\n【191】 Psychiatric Events including Suicidality\n【192】 - Treatment with roflumilast is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In clinical trials, 5.9%  of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3%  treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse events were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with roflumilast 500 mcg (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for roflumilast versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively). Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving roflumilast compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression.\n【193】 - Before using roflumilast in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with roflumilast in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with roflumilast if such events occur.\n【194】 Weight Decrease\n【195】 Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in roflumilast clinical trials and was reported in - - - 7.5%  of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1%  treated with placebo. In two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration in which weight was prospectively assessed, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5-10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo and 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (>10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving roflumilast. Patients treated with roflumilast should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of roflumilast should be considered .\n【196】 Drug Interactions\n【197】 - The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of roflumilast. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with roflumilast is not recommended.\n【198】 ## Medication Guide\n【199】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【200】 - Alcohol-Roflumilast interaction has not been established.

Zolpidem belongs to a class of medications called sedative-hypnotics. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.\n【3】 # How should this medicine be used\n【4】 Zolpidem comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed at bedtime. Zolpidem will work faster if it is not taken with a meal or immediately after a meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zolpidem exactly as directed.\n【5】 You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take zolpidem and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take zolpidem, and to stay in bed for 7-8 hours. Do not take zolpidem if you will be unable to remain asleep for 7-8 hours after taking the medication. If you get up too soon after taking zolpidem, you may experience memory problems.\n【6】 Swallow the extended release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n【7】 Your sleep problems should improve within 7-10 days after you start taking zolpidem. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time or if they get worse at any time during your treatment.\n【8】 Zolpidem should normally be taken for short periods of time. If you take zolpidem for 2 weeks or longer, zolpidem may not help you sleep as well as it did when you first began to take the medication. If you take zolpidem for a long time, you  may develop dependence ('addiction'; a need to continue taking the medication) on zolpidem. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking zolpidem for 2 weeks or longer. Do not take a larger dose of zolpidem, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.\n【9】 Do not stop taking zolpidem without talking to your doctor, especially if you have taken it for longer than 2 weeks. If you suddenly stop taking zolpidem, you may develop unpleasant feelings or you may experience more severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, shakiness, stomach and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, and rarely, seizures.\n【10】 You may have more difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep on the first night after you stop taking zolpidem than you did before you started taking the medication. This is normal and usually gets better without treatment after one or two nights.\n【11】 Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n【12】 # Other uses for this medicine\n【13】 This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n【14】 # What special precautions should I follow\n【15】 Before taking zolpidem\n【16】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to zolpidem or any other medications.\n【17】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as imipramine (Tofranil); itraconazole (Sporanox); medications for anxiety, colds or allergies, mental illness, pain, or seizures; rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); sedatives; sertraline (Zoloft);sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n【18】 - tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression; a problem with heavy snoring; sleep apnea (condition in which the patient briefly stops breathing many times during the night); other breathing problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema; myasthenia gravis (condition that causes weakness of certain muscles); or liver or kidney disease.\n【19】 - tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking zolpidem, call your doctor. Do not breastfeed while you are taking zolpidem.\n【20】 - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking zolpidem.\n【21】 - you should know that zolpidem may make you drowsy during the day, and may increase the risk that you will fall.

The initial approach involves a thorough history and physical examination. The most common presenting complaint is poor growth and failure to gain weight. Nutritional interventions such as regular breastfeeding, eating with the child, measuring the caloric requirement of the child or ensuring the child eats with an upright posture should be added to psychological interventions like parent education and maintaining a discord free family environment.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 Amidst rapidly rising infant and child death rates, Dr. Henry Dwight was the first to add a clean environment and constant supervision to the management strategy of failure to thrive patients. As time has progressed, red flags and the present strategy of nutritional rehabilitation followed by a vigilant and prolonged follow up period has been developed.\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 There is no established classification system for failure to thrive. Based on cause, it may be divided into organic and non-organic failure to thrive.\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 The most common cause of failure to thrive is inadequate calorie intake. This may be secondary to psychological causes, poor environmental status, poor calorie absorption and underlying medical conditions that cause excessive energy expenditure.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 Causes of failure to thrive are mainly organic and non-organic. Organic causes are further divided into inadequate calorie intake, inadequate calories absorption and increased calorie expenditure.\n【11】 # Differentiating Failure to thrive from Other Diseases\n【12】 It is important to differentiate failure to thrive into organic and non-organic causes. Furthermore, using the concepts of bone age, chronological age, catch up growth and catch down growth, conditions such as constitutional growth delay and familial short stature should  be considered.\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 The prevalence of failure to thrive depends on the development status of the country. Studies have suggested a prevalence rate of approximately 5% in the United States of America.\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 It is important to differentiate risk factors from causes. Major risk factors to be considered include an unsafe, dirty environment, history of parental psychiatric illness, substance abuse, marital conflict, low birth weight, chromosomal disorders and dental caries.\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 There are no established screening protocols established for failure to thrive.\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【20】 The most common presenting complaint is poor growth and failure to gain weight. The patient may have more specific complaints depending on the underlying cause. A few important complications include a diminished final weight and height, vitamin deficiencies and an increase risk of recurrence of failure to thrive. Not much data is available on the prognosis of failure to thrive as it is a multifactorial process. However, the duration of malnutrition is directly proportional to the cognitive and physical decline of the patient.\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\n【23】 There is no diagnostic study of choice for failure to thrive. Various definition such as weight for age less than the 5th percentile for age, weight for height less than the 5th percentile for age or a drop in more than two percentiles on the growth chart may be used. The initial approach involves a thorough history and physical examination. This will help narrow the diagnosis, identify red flags and then determine the need for hospitalization.\n【24】 ## History and Symptoms\n【25】 The most common presenting complaint is poor growth and failure to gain weight. The patient may have more specific complaints depending on the underlying cause. A few important complications include a diminished final weight and height, vitamin deficiencies and an increase risk of recurrence of failure to thrive. Not much data is available on the prognosis of failure to thrive as it is a multifactorial process. However, the duration of malnutrition is directly proportional to the cognitive and physical decline of the patient.\n【26】 ## Physical Examination\n【27】 The patient encounter provides a good opportunity to not only physically examine the patient, but to  notice the interaction between the parents and the child. Murmurs, structural deformities such as cleft lip or palate, crackles secondary to a cystic fibrosis related pneumonia or rashes secondary to physical abuse are some important positive findings. With proper technique, anthropometric measurements should be plotted and compared with previous measurements.\n【28】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【29】 Lab investigations are ordered based on the initial history and physical examination  may be ordered to uncover conditions such as iron deficiency anemia secondary to malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, renal failure or an underlying malignancy.\n【30】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【31】 There are no specific ECG findings associated with failure to thrive.\n【32】 ## X-ray\n【33】 X-rays are useful in diagnosing organic causes of failure to thrive. Listing down each organic cause is beyond the scope of this microchapter.\n【34】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\n【35】 Echocardiography and ultrasounds are useful in diagnosing organic causes of failure to thrive.\n【36】 ## CT scan\n【37】 CTs are useful in diagnosing organic causes of failure to thrive.\n【38】 ## MRI\n【39】 MRIs are useful in diagnosing organic causes of failure to thrive. Listing down each organic cause is beyond the scope of this microchapter.\n【40】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n【41】 Barium swallow may be helpful in the diagnosis of failure to thrive.\n【42】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n【43】 There are no other diagnostic studies associated with failure to thrive.\n【44】 # Treatment\n【45】 ## Medical Therapy\n【46】 Appetite stimulants such as cryptoheptadine and progesterones may be employed in patients with failure to thrive. However, these are not recommended. Medical therapy employed  depends on the underlying organic cause.\n【47】 ## Interventions\n【48】 Nutritional interventions such as regular breastfeeding, eating with the child, measuring the caloric requirement of the child or ensuring the child eats with an upright posture should be added to psychological interventions like parent education and maintaining a discord free family environment.\n【49】 ## Surgery\n【50】 Surgery may be employed for certain organic causes of failure to thrive such as a renal transplant, small intestinal bowel obstruction, thyroidectomy or closure devices placed for congenital heart diseases.\n【51】 ## Primary Prevention\n【52】 Regular anthropometric measurements added to an adequate, balanced diet and a healthy environment are some important primary preventive strategies.\n【53】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【54】 There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of failure to thrive.\n", "seq_id": 11677, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 00:21:15"}

The comments and responses to them can be seen at: /niosh/docket/archive/# F o r e w o r d\n【1】 The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91- was passed to assure safe and healthful working conditions for every working person and to preserve our hu man resources. This Act charges the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards and describing exposures that are safe for various periods of employment, including (but not limited to) the exposures at which no worker will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy because of his or her work experience.\n【2】 NIOSH issues Current Intelligence Bulletins (CIBs) to disseminate new scientific informa tion about occupational hazards. A CIB may draw attention to a formerly unrecognized hazard, report new data on a known hazard, or disseminate information about hazard con trol. CIBs are distributed to representatives of academia, industry, organized labor, public health agencies, and public interest groups, as well as to federal agencies responsible for ensuring the safety and health of workers.\n【3】 NIOSH is the leading federal agency conducting research and providing guidance on the occupational safety and health implications and applications of nanotechnology. As nano technology continues to expand into every industrial sector, workers will be at an increased risk of exposure to new nanomaterials. Today, nanomaterials are found in hundreds of products, ranging from cosmetics, to clothing, to industrial and biomedical applications. These nanoscale-based products are typically called \"first generation\" products of nano technology. Many of these nanoscale-based products are composed of engineered nanopar ticles, such as metal oxides, nanotubes, nanowires, quantum dots, and carbon fullerenes (buckyballs), among others. Early scientific studies have indicated that some of these na noscale particles may pose a greater health risk than the larger bulk form of these materials.\n【4】 Results from recent animal studies indicate that carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nano fibers (CNF) may pose a respiratory hazard. CNTs and CNFs are tiny, cylindrical, large aspect ratio, manufactured forms of carbon. There is no single type of carbon nanotube or nano fiber; one type can differ from another in shape, size, chemical composition (from residual metal catalysts or functionalization of the CNT and CNF) and other physical and chemical characteristics. Such variations in composition and size have added to the complexity of understanding their hazard potential. Occupational exposure to CNTs and CNFs can occur not only in the process of manufacturing them, but  at the point of incorporating these materials into other products and applications. A number of research studies with rodents have shown adverse lung effects at relatively low-mass doses of CNT and CNF, including pul monary inflammation and rapidly developing, persistent fibrosis. Although it is not known whether similar adverse health effects occur in humans after exposure to CNT and CNF, the results from animal research studies indicate the need to minimize worker exposure. This NIOSH CIB,  reviews the animal and other toxicological data relevant to assessing the potential non-malignant adverse respiratory effects of CNT and CNF,  provides a quantitative risk assessment based on animal dose-response data,  proposes a recom mended exposure limit (REL) of 1 ^g/m3 elemental carbon as a respirable mass 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration, and  describes strategies for controlling workplace exposures and implementing a medical surveillance program. The NIOSH REL is expected to reduce the risk for pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. However, because of some residual risk at the REL and uncertainty concerning chronic health effects, includ ing whether some types of CNTs may be carcinogenic, continued efforts should be made to reduce exposures as much as possible.\n【5】 Just prior to the release of this CIB NIOSH reported at the annual meeting of the Society of Toxicology  preliminary findings from a new laboratory study in which mice were exposed by inhalation to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) . The study was designed to investigate whether MWCNT have the potential to initiate or promote cancer. Mice receiving both an initiator chemical plus inhalation exposure to MWCNT were significantly more likely to develop tumors (90% incidence) and have more tumors than mice receiving the initiator chemical alone. These results indicate that MWCNT can increase the risk of cancer in mice exposed to a known carcinogen. The study did not indicate that MWCNTs alone cause can cer in mice. This research is an important step in our understanding of the hazards associ ated with MWCNT, but before we can determine whether MWCNT pose an occupational cancer risk, we need more information about workplace exposures, the types and nature of MWCNT being used in the workplace, and how that compares to the material used in this study. Research is underway at NIOSH to learn more about worker exposures and the potential occupational health risks associated with exposure to MWCNT and other types of CNTs and CNFs. As results from ongoing research become available, NIOSH will reassess its recommendations for CNT and CNF and make appropriate revisions as needed.\n【6】 NIOSH urges employers to share this information with workers and customers. NIOSH  requests that professional and trade associations and labor organizations inform their members about the potential hazards of CNT and CNF. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanofibers (CNFs) are some of the most promising ma terials to result from nanotechnology. The introduction of these materials and products using them into commerce has increased greatly in the last decade . The development of CNT-based applications in a wide range of products is expected to provide great societal benefit and it is important that they be developed re sponsibly to achieve that benefit . Worker safety and health is a cornerstone of responsible development of an emergent technology because workers are the first people in society to be exposed to the products of the technology and the workplace is the first opportunity to develop and implement responsible practices.\n【7】 In this Current Intelligence Bulletin, NIOSH continues its long-standing history of using the best available scientific information to assess potential hazards and risks and to provide guidance for protecting workers. Since it is early in the development of these materials and their applications, there is limited information on which to make protective recommenda tions. To date, NIOSH is not aware of any reports of adverse health effects in workers using or producing CNT or CNF. However, there are studies of animals exposed to CNT and CNF that are informative in predicting potential human health effects consistent with ways in which scientists traditionally have used such data in recommending risk management strategies. NIOSH systematically reviewed 54 laboratory animal studies, many of which indicated that CNT/CNF could cause adverse pulmonary effects including inflammation (44/, granulomas (27/, and pulmonary fibrosis (25/ . NIOSH considers these animal study findings to be relevant to human health risks because similar lung effects have been observed in workers exposed to respirable particulates of other materials in dusty jobs . There are well established correlations between results of animal studies and adverse effects in workers ex posed to particulates and other air contaminants , and the effects, includ ing fibrosis, developed soon after exposure and persisted . These are significant findings that warrant protective action. NIOSH conducted a quantitative assessment of risk using the animal studies with sufficient dose-response data, which included two subchronic (90-day) inhalation studies  and five additional studies  conducted by other routes or durations. The estimated risk of developing early-stage (slight or mild) lung effects over a working lifetime if exposed to CNT at the analytical limit of quantification (NIOSH Method  of 1 ^g/m3 (8-hr time-weighted average  as respirable elemental carbon) is approximately 0.5% to 16% (upper confidence limit estimates) . In addition, the working lifetime equivalent estimates of the animal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of CNT or CNF were  near 1 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA) . Therefore, NIOSH recommends that exposures to CNT and CNF be kept below the recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 ^g/m3 of respirable elemental carbon as an 8-hr TWA. Because there may be other sources of elemental carbon in the workplace that could interfere in the deter mination of CNT and CNF exposures, other analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy are described that could assist in characterizing exposures. Studies have shown that airborne background (environmental and in non-process areas in the workplace) concentrations to elemental carbon are typically less than 1 ^g/m3 and that an elevated exposure to elemental carbon in the workplace is a reasonable indicator of CNT or CNF exposure . Studies have  shown in some manufacturing operations that exposures can be controlled below the REL when engineering controls are used . However, NIOSH has not assessed the extent to which exposures can be controlled during the life cycle of CNT/CNF product use, but since airborne CNT/CNF behave as classical aerosols, the control of worker expo sures appears feasible with standard exposure control techniques (e.g., source enclosure, local-exhaust ventilation) . Previously in a 2010 draft of this CIB for public comment, NIOSH indicated that the risks could occur with exposures less than 1 ^g/m3 but that the analytic limit of quantification was 7 ^g/m3. Based on subsequent improvements in sampling and analytic methods, NIOSH is now recommending an exposure limit at the current analytical limit of quantification of 1 ^g/m3. More research is needed to fully characterize the health risks of CNT/CNF. Long-term ani mal studies and epidemiologic studies in workers would be especially informative. How ever, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicates that protective action is warranted. The recommended exposure limit is in units of mass/unit volume of air, which is how the exposures in the animal studies were quantified and it is the exposure metric that generally is used in the practice of industrial hygiene. In the future, as more data are ob tained, a recommended exposure limit might be based on a different exposure metric better correlated with toxicological effects, such as CNT/CNF number concentration .\n【8】 There are many uncertainties in assessing risks to workers exposed to CNT/CNF. These uncertainties, as described and evaluated in this document, do not lessen the concern or di minish the recommendations. Other investigators and organizations have been concerned about the same effects and have recommended occupational exposure limits (OELs) for CNT within the range of 1-50 ^g/m3 . The relative consistency in these proposed OELs demonstrates the need to manage CNT/CNF as a new and more active form of carbon. To put this in perspec tive, since there is no Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for CNT/CNF, the PEL for graphite  . However, the studied CNT and CNF only represent a fraction of the types of CNT and CNF that are, or will be, in commerce and it is anticipated that materials with different physical and chemi cal parameters could have different toxicities. At this time, however, given the findings in the published literature, NIOSH recommends that exposures to all CNT and CNF be con trolled to less than 1 ^g/m3 of respirable elemental carbon as an 8-hr TWA, and that the risk management guidance described in this document be followed. Until results from research can fully explain the physical-chemical properties of CNT and CNF that define their inha lation toxicity, all types of CNT and CNF should be considered a respiratory hazard and exposure should be controlled below the REL.\n【9】 In addition to controlling exposures below the REL, it is prudent for employers to insti tute medical surveillance and screening programs for workers who are exposed to CNT and CNF for the purpose of possibly detecting early signs of adverse pulmonary effects including fibrosis. Such an assessment can provide a secondary level of prevention should there be inadequacies in controlling workplace exposures. In 2009, NIOSH concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend specific medical tests for workers exposed to the broad category of engineered nanoparticles but when relevant toxicological informa tion became available, specific medical screening recommendations would be forthcoming . As described in this document, the toxicologic evidence on CNT/CNF has advanced to make specific recommendations for the medical surveillance and screening of exposed workers. That is, the strong evidence for pulmonary fibrosis from animal studies and the fact that this effect can be detected by medical tests is the basis for NIOSH specific medical screening recommendations. NIOSH  recommends other risk management practices in addition to controlling exposure and medical surveillance. These include edu cation and training of workers and the use of personal protective equipment (e.g., respira tors, clothing, and gloves).\n【10】 In summary, the findings and recommendations in this Current Intelligence Bulletin are intended to minimize the potential health risks associated with occupational exposure to CNT and CNF by recommending a working lifetime exposure limit (1 ^g/m3, 8-hr TWA, 45 years), a sampling and analytical method to detect CNT and CNF, medical surveillance and screening and other guidelines. The expanding use of CNT/CNF products in commerce and research warrants these protective actions.\n【11】 # B a c k g r o u n d\n【12】 The goal of this occupational safety and health guidance for carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofibers (CNT) is to prevent the development of adverse respiratory health ef fects in workers. To date, NIOSH is not aware of any reports of adverse health effects in workers producing or using CNT or CNF. The concern about worker exposure to CNT or CNF arises from the results of recent laboratory animal studies with CNT and CNF. Short term and subchronic studies in rats and mice have shown qualitatively consistent noncancerous adverse lung effects including pulmonary inflammation, granulomas, and fibrosis with inhalation, intratracheal instillation, or pharyngeal aspiration of several types of CNT (single or multiwall; purified or unpurified). These early-stage, noncancerous adverse lung effects in animals inclu\n【13】 Some studies  indicate that CNT containing certain metals (nickel, 26%)  or higher metal content (17.7% vs. 0.2% iron) are more cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo . Although a number of different types of CNT and CNF have been evaluated, uncertainty exists on the generalizability of the current animal findings to new CNT and CNF.\n【14】 In addition to the early-stage non-cancer lung effects in animals, some studies in cells or animals have shown genotoxic or carcinogenic effects. In vitro studies with human lung cells have shown that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) can cause genotoxicity and abnormal chromosome number by interfering with mitosis (cell division) . Other in vitro studies did not show evidence of genotoxicity of some MWCNT .\n【15】 Studies in mice exposed to multi-walled carbon nanotubes , but not short MWCNT (< 1 ^m in length) or tangled CNT . In rats administered CNT by peritoneal injection, the pleural inflammation and mesothelioma were related to the thin diameter and rigid structure of MWCNT . In a study of rats administered MWCNT or crocidolite by intrapulmonary spraying, exposure to either material produced inflammation in the lungs and pleural cavity in addition to mesothelial proliferative lesions .\n【16】 Pulmonary exposure to CNT has  produced systemic responses including an increase in inflammatory mediators in the blood, as well as oxidant stress in aortic tissue and in crease plaque formation in an atherosclerotic mouse model Erdely 2009]. Pulmonary exposure to MWCNT  depresses the ability of coronary arterioles to respond to dilators . These cardiovascular effects may be due to neurogenic signals from sensory irritant receptors in the lung. Mechanisms, such as in flammatory signals or neurogenic pathways causing these systemic responses, are under investigation.\n【17】 Additional research is needed to fully explain the mechanisms of biological responses to CNT and CNF, and the influence of physical-chemical properties. The findings of adverse respiratory effects and systemic effects reported in several animal studies indicate the need for protective measures to limit worker exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【18】 CNT and CNF are currently used in many industrial and biomedical applications, includ ing electronics, lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, super capacitors, thermoplastics, poly mer composites, coatings, adhesives, biosensors, enhanced electron-scanning microscopy imaging techniques, inks, and in pharmaceutical/biomedical devices. CNT and CNF can be encountered in facilities ranging from research laboratories and production plants to operations where CNT and CNF are processed, used, disposed, or recycled. The data on worker personal exposures to CNT and CNF are extremely limited, but reported workplace airborne concentrations for CNT  and CNF  indicate the potential for worker exposures in many tasks or processes and the reduction or elimination of expo sures when measures to control exposure are used. NIOSH has determined that the best data to use for a quantitative risk assessment and as basis for a recommended exposure limit (REL) are the nonmalignant pulmonary data from the CNT animal studies. At present, data on cancer and cardiovascular effects are not adequate for a quantitative risk assessment of inhalation exposure. NIOSH considers the pulmonary responses of inflammation and fibrosis observed in short-term and subchronic studies in animals to be relevant to humans, as inflammatory and fibrotic effects are  observed in occupational lung diseases associated with workplace exposures to other in haled particles and fibers. Uncertainties include the extent to which these lung effects in animals are associated with functional deficits and whether similar effects would be clini cally significant among workers. However, these fibrotic lung effects observed in some of the animal studies developed early (e.g., 28 days after exposure) in response to relatively low-mass lung doses, and  persisted or progressed after the end of exposure . Given the relevance of these types of lung effects to humans, the REL was derived using the published subchronic and short-term animal studies with dose-response data of early stage fibrotic and inflammatory lung responses to CNT exposure ( and Appendix A).\n【19】 Critical effect levels for the noncancerous lung effects estimated from the animal doseresponse data (e.g., BMD, benchmark dose and BMDL, the 95% lower confidence limit es timates of the BMD) have been extrapolated to humans by accounting for the factors influ encing the lung dose in each animal species. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) estimates reported in the subchronic inhalation studies were  evaluated as the critical effect levels. Working-lifetime exposure concentrations were calculated based on estimates of either the deposited or retained alveo lar lung dose of CNT assuming an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposure during a 40-hour workweek, 50 weeks per year, for 45 years. Based on BMD modeling of the sub chronic animal inhalation studies with MWCNT , a working lifetime exposure of 0.2-2 ^g/m3 (8-hour TWA concentration) was estimated to be associated with a 10% excess risk of early-stage adverse lung effects (95% lower confidence limit estimates) . Risk estimates derived from short-term animal stud ies  were consistent with these estimates.\n【20】 In addition to the BMD-based risk estimates, NOAEL or LOAEL values were used as the critical effect level in animals. As with the BMD(L) estimates, the human-equivalent working lifetime concentrations were estimated, although using dosimetric adjustment and uncer tainty factors . The estimated human-equivalent working lifetime concentra tions based on this approach were approximately 4-18 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA), depending on the subchronic study and the interspecies dose retention and normalization factors used. Divid ing these estimates by data-suitable uncertainty factors (e.g., UFs of 20-, and assuming a threshold model, the estimated zero risk levels were <1 ^g/m3 as working lifetime 8-hr TWA concentrations. A recent subchronic inhalation (13-wk exposure plus 3 months follow-up) study of CNF in rats  showed qualitatively similar lung response as in a shorter-term (28-day) study of CNF administered by pharyngeal aspiration in mice  . Using the NOAEL-based approach, the humanequivalent working lifetime concentration estimates were 1-4 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA), depend ing on the data and assumptions used to estimate the human-equivalent dose .\n【21】 In the 2010 draft Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers, NIOSH proposed a REL of 7 ^g/m3 elemental carbon (EC) 8-hr TWA, which was set at the upper limit of quantitation (LOQ) for NIOSH Method 5040 . In the draft CIB, NIOSH acknowledged that workers may still have an excess risk of developing early-stage pulmonary effects including fibrosis if exposed over a full working lifetime at the proposed REL. In view of these health risks, and ongoing improvements in sampling and analytical methodologies, NIOSH is recommending a REL of 1 ^g/m3 EC as an 8-hr TWA respirable mass concentration using NIOSH Method 5040 (1, Appendix C). The 45-yr working lifetime excess risk estimates of minimal level (grade 1 or greater) lung effects in rats observed by histopathology at 1 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA concentration) range from 2.4% to 33% (maximum likelihood estimates, MLE) and 5.3% to 54% (95% upper confidence limit, UCL) estimates . The 45-yr working lifetime excess risk estimates of slight/mild (grade  lung effects at 1 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA) range from 0.23% to 10% MLE and 0.53% to 16% (95% UCL) . These estimates are based on a risk assessment using dose-response data from the rat subchronic inhalation studies of two types of MWCNT. The range in these risk estimates reflects differences across studies and/or types of MWCNT and the uncertainty in the estimation of working lifetime CNT lung burden. The lung burden estimates are based on either the retained lung dose (normal clearance) or deposited lung dose (no clearance). Although data from animal stud ies with CNF are more limited , physical-chemical similarities between CNT and CNF and findings of acute pulmonary inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in animals exposed to CNF  indicate the need to  control occupational exposure to CNF at the REL of 1 ^g/m3 EC. Because of uncertainties in the risk estimates some residual risk for adverse lung effects may exist at the REL; there fore, efforts should be made to reduce airborne concentrations to CNT and CNF as low as possible. Until the results from animal research studies can fully explain the mechanisms (e.g., shape, size, chemistry, functionalized) that potentially increase or decrease their toxic ity all types of CNT and CNF should be considered a respiratory hazard and occupational exposures controlled at the REL of 1 ^g/m3. E x p o s u r e M e a s u r e m e n t a n d C o n t r o l s Occupational exposure to all types of CNT and CNF can be quantified using NIOSH Meth od 5040. A multi-tiered exposure measurement strategy is recommended for determin ing worker exposure to CNT and CNF . When exposure to other types of EC (e.g., diesel soot, carbon black) are absent or negligible, environmental background EC concentrations are typically < 1 ^g/m3 including in facilities where CNT and CNF are produced and used . Thus, an elevated airborne EC concentration relative to background (environmental and in non-process ar eas in the workplace) is a reasonable indicator of CNT or CNF exposure. When exposure to other types of EC is possible, additional analytical techniques may be required to better characterize exposures. For example, analysis of airborne samples by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) can help to verify the presence of CNT and CNF (1..\n【22】 Published reports of worker exposure to CNT and CNF using NIOSH Method 5040 (EC determination) are limited but in the study by Dahm  worker personal breath ing zone (PBZ) samples collected at CNT manufacturers frequently found low to nondetectable mass concentrations of EC when engineering controls were present. In a study by Birch , the outdoor air concentrations over four survey days, two months apart, were nearly identical, averaging about 0.5 ^g/m3. Respirable EC area concentrations inside the facility were about 6-68 times higher than outdoors, while personal breathing zone samples were up to 170 times higher. In studies where airborne particle concentrations were used as a surrogate for measuring the potential release of CNT and CNF, the use of engineering controls (e.g., local exhaust ventilation, wet cutting of composites, fume hood/ enclosures) appeared to be effective in reducing worker exposure  . Howev er, direct reading instruments used in these studies are non-selective tools and often subject to interferences due to other particle sources, especially at low concentrations . Control strategies and technologies developed by several indus trial trade associations have proven successful in managing micrometer-sized fine powder processes, and should have direct application to controlling worker exposures from CNT and CNF processes. Examples include guidance issued for containing dry powder during manufacturing of detergents by the Association Internationale de la Savonnerie, de la Dé tergence et des Produits d'Entretien (AISE) . Following these guidelines makes it possible, at a minimum, to control enzyme-containing dust exposures below 60 ng/m3 for enzymes. Additional guidance on a broader process and facility approach is available from the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). This organization offers guidance on the design, containment, and testing of various processes that handle finely divided dry powder formulations. One guide in particular, Baseline Guide Volume 1, 2nd Edition: Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Revision to Bulk Pharmaceutical Chemi cals, has broad applicability to CNT and CNF processes and is available from ISPE . Finally, the Institute for Polyacrylate Absorbents (IPA) has developed guidelines for its member companies to assist them in controlling worker exposures to fine polyacrylate polymer dust in the micrometer-size range through a combination of engineering controls and work practices . The extent to which worker exposure to CNT and CNF can be controlled below 1 ^g/m3 respirable mass concentration as an 8-hr TWA is unknown, but should be achievable in most manufacturing and end-use job tasks if engineering con trols are used and workers are instructed in the safe handling of CNT/CNF materials.\n【23】 Until results from research studies can fully explain the physical-chemical properties of CNT and CNF that define their inhalation toxicity, all types of CNT and CNF should be considered a respiratory hazard, and exposures should be controlled as low as possible below the REL. The REL is based on the respirable airborne mass concentration of CNT and CNF because the adverse lung effects in animals were observed in the alveolar (gas exchange) region. \"Respirable\" is defined as the aerodynamic size of particles that, when inhaled, are capable of depositing in the alveolar region of the lungs . Sampling methods have been developed to estimate the airborne mass concentration of respirable particles . Reliance on a respirable EC mass-based REL will provide a means to identify job tasks with potential exposures to CNT and CNF so that appropriate measures can be taken to limit worker exposure.\n【24】 # R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s\n【25】 In light of current scientific evidence from experimental animal studies concerning the haz ard potential of CNT and CNF, steps should be taken to implement an occupational health surveillance program that includes elements of hazard and medical surveillance. NIOSH recommends that employers and workers take the following steps to minimize potential health risks associated with exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【26】 # . R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s f o r E m p l o y e r s\n【27】 - Use available information to continually assess current hazard potential related to CNT and CNF exposures in the workplace and make appropriate changes (e.g., sampling and analysis, exposure control) to protect worker health. At a minimum, follow require ments of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard  and the Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response Standard .\n【28】 - Identify and characterize processes and job tasks where workers encounter bulk (\"free-form\") CNT or CNF and materials that contain CNT/CNF (e.g., composites).\n【29】 - Substitute, when possible, a nonhazardous or less hazardous material for CNT and CNF. When substitution is not possible, use engineering controls as the primary method for minimizing worker exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【30】 - Establish criteria and procedures for selecting, installing, and evaluating the performance of engineering controls to ensure proper operating conditions. Make sure workers are trained in how to check and use exposure controls (e.g., exhaust ventilation systems).\n【31】 - Routinely evaluate airborne exposures to ensure that control measures are working properly and that worker exposures are being maintained below the NIOSH REL of 1 ^g/m3 using NIOSH Method 5040 ( and Appendix C).\n【32】 - Follow exposure and hazard assessment procedures for determining the need for and selection of proper personal protective equipment, such as clothing, gloves, and res pirators .\n【33】 - Educate workers on the sources and job tasks that may expose them to CNT and CNF, and train them about how to use appropriate controls, work practices, and personal protective equipment to minimize exposure .\n【34】 - Provide facilities for hand washing and encourage workers to make use of these facili ties before eating, smoking, or leaving the worksite.\n【35】 - Provide facilities for showering and changing clothes, with separate facilities for stor age of nonwork clothing, to prevent the inadvertent cross-contamination of nonwork areas (including take-home contamination).\n【36】 - Use light-colored gloves, lab coats, and workbench surfaces to make contamination by dark CNT and CNF easier to see.\n【37】 - Develop and implement procedures to deal with cleanup of CNT and CNF spills and decontamination of surfaces.\n【38】 - When respirators are provided for worker protection, the OSHA respiratory protec tion standard  requires that a respiratory protection program be established that includes the following elements:\n【39】 -A medical evaluation of the worker's ability to perform the work while wearing a respirator.\n【40】 -Regular training of personnel.\n【41】 -Periodic workplace exposure monitoring.\n【42】 -Procedures for selecting respirators.\n【43】 -Respirator fit testing.\n【44】 -Respirator maintenance, inspection, cleaning, and storage.\n【45】 - The voluntary use of respirators are permitted, but must comply with the provisions set forth in CFR 1910.134(c)(i) and CFR 1910.134(c)(ii).\n【46】 - Information on the potential health risks and recommended risk management prac tices contained in this CIB should, at a minimum, be used when developing labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDS), as required .\n【47】 1 .1 M e d i c a l S c r e e n i n g a n d S u r v e i l l a n c e\n【48】 The evidence summarized in this document leads to the conclusion that workers occupation ally exposed to CNT and CNF may be at risk of adverse respiratory effects. These workers may benefit from inclusion in a medical screening program to help protect their health .\n【49】 # W orker Participation\n【50】 Workers who could receive the greatest benefit from medical screening include the following:\n【51】 - Workers exposed to concentrations of CNT or CNF in excess of the REL (i.e., all workers exposed to airborne CNT or CNF at concentrations above 1 ^g/m3 EC as an 8-hr TWA).\n【52】 - Workers in areas or jobs that have been qualitatively determined (by the person charged with program oversight) to have the potential for intermittent elevated air borne concentrations to CNT or CNF (i.e., workers are at risk of being exposed when they are involved in the transfer, weighing, blending, or mixing of bulk CNT or CNF, or the cutting or grinding of composite materials containing CNT or CNF, or workers in areas where such activities are carried out by others).\n【53】 # Program Oversight\n【54】 Oversight of the medical surveillance program should be assigned to a qualified health care professional who is informed and knowledgeable about potential workplace expo sures, routes of exposure, and potential health effects related to CNT and CNF.\n【55】 # Screening Elements\n【56】 In i t ia l E v a lu a t io n\n【57】 - An initial (baseline) evaluation should be conducted by a qualified health-care profes sional and should consist of the following:\n【58】 -An occupational and medical history, with respiratory symptoms assessed by use of a standardized questionnaire, such as the American Thoracic Society Respiratory Questionnaire  or the most recent.\n【59】 -A physical examination with an emphasis on the respiratory system.\n【60】 -A spirometry test (Anyone administering spirometry testing as part of the medical screening program should have completed a NIOSH-approved training course in spirometry or other equivalent training; additionally, the health professional overseeing the screening and surveillance program should be expert in interpreting spirometry testing results, enabling follow-up evaluation as needed.).\n【61】 -A baseline chest X-ray (digital or film-screen radiograph). All baseline chest images should be clinically interpreted by a board eligible/certified radiologist or other physician with appropriate expertise, such as a board eligible/certified pulmonologist. Periodic follow up chest X-rays may be considered, but there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate effectiveness. However, if periodic follow up is obtained, clinical interpretation and classification of the images by a NIOSH-certified B reader using the standard International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses (ILO 2011 or the most recent equivalent) are recommended.\n【62】 -Other examinations or medical tests deemed appropriate by the responsible health-care professional (The need for specific medical tests may be based on factors such as abnormal findings on initial examination-for example, the findings of an unexplained abnormality on a chest X-ray should prompt further evaluation that might include the use of high-resolution computed tomography scan of the thorax.).\n【63】 - Evaluations should be conducted at regular intervals and at other times (e.g., post incident) as deemed appropriate by the responsible health-care professional based on data gathered in the initial evaluation, ongoing work history, changes in symp toms such as new, worsening, or persistent respiratory symptoms, and when process changes occur in the workplace (e.g., a change in how CNT or CNF are manufactured or used or an unintentional \"spill\"). Evaluations should include the following:\n【64】 -An occupational and medical history update, including a respiratory symptom update, and focused physical examination-performed annually.\n【65】 -Spirometry-testing less frequently than every 3 years is not recommended ; and -Consideration of specific medical tests (e.g., chest X-ray).\n【66】 Written reports of medical findings\n【67】 - The health-care professional should give each worker a written report containing the following:\n【68】 -The individual worker's medical examination results.\n【69】 -Medical opinions and/or recommendations concerning any relationships between the individual worker's medical conditions and occupational exposures, any special instructions on the individual's exposures and/or use of personal protective equipment, and any further evaluation or treatment.\n【70】 - For each examined employee, the health-care professional should give the employer a written report specifying the following:\n【71】 -Any work or exposure restrictions based on the results of medical evaluations.\n【72】 -Any recommendations concerning use of personal protective equipment.\n【73】 -A medical opinion about whether any of the worker's medical conditions is likely to have been caused or aggravated by occupational exposures.\n【74】 - Findings from the medical evaluations having no bearing on the worker's ability to work with CNT or CNF should not be included in any reports to employers. Confidentiality of the worker's medical records should be enforced in accordance with all applicable regulations and guidelines.\n【75】 # W orker Education\n【76】 Workers should be provided information sufficient to allow them to understand the nature of potential workplace exposures, potential health risks, routes of exposure, and instruc tions for reporting health symptoms. Workers should  be provided with information about the purposes of medical screening, the health benefits of the program, and the pro cedures involved.\n【77】 # Periodic Evaluation of Data and Screening Program\n【78】 - Standardized medical screening data should be periodically aggregated and evaluated to identify worker health patterns that may be linked to work activities and practices P eriodic E valuations that require additional primary prevention efforts. This analysis should be performed by a qualified health professional or other knowledgeable person to identify worker health patterns that may be linked to work activities or exposures. Confidentiality of workers' medical records should be enforced in accordance with all applicable regula tions and guidelines.\n【79】 - Employers should periodically evaluate the elements of the medical screening pro gram to ensure that the program is consistent with current knowledge related to ex posures and health effects associated with occupational exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【80】 Other important components related to occupational health surveillance programs, includ ing medical surveillance and screening, are discussed in Appendix B.\n【81】 # . R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s f o r W o r k e r s\n【82】 - Ask your supervisor for training in how to protect yourself from the potential hazards associated with your job, including exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【83】 - Know and use the exposure control devices and work practices that keep CNT and CNF out of the air and off your skin.\n【84】 - Understand when and how to wear a respirator and other personal protective equipment (such as gloves, clothing, eyewear) that your employer might provide.\n【85】 - Avoid handling CNT and CNF in a 'free particle' state (e.g., powder form).\n【86】 - Store CNT and CNF, whether suspended in liquids or in a powder form, in closed (tightly sealed) containers whenever possible.\n【87】 - Clean work areas at the end of each work shift (at a minimum) using a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner or wet wiping methods. Dry sweeping or air hoses should not be used to clean work areas.\n【88】 - Do not store or consume food or beverages in workplaces where bulk CNT or CNF, or where CNT-or CNF-containing materials, are handled.\n【89】 - Prevent the inadvertent contamination of nonwork areas (including take-home con tamination) by showering and changing into clean clothes at the end of each workday.  . CNF have lengths rang ing from tens of micrometers to several centime ters, average aspect ratios (length to diameter ratio) of > 100, and they display various morphologies, including cupped or stacked graphene structures. The primary characteristic that distinguishes CNF from CNT resides in graphene plane alignment. If the graphene plane and fiber axis do not align, the structure is defined as CNF, but when parallel, the structure is considered a CNT .\n【90】 The synthesis of CNT and CNF requires a carbon source and an energy source . CNT and CNF are synthesized by several distinct methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), arc discharge, laser ablation, and highpressure CO conversion (HiPco). Depending on material and method of synthesis, a metal catalyst maybe used to increase yield and sample homo geneity, and to reduce the synthesis temperature. The diameter of the fibers depends on the dimen sions of the metal nanoparticle used as a catalyst; the shape, symmetry, dimensions, growth rate, and crystallinity of the materials are influenced by the selection of the catalyst, carbon source, tempera ture, and time of the reaction. Different amounts of residual catalyst often exist following synthesis; consequently, post-synthesis treatments are used to increase the purity of the product. The most common purification technique involves selec tive oxidation of the amorphous carbon and/or carbon shells at a controlled temperature followed by washing or sonicating the material in an acid (HCL, HNO3, H2SO or base (NaOH) to remove the catalyst. As there are many types of purifica tion processes, purified CNT and CNF will exhibit differences in the content of trace elements and re sidual materials .\n【91】 A growing body of literature indicates a potential health hazard to workers from exposure to various types of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. A num ber of research studies with rodents have shown adverse lung effects at relatively low-mass doses of CNT , including pulmonary inflammation and rapidly developing, persistent fi brosis. Similar effects have been recently observed with exposure to CNF (-. It is not known how universal these adverse effects are, that is, whether they occur in animals exposed to all types of CNT and CNF, and whether they occur in ad ditional animal models. Most importantly, it is not yet known whether similar adverse health effects occur in humans following exposure to CNT or CNF, or how airborne CNT in the workplace may compare in size and structure to the CNT aerosols generated in the animal studies.\n【92】 Because of their small size, structure, and low sur face charge, CNT and CNF can be difficult to sepa rate in the bulk form and tend to be agglomerated or to agglomerate quickly when released in the air, which can affect their potential to be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. The extent to which work ers are exposed to CNT and CNF in the form of agglomerates or as single tubes or structures is unclear because of limited exposure measurement data, but airborne samples analyzed by electron mi croscopy have shown both individual and agglom erated structures .\n【93】 This Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) summarizes the adverse respiratory health effects that have been observed in laboratory animal studies with SWCNT, MWCNT, and CNF. A recommended exposure lim it (REL) for CNT and CNF is given to help minimize the risk of occupational respiratory disease in work ers as well as guidance for the measurement and control of exposures to CNT and CNF.\n【94】 # P o t e n t i a l f o r E x p o s u r e\n【95】 The novel application of CNT and CNF has been extensively researched because of their unique physical and chemical properties. CNT and CNF are mechanically strong, flexible, lightweight, heat resistant, and they have high electrical conductiv ity . The purpose of the study was to enumerate the companies directly manufacturing (or using in other manufacturing processes) engineered carbonaceous nanomaterials in the United States, and to estimate the workforce size and characteristics of nanomaterials produced.\n【96】 The number of workers engaged in the manufactur ing of CNT was estimated at 375, with a projected growth rate in employment of 15% to 17% annu ally. The quantity of CNT (SWCNT and MWCNT) produced annually by each company was estimated to range from 0.2 to 2500 kg. The size of the work force involved in the fabrication or handling of CNT/CNF-enabled materials and composites is un known, but it is expected to increase as the market expands from research and development to indus trial high-volume production .   Maynard   assessed the propensity for SWCNT to be released during the agitation of unprocessed SWCNT material in a laboratorybased study and during the handling (e.g., furnace removal, powder transfer, cleaning) of unrefined material at four small-scale SWCNT manufac turing facilities in which laser ablation and highpressure carbon monoxide techniques were used to produce SWCNT. Particle measurements taken during the agitation of unprocessed material in the laboratory indicated the initial airborne release of material (some visually apparent) with the particle concentration of the aerosol (particles < 0.5 ^m in diameter) observed to decrease rapidly over time.\n【97】 With no agitation, particles around 0.1 ^m in di ameter appeared to be released from the SWCNT material, probably because of the airflow across the powder. At the four manufacturing facilities, short term SWCNT mass concentrations were estimated (using a catalyst metal as the surrogate measure ment) to range from 0.7 to 53 ^g/m3 (area samples) in the absence of exposure controls. When samples were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), most of the aerosolized SWCNT were ag glomerated, with agglomerated sizes typically larg er than 1 ^m.\n【98】 Airborne particle and MWCNT concentrations were determined by Bello  during chemical vapor deposition (CVD), growth, and handling of vertically aligned CNT films. Continuous airborne particle measurements were made using a real-time fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS) and a condensa tion particle counter (CPC) throughout the furnace operation. No increase in total airborne particle concentration (compared with background) was observed during the removal of MWCNT from the reactor furnace or during the detachment of MW-CNT from the growth substrate (a process whereby MWCNT are removed from the substrate with a ra zor blade). Electron microscopic analysis of a PBZ sample collected on the furnace operator found no detectable quantity of MWCNT, either as individual tubes or as agglomerates. No mention was made about the use of engineering controls (e.g., local exhaust ventilation, fume hood) to prevent expo sure to MWCNT.\n【99】 The potential for airborne particle and SWCNT and MWCNT release was determined in a labora tory setting in which both types of CNT were pro duced using CVD . A qualitative assessment of the exposure  which were used as catalysts in the synthesis of MWCNT. The highest airborne particle releases were observed in area samples collected during catalyst preparation .\n【100】 Other handling processes such as CNT preparation, ultrasonic dispersion, and opening the CNT spray cover  generated the release of nanoparticles.\n【101】 The ultrasonic dispersion of CNT generated parti cles in the range of 120 to 300 nm, which were larger in size than those released from other processes.\n【102】 The release of airborne carbon-based nanomate rials (CNMs) was investigated during the transfer and ultrasonic dispersion of MWCNT (10-20 nm diameters), fullerenes, and carbon black (15 nm diameter) inside a laboratory fume hood with the airflow turned off and the sash halfway open . Airborne exposure measurements were made during the weighing and transferring of dry CNMs to beakers filled with reconstituted freshwater with and without natural organic matter and then sonicated. The study was designed to de termine the relative magnitude of airborne nano material emissions associated with tasks and ma terials used to evaluate environmentally relevant matrices (e.g., rivers, ponds, reservoirs). Direct reading real-time instruments (i.e., CPC, OPC) were used to determine airborne particle number concentrations, with the results compared with particle number concentrations determined from general air samples collected in the laboratory be fore and after the laboratory process. Samples were  collected for TEM analysis to verify the pres ence of CNMs. Airborne particle number concen trations for all tasks exceeded background particle concentrations, which were inversely related to particle size, with the size distribution of particles skewed toward those CNMs with an aerodynamic diameter < 1 ^m. Airborne particle number con centrations for MWCNT and carbon black, during the sonication of water samples, were significantly greater than those found during the weighing and transferring of dry CNMs. TEM analysis of air borne area samples revealed agglomerates of all CNMs, with MWCNT agglomerates observed to be 500 to 1,000 nm in diameter.\n【103】 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted emission and exposure assessment studies at 12 sites where engineered nanomaterials were produced or used . Studies were conducted in research and development laboratories, pilot plants, and smallscale manufacturing facilities handling SWCNT, MWCNT, CNF, fullerenes, carbon nanopearls, metal oxides, electrospun nylon, and quantum dots. Airborne exposures were characterized using a variety of measurement techniques (e.g., CPC, OPC, TEM) . The purpose of the studies was to determine whether airborne exposures to these engineered nanomaterials oc cur and to assess the capabilities of various mea surement techniques in quantifying exposures. In a research and development laboratory handling CNF, airborne particle number concentrations (de termined by CPC) were reported as 4000 particles/ cm3 during weighing/mixing and 5000 particles/ cm3 during wet sawing. These concentrations were substantially less than the reported background particle concentration of 19,500 particles/cm3. Samples collected for TEM particle characteriza tion indicated the aerosol release of some CNF. All handling of CNF was in a laboratory hood (with HEPA filtered vacuum) for the weighing/mixing and wet saw cutting of CNF composite materials.\n【104】 In a facility making CNF in a chemical vapor phase reactor, OPC particle count concentrations ranged from 5,400 particles/cm3 (300-500 nm particle size) to a high of 139,500 particles/cm3 (500-100 nm particle size). Higher airborne particle concen trations were found during the manual scooping of CNF in the absence of exposure control measures. Samples collected for TEM particle characteriza tion indicated the aerosol release of some CNF. In another research and development laboratory, the potential for airborne exposure to MWCNT was evaluated during weighing, mixing, and sonication. All handling of MWCNT was performed in a laboratory hood (without HEPA filtered vacu um). Particle concentrations were determined by CPC (particle size 10-1000nm) and OPC (particle size 300-500nm, 500-100nm). CPC particle con centrations ranged from 1480-1580 particles/cm3 (weighing MWCNT in hood) to 2200-2800 parti cles/cm3 (sonication of MWCNT). The background particle concentration determined by CPC was 700 particles/cm3. Airborne particle concentrations determined by OPC ranged from 3,900-123,400 particles/cm3 (weighing) to 6,500-42,800 particles/ cm3 (sonication). Background particle concen trations determined by OPC ranged from 700 particles/cm 3 (1-10 ^m particle size) to 13,700 particles/cm3 (300-500 nm particle size). The higher particle concentrations determined with the OPC indicated the presence of larger, possibly agglomer ated particles. Samples collected for TEM particle characterization indicated the aerosol release of ag glomerated MWCNT.\n【105】 Subsequent studies conducted by NIOSH at six primary and secondary pilot or small-scale man ufacturing facilities (SWCNT, MWCNT, CNF) employed a combination of filter-based samples to evaluate PBZ and area respirable and inhalable mass concentrations of EC as well as concentra tions of CNT and CNF structures determined by TEM analysis . A total of 83 filter-based samples (30 samples at primary and 22 at secondary manufacturers) were collected for EC determination (NIOSH Method  and 31 samples for TEM analysis (NIOSH Method . Similar processes and tasks were reported in the three primary and three secondary manufactur ers of CNT. These processes and tasks consisted of:\n【106】 similar production and harvesting methods for CNT, and common cleaning/housekeeping proce dures in primary manufacturers, and ( 2 In a study designed to investigate the release of CNT during the dry and wet cutting of composite materials containing CNT, airborne samples were collected to determine particle number, respirable mass, and nanotube concentrations . Two different composites containing MWCNT (10-20 nm diameters) were cut using a band saw or rotary cutting wheel. The laboratory study was designed to simulate the industrial cutting of CNTbased composites. PBZ and area samples (close to the emission source) were collected during dry cutting (without emission controls) and during wet cutting (equipped with a protective guard sur rounding the rotary cutting wheel). The cutting of composite materials ranged from 1 to 3 minutes. The dry cutting of composite materials generated statistically significant (P < 0. quantities of air borne nanoscale and fine particles when compared with background airborne particle concentrations.\n【107】 Although the particle number concentration was dominated by the nanoscale and fine fractions, 71% to 89% of the total particle surface area was domi nated by the respirable (1-10 ^m) aerosol fraction.\n【108】 During the dry cutting of composites, reported mean PM10 mass concentrations for area samples were 2.11 and 8.38 mg/m3, and 0.8 and 2.4 mg/m3 for PBZ samples. Submicron and respirable fibers were generated from dry cutting of all composites. TEM analysis of area samples found concentrations that ranged from1.6 fibers/cm3 (during the cutting of CNT-alumina) to 3.8 fibers/cm3 (during the cut ting of carbon-base composite materials). A PBZ fiber concentration of 0.2 fibers/cm3 was observed during the dry cutting of base-alumina composite materials. No fiber measurement data were report ed for the wet cutting of composite materials. No increase in mean PM10 mass concentrations were observed in 2 of 3 area samples collected during the wet cutting of composites. In the third sample, the observed high particle concentration was attrib uted to extensive damage of the protective guard around the rotary cutting wheel. Bello   investigated the airborne release of CNT and other nanosized fibers dur ing solid core drilling of two types of advanced CNT-hybrid composites:  reinforced plastic hybrid laminates (alumina fibers and CNT), and\n【109】 graphite-epoxy composites (carbon fibers and CNT). Worker PBZ and area samples were col lected to determine exposures during the drilling of composite materials with local exhaust ventilation turned off. Four potential exposure-modifying fac tors were assessed:  by composite type,  drill ing rpm (low and high),  thickness of the com posite, and  dry versus wet drilling. Replicate test measurements (10-30 measurements) lasting  10 nm in diam eter. High aspect-ratio fiber concentrations were determined using the sizing and counting criteria in NIOSH Method 7400 (> 5 ^m long, aspect ratio > . Airborne exposure to both alumina fiber and CNT structures were found ranging in concentra tion from 1.0 fibers/cm3 (alumina composite) to 1.9 fibers/cm3 (carbon and CNT composite) for PBZ samples; similar concentrations were observed in area samples. Because sampling volume and fi ber surface density on the samples were below the optimal specification range of Method 7400, fiber concentration values were determined to be first order approximations. The authors concluded that higher input energies (e.g., higher drilling rpms, larger drill bits) and longer drill times associated with thicker composites generally produced higher exposures, and that the drilling of CNT-based com posites generated a higher frequency of nanofibers than had been previously observed during the cut ting of CNT-based composites . Cena and Peters  evaluated the airborne release of CNT during the weighing of bulk CNT and the sanding of epoxy nanocomposite sticks measuring 12.5 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. Epoxy reinforced test samples were produced using MWCNT (Bay-tubes) with 10-50 nm outer diameters and 1-20 ^m lengths. The purpose of the study was to  characterize airborne particles during handling of bulk CNT and the mechanical processing of CNT composites, and  evaluate the effectiveness of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) hoods to capture airborne particles generated by sanding CNT com posites. Airborne particle number and respirable mass concentrations were measured using a CPC (particle diameters 0.01 to 1 ^m) and OPC (par ticle diameters 0.3 to 20 ^m). Respirable mass con centrations were estimated using the OPC data.\n【110】 Samples for TEM analysis were  collected for particle and CNT characterization. PBZ and source airborne concentrations were determined during two processes: weighing bulk CNT and sanding epoxy nanocomposite test sticks. Exposure mea surements were taken under three LEV conditions (no LEV, a custom fume hood, and a biological safety cabinet). CPC and OPC particle concentra tions were measured inside a glove box in which bulk CNT (600 mg) was transferred between two 50-ml beakers; background particle concentra tions were measured inside the glove box before the process began. To study the sanding process, a worker manually sanded test sticks that contained 2% by weight CNT. Aerosol concentrations were measured for 15-20 min in the worker's breathing zone and at a site adjacent to the sanding process. The sanding process with no LEV was conducted on a 1.2 m by 2.2 m worktable. The sanding was  conducted inside a custom fume hood that consisted of a simple vented enclosure that allowed airflow along all sides of the back panel but had no front sash or rear baffles. The average face velocity of the fume hood was 76 ft/min. Exposures from the sanding process were  assessed while using a biological safety cabinet (class II type A.\n【111】 Particle number concentrations determined dur ing the weighing process contributed little to that observed in background samples (process to back ground ratio  = 1., however it did influ ence the mass concentration (P/B = 1.. The GM respirable mass concentration inside the glove box was reported as 0.03 ^g/m3 (background GM was 0.02 ^g/m. During the sanding process (including no LEV, in a fume hood, and in a biological safety cabinet) the PBZ nanoparticle number concentra tions were negligible compared with background concentrations (P/B ratio = avg. 1.. Particles gen erated during sanding were reported to be predomi nantly micron sized with protruding CNT and very different from bulk CNT that tended to remain in large (>1 ^m) tangled agglomerates. Respirable mass concentrations in the worker's breathing zone were elevated. However, the concentrations were lower when sanding was performed in the biological safety cabinet (GM = 0.2 ^g/m compared with those with no LEV (GM was 2.68 ^g/m or those when sand ing was performed inside the fume hood (GM = 21.4 ^g/m3; p value <0.. The poor performance of the fume hood was attributed to the lack of a front sash and rear baffles and its low face velocity.   Some research has been conducted to date on workplace exposure to carbon nanofibers (CNF) . In a NIOSH health hazard eval uation conducted at a university-based research laboratory, the potential release of airborne CNF was observed at various processes using real-time aerosol instruments (e.g., CPC, ELPI, aerosol pho tometer) . General area ex posure measurements indicated slight increases in airborne particle number and mass concentrations relative to background measurements (outdoors and offices) during the transfer of CNF prior to weighing and mixing, and during the chopping and wet saw cutting of a polymer composite ma terial. Airborne total carbon mass concentrations (per NIOSH Method 5040, with correction for adsorbed vapor) within the laboratory process ing area were 2 to 64 times higher than those of a nearby office area, with the highest peak exposure concentration (1094 ^g/m found during the wet saw cutting of the CNF composite material. No in door particle concentrations exceeded the outdoor background concentrations. Particles having a di ameter of about 400 nm or greater were found in greater number during wet-saw cutting, while the number of particles having a diameter of about 500 nm or greater were elevated during the weigh ing and mixing of CNF. Airborne samples collected directly on TEM grids were analyzed for the pres ence of CNF. Some fibers observed by TEM had diameters larger than the 100 nm criterion used to define a nanofiber, which was consistent with re sults reported by Ku , in which the mo bility diameter of aerosolized CNF was observed to be larger than 60 nm, with a modal aerodynamic diameter of about 700 nm. The majority of CNF observed by TEM were loosely agglomerated, rath er than single fibers, which was in general agree ment with the particle size measurements made by real-time instruments.\n【112】 Detailed investigations of exposures at different job tasks were conducted at a facility manufacturing and processing CNF   The tamping of the bag to settle contents and the subsequent closing dispersed CNF through the bag opening into the workplace. High particle number and active surface area concentrations were found during the opening of the dryer and during the manual redistribution of the CNF product. This was attributed to the presence of ultrafine particles emitted from the dryer and as by-products formed through the high-temperature thermal processing of CNF. No elevations in respirable mass concen trations were observed during these operations, suggesting that significant quantities of CNF were not released into the workplace. However, the transfer or dumping of dried CNF from a dryer to a drum, and subsequent bag change-out of final product, contributed the largest transient increases in respirable mass concentrations, with concentra tions exceeding 1.1 mg/m3 for transfer or dump ing and 0.5 mg/m3 for bag change-out. The authors concluded that integrated particle number and ac tive surface area concentrations (i.e., using CPC and diffusion charger) were not useful in assess ing the contribution of emissions from CNF in the workplace, because measurements were dominated by ultrafine particle emissions .\n【113】 Respirable particle mass concentrations estimated by the photometer appeared to be the most useful and practical metric for measuring CNF when us ing direct-reading instruments. Results obtained for filter samples support the direct-reading instru ment findings. The TEM analyses of size-selective area samples indicated that large fiber bundles were present . In addition, sizeclassified samples (collected with impactors) ana lyzed for EC (by NIOSH  indicated CNF par ticles in the micrometer range .\n【114】 F ig u re 2 -1 . Workplaces and job tasks with potential for occupational exposure to carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. Adapted from Schulte 2008. Various types of laboratory animal studies have been conducted with CNT and CNF using differ ent routes of exposure to evaluate potential toxic ity . These studies have shown a consistent toxicological response (e.g., pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis) independent of the study design (i.e., intratracheal, aspiration, and inhalation). Exposure to SWCNT, MWCNT, and CNF are of special concern because of their small size and fibrous structure. The nanometer diameters and micrometer lengths of some materi als closely resemble the dimensions of some min eral fibers (e.g., asbestos). Results from laboratory animal studies with SWCNT, MWCNT, and CNF  show pulmonary responses similar to those reported for some respirable particles and durable fibers. In some studies, CNT-induced lung fibrosis developed more rapidly and at a lower mass burden than either ultrafine carbon black or quartz . Pulmonary exposure to CNT has  produced systemic responses including an increase in inflammatory mediators in the blood, as well as oxidant stress in aortic tissue and increase plaque formation in an atherosclerotic mouse model Erdely 2009;Stapleton 2011].\n【115】 CNT and CNF are widely considered durable in biological systems because of the process they undergo during synthesis in which contaminat ing catalytic metals are frequently removed by high temperature vaporization or acid/base treat ment . Researchers  have measured the durability (in vitro) of four types of CNT, one type of glass wool fiber, and two asbestos fiber types in simu lated biological fluid (Gambles solution) followed by an assessment of their ability to induce an in flammatory response when injected into the ab dominal cavities of mice. Three of the four types of CNT tested for durability showed no signs, or minimal loss of mass, or change in fiber length, or morphology. When the four CNTs were injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice, an inflammatory and fibrotic response was induced for three of the CNTs that had retained their long discrete struc tures, whereas the other CNT, which was less dura ble and had shorter structures and/or formed tight bundles, caused minimal inflammation. The find ings were consistent with those found for asbestos and glass wool fibers after intraperitoneal injection into mice, in which an inflammatory and fibrotic response was elicited by the two asbestos samples that were both durable and contained a high per centage of long fibers, and the glass wool fiber that was not very durable and caused only minimal in flammation.\n【116】 The physical-chemical properties (e.g., dimen sion, composition, surface characteristics) of CNT and CNF can often be modified to accommodate their intended commercial use. CNT and CNF can  be coated or functionalized, thus chang ing their surface chemistry. Toxicological effects of such changes remain largely unexplored  except for some limited evidence indi cating that structural defects , surface  and oxidative modification , nitrogen doping , surface functionalization , and polymer (acidand polystyrene-based) surface coating  of CNT can influence their toxicity po tential. Recent studies indicate that functionalization of MWCNT with -COOH groups significantly decreases the inflammatory and fibrotic response after aspiration in a mouse model  and when SWCNT were functionalized by carboxylation and subjected to phagolysosomal fluid, longitudinal splitting and oxidative degradation of the tubes occurred . Kagan  reported that in vitro myeloperoxidase, which is found in high concentrations in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), degraded SWCNT. However, it is uncer tain as to whether PMN-derived myeloperoxidase would degrade SWCNT in vivo (e.g., in the lung) because of the following:  PMN recruitment af ter SWCNT exposure is a transient rather than per sistent response,  there is no strong evidence for SWCNT phagocytosis by PMN, and  SWCNT and MWCNT are found in the lungs of mice months after pharyngeal aspiration .\n【117】 Several animal studies have shown that the size (e.g., length) of MWCNT and SWCNT may have an effect on their biological activity . Intraperitoneal injection of mice with long MWCNT (20 ^m length), but not short MWCNT ( 5 ^m in length . However, when rats were ex posed to short MWCNT (< 1 ^m length) by intra peritoneal injection, only acute inflammation was observed, with no evidence of mesothelioma over the 2 year post-exposure period . Nagai  provided evidence that the car cinogenic potential of MWCNT may be related to the fiber-like properties and dimensions. Fischer 344/Brown Norway (male and female, 6 wk old) were injected with doses of 1 or 10 mg of one of five types of MWCNT with different dimensions and rigidity. The thin diameter MWCNT (~50 nm) with high crystallinity caused inflammation and mesothelioma, whereas thick (~150 nm) or tangled structures (~2-20 nm) were less cytotoxic, inflammogenic, or carcinogenic. A specific muta tion to tumor suppressor genes (Cdkn2a/2b) was observed in the mesotheliomas, which is similar to that observed in asbestos-associated mesothe liomas induced by asbestos. In vitro studies with mesothelial cells showed that the thin MWCNT pierced cell membranes and caused cytotoxicity.\n【118】 Numerous studies have investigated the genotoxic properties of CNT with results from in vitro assays indicating that exposure to SWCNT and MWCNT can induce DNA damage, micronuclei formation, disruption of the mitotic spindle, and induction of polyploidy . Other in vitro studies of some MWCNT did not show evi dence of genotoxicity . The presence of residual metal catalysts was  found to promote the generation of reac tive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing the potential for DNA damage . The results from in vitro studies with CNF have  shown that exposure can cause genotoxicity  including aneugenic as well as clastogenic events. In addition, low-dose, long term exposure of bronchial epithelial cells to SW-CNT or MWCNT has been reported to transform these cells to exhibit unregulated proliferation, loss of contact inhibition of division, enhanced migra tion and invasion, and growth in solf agar . When SWCNT-transformed epithe lial cells were subcutaneously injected into the hind flanks of immunodeficient nude mice, small tumors were observed at one week post-injection. Histological evaluation of tumors showed classic cancer cell morphology, including the presence of multinucleated cells, an indicator of mitotic dys function .\n【119】 When CNT and CNF are suspended in test media, agglomerates of various sizes frequently occur. This is particularly evident in test media used in recent studies where animals have been exposed to CNT suspensions by intratracheal instillation, intraperito neal injection, or by pharyngeal aspiration (a tech nique where particle deposition closely resembles inhalation). The agglomerate size for CNT and CNF is normally smaller in a dry aerosol than when sus pended in physiological media. Evidence from tox icity studies in laboratory animals indicates that decreasing agglomerate size increases the pulmo nary response to exposure . The extent to which ag glomerates of CNT and CNF de-agglomerate in biological systems (e.g., in the lung) is unknown. However, a diluted alveolar lining fluid has been shown to substantially improve dispersion of CNT in physiological saline . Mice or rats exposed to SWCNT by IT or pharynge al aspiration have developed granulomatous lesions at sites in the lung where agglomerates of SWCNT deposited . In addition, interstitial fibrosis has  been reported . This fibrotic response was associated with the migration of smaller SWCNT structures into the interstitium of alveolar septa .\n【120】 3.1.1 IT Studies Lam  investigated the toxicity of SW CNT obtained from three different sources, each with different amounts of residual catalytic metals being present. Mice were exposed by IT to three different types of SWCNT (containing either 27% Fe, 2% Fe, or 26% Ni and 5% Y) at concentrations of 0.1 or 0.5 mg and to carbon black (0.5 mg) or to quartz (0.5 mg). The mice were toxicologically assessed 7 or 90 days post exposure. All types of SWCNT studied produced persistent epithelioid granulomas (which were associated with particle agglomerates) and interstitial inflammation that were dose-related. No granulomas were observed in mice exposed to carbon black, and only mild to moderate inflammation of the lungs was observed in the quartz exposure group. High mortality (5/9 mice) occurred within 4 to 7 days in mice instilled with the 0.5 mg dose of SWCNT containing nickel and yttrium. Warheit  exposed rats via IT to concen trations of 1 or 5 mg/kg SWCNT, quartz, carbonyl iron, or graphite particles, and evaluated effects at 24-hr, 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months post ex posure. The SWCNT were reported to have nomi nal diameters of 1.4 nm and lengths > 1 ^m, which tended to agglomerate into micrometer size struc tures. In this study, ~15% of the SWCNT-instilled rats died within 24 hours of SWCNT exposure, ap parently due to SWCNT blockage of the upper air ways. In the remaining rats, a transient inflamma tory response of the lung (observed up to 1-month post exposure) and non-dose dependent multifocal granulomas that were non-uniform in distribution were observed. Only rats exposed to quartz de veloped a dose-dependent lung inflammatory re sponse that persisted through 3 months. Exposures to carbonyl iron or graphite particles produced no significant adverse effects.\n【121】 # Pharyngeal Aspiration Studies\n【122】 Progressive interstitial fibrosis of alveolar walls has  been reported in mice when exposed via pharyngeal aspiration to purified SWCNT at doses of 10, 20, 40 ^g/mouse . As with studies by Lam  and Warheit , epithelioid granulomas were associated with the deposition of SWCNT agglomerates in the terminal bronchioles and proximal alveoli. This granuloma formation was rapid  of 508 m2/g. Both studies reported acute lung inflammation followed by the develop ment of granulomatous pneumonia and persistent interstitial fibrosis; these effects were observed for both purified (0.2% Fe)  and unpurified (17.7% Fe)  SWCNT. The finding that the acute lung inflam mation resolved after the end of exposure while the pulmonary fibrotic response persisted or pro gressed is unusual compared with lung responses observed from other inhaled particles. The findings indicate that the mechanism may involve the direct stimulation of fibroblasts by dispersed SWCNT that translocate to the lung interstitium . Quantitatively, mice exposed by in halation (dispersed SWCNT) were 4-fold more prone to developing an inflammatory response, interstitial collagen deposition, and fibrosis, when compared (at an estimated equivalent lung dose) with mice exposed by aspiration to a less dispersed suspension of SWCNT. The exposure of mice by inhalation of 5 mg/m3 SWCNT  is relevant, because the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permis sible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable synthetic graphite of 5 mg/m3 is sometimes used for control ling workplace exposures to CNT.\n【123】 # Inhalation Studies\n【124】 # Pharyngeal Aspiration Studies\n【125】 Exposures to well-dispersed MWCNT in mice via pharyngeal aspiration have resulted in dose-and time-dependent pulmonary inflammation , as well as central nervous system effects , at doses rang ing from 10 to 80 ^g/mouse. Exposure of mice to dispersed suspension of purified MWCNT at doses of 10, 20, 40, or 80 ^g resulted in pulmonary in flammation and damage, granulomas, and a rapid and persistent fibrotic response . Morphometric analyses indicated that the intersti tial fibrotic response was dose-dependent and pro gressed through 56 days post-exposure . There was  evidence that MWCNT can reach the pleura  and that alveo lar macrophages containing MWCNT can migrate to the lymphatics and cause lymphatic inflamma tion . Some of the MWCNT (mean diameter of 49 nm and mean length of 4.2 ^m) were observed penetrating the outer lung wall and entered the intrapleural space Mercer 2010]. Morphometric analyses indicated that 12,000 MWCNT entered the intra pleural space at 56 days post-exposure to 80 ^g of MWCNT .\n【126】 # IT Studies\n【127】 Lung inflammation and fibrosis have  been observed in rats exposed by IT to long (5.9 ^m) or short (0.7 ^m) MWCNT at doses of 0.5, 2, or 5 mg of either ground or unground MWCNT and examined up to 60 days post-exposure . Rats that received ground MWCNT (0.7 ^m) showed greater dispersion in the lungs, and fibrotic lesions were observed in the deep lungs (alveolar region). In rats treated with unground MWCNT (5.9 ^m), fibrosis appeared mainly in the airways rather than in the lung parenchyma.\n【128】 The biopersistence of the unground MWCNT was greater than that of the ground MWCNT (81% vs. 36 %). At an equal mass dose, ground MWCNT produced a similar inflammatory and fibrogenic re sponse as chrysotile asbestos and a greater response than ultrafine carbon black .\n【129】 Similar findings have been reported by Aiso , in which rats exposed to IT doses of 0.04 and 0.16 mg of dispersed MWCNT (mean length-5 ^m, diameter-88 nm) caused transient inflammation, and persistent granulomas and al veolar wall fibrosis. These acute effects have  been reported in guinea pigs at IT doses of 12.5 mg  and 15 mg ; in mice at doses of 0.05 mg (average di ameter of 50 nm, average length of 10 ^m) ], and at 5, 20, and 50 mg/kg ; and in rats  dosed at 1, 3, 5, or 7 mg (diameters of 40 to 60 nm, lengths of 0.5 to 5 |im). In contrast, Elgrabli  reported cell death but no histopathological lesions or fibrosis in rats ex posed at doses of 1, 10, or 100 ^g MWCNT (diame ters of 20 to 50 nm, lengths of 0.5 to 2 ^m). Likewise, Kobayashi  observed only transient lung inflammation and a granulomatous response in rats exposed to a dispersed suspension of MWCNT (0.04-1 mg/kg). No fibrosis was reported, but the authors did not use a collagen stain for histopathology, which would have compromised the sensitivity and specificity of their lung tissue analysis.\n【130】 In a study of rats administered MWCNT or crocidolite asbestos by intrapulmonary spraying (IPS), exposure to either material produced inflammation in the lungs and pleural cavity in addition to mesothelial proliferative lesions . Four groups of six rats each were given 0.5 ml of 500 ^g suspensions, once every other day, five times over a 9-day period and then evaluated. MWCNT and crocidolite were found to translocate from the lung to the pleural cavity after administration. MWCNT and crocidolite were  observed in the medias tinal lymph nodes suggesting that a probable route of translocation of the fibers is lymphatic flow. Analysis of tissue sections found MWCNT and crocidolite in focal granulomatous lesions in the alveoli and in alveolar macrophages.\n【131】 # Inhalation Studies\n【132】 Several short-term inhalation studies using mice or rats have been conducted to assess the pulmonary  and systemic immune effects  from exposure to MWCNT. Mitchell  report ed the results of a whole-body short-term inhalation study with mice exposed to MWCNT (diameters of 10 to 20 nm, lengths of 5 to 15 ^m) at concentra tions of 0.3, 1, or 5 mg/m3 for 7 or 14 days (6 hr/ day) (although there was some question regarding whether these structures were actually MWCNT ). Histopathology of lungs of exposed animals showed alveolar macrophages containing black particles; however, there was no observed inflammation or tissue damage. Systemic immunosuppression was observed after 14 days, al though without a clear concentration-response rela tionship. Mitchell  reported that the im munosuppression mechanism of MWCNT appears to involve a signal originating in the lungs that acti vates cyclooxygenase enzymes in the spleen. Porter  reported significant pulmonary inflam mation and damage in mice 1 day after inhalation of well-dispersed MWCNT (10 mg/m3, 5 hr/day, 2-12 days; mass aerodynamic diameter of 1.3 ^m, count aerodynamic diameter of 0.4 |im). In addition, gran ulomas were  observed encapsulating MWCNT in the terminal bronchial/proximal alveolar region of the lung. In an inhalation (nose-only) study with mice exposed to 30 mg/m3 MWCNT (lengths of 0.5 to 50 |im) for 6 hours, a high incidence (9 of10 mice) of fibrotic lesions occurred . MWCNT were found in the subpleural region of the lung 1 day post exposure, with sub pleural fibrosis occurring at 2 weeks post exposure that progressed through 6 weeks of follow-up. No fibrosis was observed in mice exposed to 1 mg/m3 of MWCNT or in mice exposed to 30 mg/m3 of na noscale carbon black.\n【133】 Subchronic inhalation studies with MWCNT have  been conducted in laboratory studies with rats to assess the potential dose-response and time course for developing pulmonary effects . Ma-Hock  reported on the results of a 90day inhalation (head-nose) study with rats exposed at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/m3 MWCNT (BASF Nanocyl NC  for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks with a resultant lung burden of 47 1170 ^g/rat. No systemic toxicity was observed, but the exposure caused hyperplastic responses in the nasal cavity and upper airways (larynx and trachea), and granulomatous inflammation in the lung and in lung-associated lymph nodes at all ex posure concentrations. The incidence and severity of the effects were concentration-related. No lung fibrosis was observed but pronounced alveolar lipoproteinosis did occur.\n【134】 Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  con ducted a short-term inhalation bioassay (before the Pauluhn 2010a subchronic study) to investi gate the dependence of pulmonary inflammation resulting from exposure to one type of MWCNT (Bayer Baytubes), which was highly agglomerated and contained a small amount of cobalt (residual catalyst). Groups of rats were exposed to 11 mg/m3 MWCNT containing either 0.53% or 0.12% cobalt to assess differences in pulmonary toxicity because of metal contamination. Another group of rats was exposed to 241 mg/m3 MWCNT (0.53% cobalt) to serve the purpose of hazard identification. All animals were exposed to a single nose-only inha lation exposure of 6 hr followed by a post-expo sure period of 3 months. Time course of MWCNTrelated pulmonary toxicity was compared with rats exposed to quartz in post-exposure weeks 1, 4, and 13 to distinguish early, possibly surface area/activityrelated effects from retention-related poorly soluble particle effects. Rats exposed to either quartz or MWCNT resulted in somewhat similar patterns of concentration-dependent pulmonary inflam mation during the early phase of the study. The pulmonary inflammation induced by quartz in creased during the 3 months post-exposure peri od, whereas that induced by MWCNT regressed in a concentration-dependent manner. The time course of pulmonary inflammation associated with retained MWCNT was independent on the concentration of residual cobalt. Pauluhn , using the same MWCNT (0.53% cobalt) used in the study by Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  exposed rats (nose-only) at concentrations 0.1, 0.4, 1.5, and 6 mg/m3 for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks. The aerosolized MWCNT were described as being high ly agglomerated (mean diameter of 3 ^m). Lung clearance of MWCNT at the low doses was slow, with a marked inhibition of clearance at 1.5 and 6 mg/m3. Histopathology analysis at 6 months post exposure revealed exposure-related lesions in the upper respiratory (e.g., goblet cell hypermetaplasia and/or metaplasia) and lower respiratory (e.g., in flammation in the bronchiole-alveolar region) tract in animals exposed at concentrations of 0.4, 1.5, and 6 mg/m3, as well as inflammatory changes in the distal nasal cavities that were similar to those found by Ma-Hock . In rats exposed at 6 mg/ m3, a time-dependent increase of bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia was observed, as well as changes in granulomas and an increase in collagen deposition that persisted through the 39-week post-exposure observation period. No treatment-related effects were reported for rats exposed at 0.1 mg/m3.\n【135】 In a report submitted by Arkema  to EPA, rats exposed (nose only) to agglomerates of MWCNT (Arkema) at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/ m3 for 6 hr/day for 5 days exhibited histopathological effects that were consistent with those reported by Ma-Hock , Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  and Pauluhn . An increase of various cytokines and chemokines in the lung, along with the development of granulomas were found in the 0.5 and 2.5 mg/m3 exposure groups, while no treatment-related effects were reported at 0.1 mg/m3.\n【136】 # . S W C N T a n d M W C N T\n【137】 I n t r a p e r i t o n e a l S t u d i e s Intraperitoneal injection studies in rodents have been frequently used as screening assays for poten tial mesotheliogenic activity in humans. To date, exposures to only a few fiber types are known to produce mesotheliomas in humans; these include the asbestos minerals and erionite fibers. Several animal studies  have been conducted to investi gate the hazard potential of various sizes and doses of MWCNT and SWCNT to cause a carcinogenic response. Takagi  reported on the in traperitoneal injection of 3 mg of MWCNT in p53 +/-mice (a tumor-sensitive, genetically engineered mouse model), in which approximately 28% of the structures were > 5 ^m in length with an average diameter of 100 nm. After 25 weeks, 88% of mice treated with MWCNT revealed moderate to severe fibrotic peritoneal adhesions, fibrotic peritoneal thickening, and a high incidence of macroscopic peritoneal tumors. Histological examination found mesothelial lesions near fibrosis and granulomas. Similar findings were  seen in the crocidolite asbestos-treated positive control mice. Minimal mesothelial reactions and no mesotheliomas were produced by the same dose of (nonfibrous) C60 fullerene. Poland  reported that the peritoneal (abdominal) injection of long MW-CNT-but not short MWCNT-induced inflam mation and granulomatous lesions on the abdomi nal side of the diaphragm at 1 week post-exposure. This study, in contrast to the Takagi  study, used wild type mice exposed to a much low er dose (50 ^g) of MWCNT. Although this study documented acute inflammation, it did not evalu ate whether this inflammation would persist and progress to mesothelioma. Murphy  found similar findings in C57BI/6 mice that were in jected with different types of MWCNT composed of different tube dimensions and characteristics (e.g., tangled) or injected with mixed-length amosite as bestos. Mice were injected with a 5 ^g dose directly into the pleural space and evaluated after 24 hours, 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Mice injected with long (> 15 ^m) MWCNT or asbestos showed significantly increased granulocytes in the pleural lavage, com pared with the vehicle control at 24 hours post ex posure. Long MWCNT caused rapid inflammation and persistent inflammation, fibrotic lesions, and mesothelial cell proliferation at the parietal pleural surface at 24 weeks post exposure. Short (< 4 ^m) and tangled MWCNT did not cause a persistent in flammatory response and were mostly cleared from the intrapleural space within 24 hours.\n【138】 A lack of a carcinogenic response was reported by Muller  and Varga and Szendi  in rats, and by Liang  in mice, follow ing intraperitoneal injection or implantation of MWCNT or SWCNT. No mesotheliomas were noted 2 years after intraperitoneal injection of MWCNT in rats at a single dose of 2 or 20 mg  or MWCNT (phosphorylcholine-grafted) in mice when given daily doses of either 10, 50, or 250 mg/kg and evaluated at day 28 . However, the MWCNT sam ples used in the Muller  and Liang  studies were very short (avg. < 1 ^m in length observed by Muller  and < 2 ^m in length observed by Liang ), and the findings were consistent with the low biological activity observed in the Poland  study when mice were exposed to short MWCNT. Varga and Szendi  reported on the implantation of either MWCNT or SWCNT in F-344 rats (six per group) at a dose of 10 mg (25 mg/kg bw). Gelatin capsules containing either SWCNT (< 2 nm diam eters x 4-15 ^m lengths), MWCNT (10-30 nm di ameters x 1-2 ^m lengths), or crystalline zinc oxide (negative control) were implanted into the perito neal cavity. Histological examination at 12 months revealed only a granulomatous reaction of foreign body type with epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells in CNT-exposed animals. No information was reported on what effect the delivery of SWCNT and MWCNT in gelatin capsules had on their disper sion in the peritoneal given the tendency of CNT to agglomerate. If SWCNT and MWCNT remained agglomerated following delivery, this may have resulted in the lack of a mesothelioma-inducing ef fect. The low biological activity observed for the short MWCNT sample (< 2 ^m) used in the study was consistent with the findings from Poland , Muller , and Liang , in which short MWCNT were  used.   reported that multiple aspirations of SWCNT (20 ^g/mouse, every 2 weeks, for 2 months) in Apo E -/-mice caused a 71% increase in aortic plaques. Inhalation of MWCNT by rats (26 mg/m3 for 5 hr; lung burden of 22 ^g) resulted in a 92% de pression of the responsiveness of coronary arte rioles to dilators 24 hr post-exposure , while aspiration of MWCNT has been shown to increase baroreflex activity in rats . Further more, pharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT (80 ^g/ mouse) results in induction of mRNA for certain inflammatory mediators and markers of blood/ brain barrier damage in the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, midbrain and hippocampus brain regions 24 hr post-exposure . Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain these systemic responses:\n【139】 # Translocation of CNT to Systemic Sites\n【140】 Translocation of intraperitoneal instilled MWCNT from the abdominal cavity to the lung has been re ported ; however, there is no evi dence that the reported systemic effects are associ ated with translocation of CNT from the lung to the affected tissue. Aspirated gold-labeled SWCNT were not found in any organ 2 weeks post-exposure . Pulmonary exposure to particles causes localized inflammation at the sites of particle deposition in the alveoli. Erdely  reported that aspira tion of SWCNT or MWCNT (40 ^g/m) induced a small but significant increase in blood neutrophils, mRNA expression, and protein levels for certain inflammatory markers in the blood at 4 hr post exposure, but not at later times. Pulmonary CNT exposure  significantly elevated gene expres sion for mediators, such as Hif -3a and S100a, in the heart and aorta at 4 hr post-exposure. Evidence  exists that pulmonary exposure to particles al ters systemic micro-vascular function by potentiat ing PMN as they flow through pulmonary capillar ies in the close proximity to affected alveoli. These potentiated blood PMN adhere to micro-vessel walls and release reactive species that scavenge NO produced by endothelial cells . Therefore, less dilator-induced NO diffuses to vascular smooth muscle resulting in less dilation.\n【141】 # . 5 C a r b o n N a n o f i b e r s ( C N F )\n【142】 Recent observations indicate that exposure to CNF can cause respiratory effects similar to those ob served in animals exposed to CNT . In this study, female mice were exposed by pharyngeal aspiration to SWCNT (40 ^g), CNF (120 ^g) or crocidolite (120 ^g) and evaluated post exposure at 1, 7, and 28 days. Delivered structure number or particle surface area at the highest doses were 1.89 x 106 and 0.042 m2 for SWCNT, 4.14 x 106 and 0.05 m2 for CNF, and 660 x 106 and 0.001 m2 for asbestos. SWCNT and CNF were purified and con tained 0.23 and 1.4% iron, respectively compared to the 18% iron of the asbestos sample. SWCNT had diameters of 1 to 4 nm and lengths ranging from 1 to 3 ^m whereas the diameters of CNF ranged from 60 to 150 nm and lengths approximately 5 to 30 ^m. The fiber lengths of asbestos ranged from 2 to 30 ^m. On a mass dose bases, inflammation and lung damage at 1 day post-exposure followed the potency sequence of SWCNT>CNF>asbestos.\n【143】 # System ic Inflam m ation\n【144】 The same potency sequence was observed for TNF and IL-6 production at 1 day post-exposure. SW CNT agglomerates were associated with the rapid (7 days) development of granulomas, while neither CNF nor asbestos (being more dispersed) caused granulomatous lesions. Interstitial fibrosis (noted as TGF production, lung collagen, and Sirius red staining of the alveolar septa) was observed at 28 days post-exposure with a mass-based potency se quence of SWCNT>CNF=asbestos. The potency sequence for fibrosis was not found to be related to structure number or particle surface area (deter mined by BET gas absorption method) delivered to the lung. However, it is likely that gas absorp tion overestimates the surface area of agglomerated SWCNT structures delivered to the lung. Estimates of effective surface area, based on geometrical anal ysis of structures including agglomeration, provid ed an improved dose metric that was correlated to the toxicological responses to CNT and CNF.\n【145】 Respiratory effects after a subchronic inhalation exposure of rats to CNF , at 2.5 mg/m3 the concentration was 56 fibers/cc with a MMAD of 3.2 ^m (GSD 2., and at 25 mg/m3 the concentration was 252 fibers/cc with a MMAD of 3.3 ^m (GSD 2.. The mean lengths and diameters of fibers were 5.8 ^m and 158 nm, respectively with surface area measurements (by BET) of 13.8 m2/g. At 1-day post exposure wet lung weights were sig nificantly elevated compared to controls in male rats at 25 mg/m3 and in female rats at 2.5 and 25 mg/m3. Small increases in inflammation of the ter minal bronchiole and alveolar duct regions were  observed in rats exposed to 2.5 mg/m3 while histopathological assessments of rats exposed at 25 mg/m3 found subacute to chronic inflamma tion of the terminal bronchiole and alveolar duct regions of the lungs along with thickening of the interstitial walls and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. No adverse histopathological findings were reported for the 0.54 mg/m3 ex posure group. After the 3-month recovery period, lung weights remained elevated in each sex in the 25 mg/m3 exposure group. Inflammation and the numbers (> 70%) of fiber-laden alveolar macro phages still persisted in the lung of rats exposed to 25 mg/m3 with the inflammatory response report ed to be relatively minor but significantly increased when compared to the non-exposed control group. Fibers were  observed to persist in the nasal turbinate's at 3-months post-exposure in all rats ex posed at 25 mg/m3 causing a nonspecific inflamma tory response. In contrast to Murray , no fibrosis was noted in this inhalation study. The most likely reason for this discrepancy is a differ ence in alveolar lung burden between the Murray  and the DeLorme  study.\n【146】 In the former, the lung burden was 120 ^g/mouse lung. In contrast, lung burden was not reported or estimated in the DeLorme  rat study. However, with a MMAD as large as 3.3 ^m, nasal filtering would be expected to be high and alveolar deposition relatively low.

Animal stud ies with CNT and CNF have shown the following:\n【149】 1. Early onset and persistent pulmonary fibrosis in SWCNT-, MWCNT-, and CNF-exposed animals in short-term and subchronic studies .\n【150】 2. Similar pulmonary responses in animals (e.g., acute lung inflammation, interstitial fibrosis) when exposed to purified and unpurified SWCNT [Lam 2004;Shvedova 2005Shvedova , 2008.\n【151】 3. Equal or greater potency of SWCNT, MWCNT, and CNF compared with other inhaled par ticles (ultrafine carbon black, crystalline silica, and asbestos) in causing adverse lung effects including pulmonary inflammation and fibro sis .\n【152】 4. CNT agglomeration affects the site of lung de position and response; large agglomerates tend to deposit at the terminal bronchioles and proximal alveoli and induce a granulomatous response, while more dispersed structures de posit in the distal alveoli and cause interstitial fibrosis . Agglomerated SWCNT tend to induce granu lomas, while more dispersed CNF and asbestos did not .\n【153】 # Intraperitoneal injection of long (> 5 ^m)\n【154】 MWCNT in mice causes fibrotic lesions and mesothelial cell proliferation .\n【155】 Although pulmonary responses to SWCNT and MWCNT are qualitatively similar, quantitative differences in pulmonary responses have been re ported. In mice exposed to CNT by pharyngeal as piration (10 ^g/mouse), SWCNT caused a greater inflammatory response than MWCNT at 1 day post exposure . Morphometric analyses indicate that well-dispersed purified SWCNT (< 0.23% iron) are not well recognized by alveolar macrophages (only 10% of the alveolar burden being within alveolar macrophages) , and that 90% of the dispersed SWCNT structures have been ob served to cross alveolar epithelial cells and enter the interstitium . In contrast, approximately 70% of MWCNT in the respiratory airways are taken up by alveolar macrophages, 8% migrate into the alveolar septa, and 22% are found in granulomatous lesions , possibly due to the greater tube count per mass of SWCNT . In addition, although both SWCNT and MWCNT have been reported in the subpleural tissue of the lung , penetration of the visceral pleura and trans location to the intrapleural space has been reported only for MWCNT . Despite these differences, CNTs of various types, both purified and unpurified, dispersed or agglomerated, all cause adverse lung effects in rats or mice at relatively low mass doses that are rele vant to potential worker exposures.\n【156】 Animal studies have  shown asbestos-type pa thology associated with the longer, straighter CNT structures . Mesothelial tumors have been reported in mice receiving intraperitoneal injection of long MWCNT (5-20 ^m in length) ; whereas chronic bioas says of short MWCNT (avg. < 1 ^m and < 2 ^m in length, respectively)  did not produce mesothelioma. These find ings are consistent with those reported by Yamashita  and Nagai  who found that MWCNT injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice or rats generated inflammation/genetic dam age and mesothelioma that were related to the di mension of the CNT. Results from these peritoneal assay studies indicate that CNT of specific dimen sions and durability can cause inflammation, fi brosis, and mesothelial tumors in mice and in rats; however, additional experimental animal research is needed to:  provide quantitative data on the biopersistence of different types of CNT in the lung and,  address the key question as to the precise dimensions (and possibly other physical-chemical characteristics) of CNT that pose a potential patho genic risk for cancer including mesothelioma.\n【157】 As synthesized, raw (unpurified) CNT, contain as much as 30% catalytic metals. Catalytic metals, such as iron-rich SWCNT, can generate hydroxyl radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and organic (lipid) peroxides , and when human epidermal keratinocytes cells are ex posed to unpurified SWCNT (in vitro cellular stud ies), oxidant injury occurs . These catalytic metals can be removed from raw CNT by acid treatment or by high temperature to yield purified CNT with low metal content. Re moval of catalytic metals abolishes the ability of SWCNT or MWCNT to generate hydroxyl radi cals. However, in laboratory animal studies the pul monary bioactivity of SWCNT does not appear to be affected by the presence or absence of catalytic metals. Lam  compared the pulmonary response of mice to intratracheal instillation of raw (containing 25% metal catalyst) with purified (~2% iron) SWCNT and found that the granulomatous reaction was not dependent on metal contamina tion. Likewise, the acute inflammatory reaction of mice after aspiration of raw (30% iron) versus puri fied (< 1% iron) SWCNT was not affected by metal content [Shvedova 2005[Shvedova , 2008.\n【158】 Pulmonary exposure to CNT have shown systemic responses including an increase in inflammatory mediators in the blood, as well as oxidant stress in aortic tissue and increase plaque formation in an atherosclerotic mouse model Erdely 2009]. Pulmonary exposure to MWCNT  depresses the ability of coronary arterioles to respond to dilators . These cardiovascular effects may be due to neurogenic signals from sensory irritant receptors in the lung. Mechanisms, such as inflammatory signals or neu rogenic pathways causing these systemic responses, are under investigation.\n【159】 Results from in vitro cellular studies have shown that SWCNT can cause genotoxicity and abnormal chromosome number, because of interference with mitosis (cell division), by disrupting the mitotic spindles in dividing cells and inducing the forma tion of anaphase bridges among the nuclei . In vitro studies  indicate that expo sure to CNF can cause genotoxicity (micronuclei) as a result of reactive oxygen species (ROS) pro duction, which in turn reacts with DNA, and by interfering physically with the DNA/chromosomes and/or mitotic apparatus . Lowdose, long-term exposure of bronchial epithelial cells to MWCNT has been shown to induce cell transformation, and these transformed cells induce tumors after injection into nude mice .\n【160】 Currently, there are no studies reported in the liter ature on the adverse health effects in workers pro ducing or using CNT or CNF. However, because humans can  develop lung inflammation and fibrosis in response to inhaled particles and fibers, it is reasonable to assume that at equivalent expo sures (e.g., lung burden/alveolar epithelial cell sur face) to CNT and CNF, workers may  be at risk of developing these adverse lung effects.\n【161】 Although data on workplace exposures to CNT and CNF are limited, aerosolization of CNT and CNF has been shown to occur at a number of operations during research, production, and use of CNT and CNF, including such work tasks as transferring, weighing, blending, and mixing. Worker exposure to airborne CNT and CNF has frequently been observed to be task-specific and short-term in du ration, with exposure concentrations (frequently reported as particle number or mass concentra tions) found to exceed background exposure mea surements when appropriate engineering controls are not used to reduce exposures . Results from stud ies  suggest that the airborne concentration and the physical-chemical characteristics of particles (e.g., discrete versus agglomerated CNT) released while handling CNT may vary significantly with production batch and work process. Comprehen sive workplace exposure evaluations are needed to characterize and quantify worker exposure to CNT and CNF at various job tasks and operations, and to determine what control measures are the most effective in reducing worker exposures.\n【162】 The findings of adverse respiratory effects (i.e., pul monary fibrosis, granulomatous inflammation) and systemic responses in animals indicate the need for protective measures to reduce the health risk to workers exposed to CNT and CNF. Available evidence  indicates that the migration of MW CNT into the intrapleural space could potentially initiate mesothelial injury and inflammation that over time cause pleural pathology, including meso thelioma. Long-term inhalation studies are needed to determine whether CNT and CNF of specific dimension and chemistry can cause cancer in laboratory animals at doses equivalent to potential workplace exposures. In addition, the potential for migration of CNT through the lungs and for accu mulation in the intrapleural space with time after inhalation requires further investigation. Until re sults from animal research studies can fully explain the mechanisms in which inhalation exposure to CNT and CNF cause adverse lung effects and pos sible systemic effects, all types of CNT and CNF should be considered an occupational respiratory hazard, and the following actions should be taken to minimize health concerns:\n【163】 1. Minimize workplace exposures.\n【164】 2. Establish an occupational health surveillance program for workers exposed to CNT and CNF (, Appendix B). NIOSH bases its recommended exposure limits (RELs) on quantitative risk assessments when pos sible. Quantitative risk assessment provides esti mates of the severity and likelihood of an adverse response associated with exposure to a hazardous substance. The hazard and quantitative risk assess ments ( and Appendix A) provide the health basis for developing a recommended expo sure limit (REL) for CNT and CNF. Establishing health-based exposure limits is the first consider ation by NIOSH in setting a REL. The analytical feasibility of measuring worker exposures to air borne CNT and CNF is  taken into account in the establishment of the REL .\n【165】 In general, quantitative risk assessment involves the following steps: first a data set is selected that best depicts a dose-response relationship, in this case, the relationship between exposure to CNT and pulmonary effects in animals. Then, a critical dose in the animal lungs is calculated. A frequently used indicator of critical dose is the benchmark dose (BMD) which is defined as the dose corre sponding to a small increase in response (e.g. 10%) over the background level of response . Next, the dose in humans, that is equivalent to the critical dose in the animals, is estimated. This requires adjusting for species differences between animals and humans. It is assumed in the absence of specific data that an equivalent dose in animals and humans will result in the same risk of disease, based on the assumption that the same mechanism of action is operating in both animals and humans. After the critical average dose in human lungs is estimated from the animal data, an equivalent workplace concentration over a full working life time is derived. This is accomplished by using mathematical and physiological models to estimate the fraction of the dose that reaches various parts of the respiratory tract and is deposited and cleared . Variability in human dose and response, including sensitive subpopulations, and uncertain ty in the extrapolating animal data to humans are typically addressed with uncertainty factors in the absence of specific data.\n【166】 NIOSH determined that the best data to use for a quantitative risk assessment and as the basis for a REL were the nonmalignant pulmonary data from short-term and subchonic animal studies. In these studies, lung exposures to CNT (i.e., various types of MWCNT and SWCNT, purified and unpurified, dispersed or agglomerated, and with different metal content) were observed to cause early-stage adverse lung effects including, pulmonary inflammation, granuloma, alveolar septal thickening, and pulmo nary fibrosis ( and Appendix A). NIOSH considers these animal lung effects to be relevant to workers because similar lung effects have  been observed in workers with occupational lung disease associated with exposure to various types of inhaled particles and fibers . Human-equivalent risk estimates were derived from animal dose-response data (in rats and mice). Human-equivalent expo sures over a 45-year working lifetime were estimat ed to be associated with either a specified risk level (e.g., 10%) of early-stage lung effects or with a no observed adverse effect level based on the animal studies. In the absence of validated lung dosimetry models for CNT, lung doses were estimated using spherical particle-based models and CNT airborne size data, assuming either deposited or retained lung dose in animals or humans.\n【167】 The findings from this analysis indicate that work ers are potentially at risk of developing adverse lung effects if exposed to airborne CNT during a 45-year working lifetime.  Minimal lung effects (grade 1 or higher) 0.5 to 4 ^g/m3 0.2 to 2 ^g/m3\n【168】 Slight or mild lung effects (grade 2 or higher) 1 to 44 ^g/m3 0.7 to 19 ^g/m3 Abbreviation: TWA=Time-weighted average. *Excess (exposure-attributable) risk during a 45-year working lifetime. tHistopathology findings of granulomatous inflammation  or alveolar septal thickening  in rat subchronic inhalation studies of multiwall carbon nanotubes.

Estimates vary by rat study and lung burden estimation method (Appendix A, Tables A-7 and A-.\n【170】 A-. Risk estimates derived from other animal studies  (Appendix C). Among the uncertainties in this risk assessment using animal data, there is uncertainty in extrapo lating the respiratory effects observed in short term or subchronic animal studies to estimate the probability of chronic respiratory effects in humans. In the absence of chronic data, these ani mal studies provide the best available information to derive initial estimates of health risk for use in REL development. Subchronic (13 wk.) exposure studies are a standard toxicity assay used in human health risk assessment, although the studies with shorter exposure and post-exposure durations  provide useful information about the relationship between CNT lung dose and response. To the ex tent that the precursor effects to chronic disease are observed in these shorter-term studies, the hazard and risk estimates would be expected to provide useful information for chronic disease prediction and prevention. Although there is uncertainty in the benchmark dose estimates from the subchronic studies because of the dose-spacing and high re sponse proportions, these estimates are similar to the NOAEL and LOAEL values reported in these studies  .\n【171】 One of the measures of pulmonary fibrosis used in the shorter-term studies -alveolar epithelial cell thickness (due to collagen deposition)-was previously used in the U.S. EPA ozone standard. This biological response was selected by EPA as the adverse lung response for cross-species doseresponse extrapolation because it indicates \"fun damental structural remodeling\" .\n【172】 Some of these studies provide data comparing the potency of CNT with that of other particles or fibers for which animal and human data are available on the long-term adverse health effects. These studies show that on a mass basis, CNT had equal or greater potency (pulmonary inflammation or fibrosis re sponse at a given mass dose) to that of ultrafine car bon black, crystalline silica, or chrysotile asbestos . These comparative toxicity findings between CNT and other well-studied particles or fibers help to reduce the uncertainty about whether the lung effects in these short-term studies are relevant to evaluating the chronic respiratory hazard of CNT.    Based on currently available data, it is difficult to as sess the relative toxicity of the various types of CNT and CNF because there has been limited systematic study of various CNT and CNF using the same study design. These available studies differ in factors that include the rodent species and strain, the techniques and assays for measuring lung effects, and the expo sure and post-exposure durations. Despite differences in the type and composition of SWCNT and MWCNT used in the animal studies, the risk estimates across the different types of CNT and studies are associated with relatively low mass exposure concentrations. Although data from laboratory animal studies with CNF are limited, the similarities in physical-chemical properties and adverse lung effects between CNF and CNT support the need to control exposures to CNF at the REL derived for CNT.\n【173】 NIOSH is recommending an occupational expo sure limit for CNT and CNF to minimize the risk of developing adverse lung effects over a working lifetime. A mass-based airborne exposure limit is being recommended because this exposure metric is the same as that used in determining the dose-response relationship in animal studies and deriving the risk estimates, as well as being the most com mon exposure metric currently used in monitoring workplace exposures to CNT and CNF. The REL is based on the respirable particle-size fraction be cause the adverse lung effects in the animal stud ies were observed in the alveolar (gas-exchange) region. \"Respirable\" is defined as the aerodynamic size of particles that, when inhaled, are capable of depositing in the alveolar region of the lungs . Sampling methods have been devel oped to estimate the airborne mass concentration of respirable particles   One of the earliest OELs for CNT was proposed by the British Standards Institute -the benchmark exposure limit (BEL) of 0.01 fiber/cm3, or one-tenth of their asbestos exposure limit (-. Nanocyl  derived an estimated OEL of 2.5 Mg/m3 for an 8-hr TWA exposure based on applying an overall assessment (a.k.a. uncertainty) factor of 40 to the LOAEL of 0.1 mg/m3 in the Ma-Hock  subchronic rat inhalation study of MWCNT. Aschberger  pro posed OELs of 1 Mg/m3 for MWCNT studied by Ma-Hock  and 2 Mg/m3 for MWCNT from Pauluhn , by adjusting 0.1 mg/m3 (the LOAEL in Ma-Hock  and the NOAEL in Pauluhn ) for rat-to-human daily expo sure and respiratory volume, and applying an over all assessment factor of 50 and 25, respectively.\n【174】 Pauluhn  derived an OEL using subchronic data in rats inhaling MWCNTs (Baytubes) . This approach was based on the bio logical mechanism of volumetric overloading of al veolar macrophage-mediated clearance of particles from the lungs of rats . Increased particle retention half-time (an indication of lung clearance overload) was reported in rats exposed by subchronic inhalation to MWCNT (Baytubes) at 0.1, 0.4, 2.5, or 6 mg/m3 The overloading of rat lung clearance was observed at lower-mass doses of MWCNT (Baytubes) compared with other poorly soluble particles; and the particle volume dose was better correlated with retention half-time among poorly soluble particles including CNT . Pauluhn  reported benchmark concentration (BMC) estimates of 0.16 to 0.78 mg/ m3 for rat lung responses of pulmonary inflamma tion and increased collagen, but selected the lower NOAEL of 0.1 mg/m3 to derive a human-equivalent concentration. The NOAEL was adjusted for hu man and rat differences in factors affecting the estimated particle lung dose (i.e., ventilation rate, alveolar deposition fraction, retention kinetics, and total alveolar macrophage cell volume in each spe cies). The product of these ratios resulted in a final factor of 2, by which the rat NOAEL was divided, to arrive at a human-equivalent concentration of 0.05 mg/m3 (8-hr TWA) as the OEL for MWCNT (Baytubes). No uncertainty factors were used in deriving that estimate.\n【175】 The Japanese National Institute of Advance Indus trial Science and Technology (AIST) derived an OEL for CNT of 30 Mg/m3 , based on studies supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan. Rat NOAELs for pulmonary inflammation were identified in 4-week inhala tion studies of SWCNT and MWCNT . Human-equivalent NOAELs were estimated by accounting for rat and human differ ences in exposure duration, ventilation rate, particle deposition fraction, and body weight . The rat NOAELs of 0.13 and 0.37 mg/m3 for SWCNT and MWCNT, respectively, were estimated to be equivalent to 0.03 and 0.08 mg/m3 in humans including adjustment by an uncertainty factor of 6. This total uncertainty factor included a fac tor of 2 for uncertainty in subchronic-to-chronic extrapolation and a factor of 3 for uncertainty in rat to human toxicokinetic differences (factors of 1 were assumed for toxicodynamic differences in rats and humans and for worker inter-individual vari ability). A relationship was reported between the BET specific surface area of various types of CNT and pulmonary inflammation (percent neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid)\n【176】 (Figure V.2 in Na kanishi\n【177】 ). Thus, the OEL of 0.03 mg/m3 was proposed for all types of CNT, based on the data for the SWCNT with the relatively high specific sur face area of ~1,000 m2/g (which was noted would be more protective for other CNTs with lower spe cific surface area). A period-limited (15-yr) OEL was proposed due to uncertainty in chronic effects and based on the premise that the results will be re viewed again within that timeframe with further data .\n【178】 In summary, these currently proposed OELs for CNT range from 1 to 50 Mg/m3 (8-hr TWA con centration) , including the NIOSH REL of 1 Mg/m3. Despite the differences in risk assessment methods and assumptions, all of the derived OELs for CNT are low airborne mass concentrations relative to OELs for larger respirable carbon-based particles. For example, the cur rent U.S. OELs for graphite or carbon black are ap proximately 2.5 to 5 mg/m3. Each of these CNT risk assessments supports the need to control exposures to CNT in the workplace to low airborne mass con centrations (Mg/m to protect workers' health. Nanocyl  2.5 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA) for MWCNT Adjusted rat LOAEL of 0.1 mg/m3 (subchronic inhalation)  to workers and applied assessment factor of 40.  Animal data have been used to evaluate the health hazard and risk of occupational exposure to CNT and CNF. Limited human exposure data are avail able, and NIOSH is not aware of any studies or re ports at this time of any adverse health effects in workers producing or using CNT or CNF. The best available scientific information to develop recom mended exposure limits is from the subchronic (13-wk) animal inhalation studies of two types of MWCNT and the shorter-term animal studies of SWCNT and other types of MWCNT.\n【179】 The analysis of animal data in this risk assessment includes:  identifying the adverse health effects that are associated with exposure to CNT or CNF in laboratory animals;\n【180】 evaluating the severity of the response and the relevance to humans; and  estimating the human-equivalent dose and likeli hood (risk) of adverse effects in workers. Ideally, sufficient evidence is desired to derive exposure limits that are estimated to be associated with es sentially a zero risk of an adverse health effect even if exposed 8 hr/d, 40 hr/wk. over a 45-yr working lifetime. However, limitations in the scientific data result in uncertainties about those hazards and risk estimates. Characterizing the degree of that uncer tainty, and the extent to which use of those data are useful for occupational health risk management decision-making, is an important step in risk as sessment. Alternative models and methods con tribute to the differences in the risk estimates, and there is uncertainty about which biological end points, animal models, and interspecies and dose rate extrapolation methods may be most predictive of possible human health outcomes. These uncertainties can result in either under-esti mation or over-estimation of the true health risk to workers at a given exposure scenario. Each of these areas is discussed further below.\n【181】 # Major Areas of Uncertainty  Lung response and severity level\n【182】 The REL is based on estimates of excess risk of earlystage noncancer lung effects, which NIOSH has de termined are relevant to human health risk assess ment . The extent to which these lung responses would be associated with functional deficits in animals or clinically significant effects in humans is uncertain. However, these lung responses include early onset fibrosis which persisted or pro gressed after the end of exposure .\n【183】 Limited evidence in animals suggests that these effects may be associated with some lung function decrement (reduced breathing rate in mice) . A quantitative measure of pul monary fibrosis-alveolar interstitial (septal, or connective tissue) thickening [Shvedova 2005[Shvedova , 2008 (\n【184】 #  Dose rate and retention\n【185】 Appendix A-6 provides some analyses to show the quantitative influence of dose rate and lung reten tion assumptions on the risk estimates and REL derivation . The lung effects were assumed to be associated with the total lung dose, regardless of the dose rate. If the average daily deposited lung dose is assumed (i.e., no difference in rat or human clearance rates), then the human-equivalent concentration would be ~30 times higher than that based on the ICRP  clearance model, and ~10 times higher than that assuming simple first-order kinetics . The human-equivalent working lifetime (8-hr TWA) estimates based on deposited lung dose (assuming no clearance) are lower by a factor of ~5-7 than those estimates based on retained lung burden (assuming normal clearance) .\n【186】 #  Inter-species dose normalization\n【187】 Alternative assumptions about the biologicallyrelevant measure of equivalent dose can result in considerable differences in the human-equivalent dose. NIOSH normalized the inter-species lung dose based on the ratio of the human-to-animal average alveolar surface area. Alternatively, Pauluhn  normalized the dose from rat to humans based on the average total alveolar macrophage cell volume. This difference resulted in a factor of ~4 in the humanequivalent lung burdens and working lifetime 8-hr TWA concentration estimates .\n【188】 Low dose extrapolation\n【189】 # Minor Areas of Uncertainty\n【190】 Effect level estimation\n【191】 An effect level is a dose associated with a speci fied effect (or lack of observed effect). A BMD is a statistical estimate of an effect level . Among the various studies and routes of exposure , no clear differences in exposure and risk estimates are seen for route of exposure (versus variability due to other differenc es among studies).\n【192】 In the absence of CNT-specific lung models, stan dard rat and human lung dosimetry models were used to estimate either the deposited or the retained lung dose. These two estimates are considered to represent the upper or lower bounds on the pos sible lung burden estimates. The effect of assum ing deposited dose (no clearance) versus retained\n【193】 ( R a t lu n g dose e s tim a tio n dose (normal clearance) resulted in a difference of approximately five-fold. However, the actual es timates are expected to lie within this range. The working lifetime exposure estimates (associated with 10% excess risk of early stage lung effects) were lower based on deposited dose estimates than those based on retained dose estimates (Appendix A, Table A-.  An important first step in applying any strategy is to develop an inventory of the processes and job activities (e.g., handling of dry powders, use of composite materials) that place workers at risk of exposure. This inventory can be used to determine the number of workers potentially exposed and a qualitative assessment as to the workers and pro cesses with the highest potential for exposure.\n【194】 The strategy should  incorporate provisions to quantify the airborne release of CNT and CNF oc curring at specific processes or job activities to pro vide \"activity pattern data\" .\n【195】 Activity pattern data are useful for identifying possible causes of high exposure for remediation; however, these data are vulnerable to spatial varia tion in exposure concentrations and should not be used in predicting worker exposures. For example, in the study by Birch , personal expo sure to CNF was much higher than area samples, depending on location. Respirable EC exposure for two employees working mainly in a thermal treat ment area was approximately 45 ^g/m3, and a CNF reactor area was about 80 ^g/m3, while the corre sponding area samples were about 32 ^g/m3 in the thermal treatment area and 13 ^g/m3 in the CNF reactor area. The EC concentration in the reactor area was less than half that in the thermal treat ment area, but the personal sample collected in the reactor area was nearly twice as high. Because area samples are often not predictive of personal exposure, extrapolating personal exposure from area concentrations should not be done without a thorough assessment of the workplace to estab lish whether a valid extrapolation is possible . NIOSH  and others  have developed exposure as sessment guidance for determining the release of engineered nanoparticles that can be adapted for determining sources of exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【196】 To ensure that worker exposure to CNT or CNF is being maintained below the REL, several exposure measurement strategies are available . These strategies can be tailored to the specific workplace depending on the number of workers, complexity of the work environment (e.g., process type and rate of operation, exposure control methods, physical state and properties of material) and available resources. One approach for determining worker exposure would be to ini tially target similarly exposed groups of workers . This initial sampling effort may be more time ef ficient and require fewer resources for identifying workers with exposures to CNT or CNF above the REL. However, this measurement strategy may produce incomplete and upwardly biased expo sure estimates if the exposures are highly variable . Therefore, repeated measure ments on randomly selected workers may be re quired to account for between-and within-worker variation in exposure concentrations . Because there is no 'best' exposure measurement strategy that can be applied to all workplaces, multi-day random sampling of workers (all workers, if the exposed workforce is small) may be required to have an accurate assess ment of worker airborne exposure concentrations to CNT and CNF.\n【197】 # CNT and CNF M easurem ent\n【198】 A multi-tiered exposure measurement strategy is recommended for determining worker exposure to CNT and CNF  -. The selection of workers and the frequency in which they should be sampled should follow guidelines established for the exposure monitoring program (1.. Ini tially, more samples may be required to characterize the workplace thoroughly. This initial assessment will help refine the sampling approach and deter mine whether EC interference is an issue. Careful consideration of environmental background is es sential. For example, outdoor EC may sometimes be higher than indoor background depending on the facility's air handling system. If so, the indoor EC background may be more representative of area and worker samples.\n【199】 In workplaces where exposure to other types of EC (e.g., diesel soot, carbon black) may occur, the ini tial evaluation of a worker's exposure should include the simultaneous collection of a personal respirable EC sample and a personal sample for electron mi croscopy analysis (e.g., TEM, SEM). Electron mi croscopy analysis, in conjunction with energy dis persive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), can be used for CNT and CNF identification. In addition, consider ation should be given to the sizing and counting of CNT and CNF structures during electron micros copy analysis should future efforts to control occu pational exposures be based on a different exposure metric (e.g., number concentrations of airborne CNT and CNF structures in a given size bin). While no specific electron microscopy (e.g., TEM, SEM) method exists for the sizing and counting of CNT and CNF structures, methods used in the analysis of other 'fibrous' materials are available [NIOSH 1994a;ISO 1999ISO , 2002 and could be adapted in the characterization of exposures.\n【200】 NIOSH investigators have conducted a number of surveys at CNT and CNF producers and/or secondary users [Evans 2010;Birch 2011a;Birch 2011b;Dahm 2011\n【201】 # M ethod 5040 Limit of Detection\n【202】 As with all analytical methods, the LOD is a vary ing number. However, the airborne EC LOD origi nally reported for NIOSH Method 5040 (i.e., about 2 ^g/m, or an LOQ of 7 ^g/m3 was a high estimate . The LOD was based on analysis of pre-cleaned media blanks from different filter lots, during a 6-month period, and by different analysts at two different laboratories. Further, variability for the total carbon (TC) results was used to estimate the LOD rather than EC results. These combined factors gave a conservative (high) estimate of the EC LOD.\n【203】 In practice, a much lower EC LOD is obtained by NIOSH Method 5040 than was originally reported, because the variability for EC results for a set of media blanks submitted (with the sample set) for the LOD (LOQ) determination is much lower than reported for the total carbon (TC) results. Thus, if EC is of primary interest, as with CNT/CNF measurement, and the level of organic carbon (OC) contamination is acceptable (with respect to the OC and TC LOD), EC results for as-received filters should be used to determine the EC LOD (Appendix C).\n【204】 Estimates of the EC LODs and LOQs (in units EC/cm2 of air) determined with 25-mm and 37-mm quartz filter media from a given lot, and with manual splits assigned are reported in      As stated on previous page, NIOSH Method 5040 LOD depends on the air volume, filter size, sample portion analyzed (usually 1.5 cm, and the media blank variability. The latter is used to determine the LOD in unit's ^g/cm2. Expressed as an air concen tration, the EC LOD (^g/m corresponding to the EC LOD (^g/cm determined with media blanks (i.e., LOD = 3 times the standard deviation for the blanks) can be calculated by the following equation:\n【205】 EC LOD (figfm ) = EC LOD (ptgfcm ^ ) x deposit area fa n ^ J\n【206】 This equation explains why a lower LOD (^g/m can be obtained by reducing the filter size (deposit area), increasing the air volume, and minimizing the variability for the media blanks (i.e., the EC LOD in ^g/cm. The LOD is improved using a smaller filter size since the deposit density is higher for an equivalent mass deposited. The same ap plies to the LOQ, commonly defined as 10 times the standard deviation (SD) for the blanks, or 3.3 times the LOD.\n【207】 If 0.02 ^g EC/cm2 is taken as the SD for media blanks (with manual OC-EC split adjustment), the LODs and LOQs (in ^g EC/m for different air volumes, 25-mm and 37-mm filters, and a 1.5 cm2 filter portion analyzed would be as listed in -4. Results for a SD double this value (i.e., SD = 0.04 ^g EC/cm  are reported as worst-case estimates, but are seldom this high. If SDs for media blanks are frequently above 0.02 ug EC/cm the cause of the high blank variability should be identified and corrected.\n【208】 Based on EC results for media blanks , a filter loading of about 0.3 ^g/cm2 (i.e., at or above the EC LOQs reported in Tables 6-1 and 6- will provide quantitative results.\n【209】 As described above (6.1., higher flow rate respirable samplers (cyclones) with a 25 mm cassette can improve the sample collection to permit measurement of CNT and CNF above the LOQ (i.e., 1 ^g/m for samples collected for less than full work shift. Examples of sampling periods and flow rates that provide air volumes of about a halfcubic meter or higher (shaded area in table below) are listed in -5. A larger filter portion  can be used to further lower the LOD, but the in strument's small (quartz tube) oven and need for proper sample alignment limit the amount of sam ple that can be analyzed.\n【210】 # . 3 W o r k e r E d u c a t i o n a n d T r a i n i n g\n【211】 Establishing a program that includes the education and training of workers on the potential hazards of CNT and CNF and their safe handling is critical to preventing adverse health effects from exposure.\n【212】 Research has shown that training can attain imme diate and long-term objectives when  workers are educated about the potential hazards of their job,  there are improvements in knowledge and work practices,  workers are provided the neces sary skills to perform their job safely, and  there Hoods can be tailored to the process or work task to optimize the capture of emissions.\n【213】 Usually requires less overall exhaust airflow rates than dilution ventilation systems.\n【214】 Air volumes and face velocity of LEV must be maintained to ensure the capture of emissions.\n【215】 Workers must be trained in the correct use.\n【216】 Fume hood sash opening needs to be adjusted to ensure proper hood face velocity.\n【217】 System exhaust flow rate may need careful evaluation to ensure adequate capture while minimizing loss of product.\n【218】 # C. Down flow booths\n【219】 Small room or enclosure with low velocity (100 ft/min) downward airflow to push/pull contaminants away from the worker' s breathing zone.\n【220】 Emissions pushed away from the worker' s breathing zone.\n【221】 Flexible control that can be used for several tasks/operations.\n【222】 Useful for manual operations for which a more contained enclosure is not feasible (e.g., larger amounts of materials or equipment).\n【223】 Air volumes and control velocities of booth must be monitored/maintained to ensure proper performance.\n【224】 Worker technique and interface with the work process can interfere with the capture of emissions.\n【225】 Workers must be trained in the correct use.\n【226】 (Continued)  A program for educating workers should  in clude both instruction and \"hands-on\" training that addresses the following:\n【227】 - The potential health risks associated with ex posure to CNT and CNF.\n【228】 - The safe handling of CNT, CNF, and CNTand CNF-containing materials to minimize the likelihood of inhalation exposure and skin contact, including the proper use of engineering controls, PPE (e.g., respirators, gloves), and good work practices.\n【229】 # . 4 C l e a n u p a n d D i s p o s a l\n【230】 Procedures should be developed to protect workers from exposure to CNT and CNF during the cleanup of CNT and CNF spills and CNT-or CNF-contaminated surfaces. Inhalation and dermal exposures will likely present the greatest risks. The potential for in halation exposure during cleanup will be influenced by the likelihood of CNT and CNF becoming air borne, with bulk CNT and CNF (powder form) presenting a greater inhalation potential than CNT and CNF in solution (liquid form), and liquids in turn presenting a greater potential risk than CNTand CNF-encapsulated materials.\n【231】 It would be prudent to base strategies for dealing with spills and contaminated surfaces on the use of current good practices, together with available in formation on exposure risks. Given the limited amount of data on dermal expo sure to CNT and CNF, it would be prudent to wear protective clothing and gloves when - all technical measures to eliminate or con trol the release of exposure to CNT and CNF have not been successful, or\n【232】 - in emergencies.\n【233】 If protective clothing and/or gloves are worn, particular attention should be given to prevent ing CNT and CNF exposure to abraded or lacer ated skin. Based on limited experimental evidence, airtight fabrics made of nonwoven textile seem to be more efficient in protecting workers against nanoparticles than fabrics made of woven cotton or polyester . The results of a study designed to evaluate the penetration of nano-and submicron particle penetration through various nonwoven fabrics found minimal penetration (< 5%) of iron oxide particles (< 100 nm) through nonwoven fabrics typically used for hospital frocks, hoodless cover alls, and firefighter ensemble insulation . The challenge when selecting appropriate protective apparel is to strike a balance between comfort and protection. Garments that provide the highest level of protection (e.g., an impermeable Level A suit) are  the least comfortable to wear for long periods of time, while garments that are probably the least protective (e.g., thin cotton lab coat) are the most breathable and comfortable to wear. The efficiency of commercial gloves to pre vent dermal exposure to nanoparticles varies de pending on the glove material, its thickness, and the manner in which it is used (e.g., long exposure times, other chemical exposures) , and the presence of other workplace aerosols. Based on this information, the respirator program manager may decide to choose a respirator with a higher assigned protection factor (APF) or choose a respirator with a higher level of filtration performance (e.g., changing from an N95 to a P. Studies on the filtration performance of N-95 filtering facepiece respirators have found that the mean penetration levels for 40 nm particles range from 1.4% to 5.2%, indicating that 95 and higher performing respira tor filters would be effective at capturing airborne CNT and CNF [Balazy 2006;Rengasamy 2007Rengasamy , 2008. Recent studies  show that nanoparticles <20 nm are  effectively captured by NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators as predicted by the single fiber theory [Rengasamy 2008[Rengasamy , 2009.\n【234】 # . 7 M e d i c a l S c r e e n i n g a n d S u r v e i l l a n c e\n【235】 The toxicological evidence summarized in this document leads to the conclusion that workers oc cupationally exposed to CNT and CNF may be at risk of adverse respiratory effects. These workers may benefit from inclusion in a medical screening and surveillance program recommended to help protect their health (- .\n【236】 # Worker Participation\n【237】 Workers who could receive the greatest benefit from medical screening include the following:\n【238】 - Workers exposed to concentrations of CNT or CNF in excess of the REL (i.e., workers ex posed to airborne CNT or CNF at concentra tions above 1 Mg/m3 EC as an 8-hr TWA).\n【239】 # Program Oversight\n【240】 Oversight of the medical surveillance program should be assigned to a qualified health-care profes sional who is informed and knowledgeable about potential workplace exposures, routes of exposure, and potential health effects related to CNT and CNF.\n【241】 # Screening Elements\n【242】 # I n i t ia l e v a lu a t i o n\n【243】 - An initial (baseline) evaluation should be conducted by a qualified health professional and should consist of the following:\n【244】 -An occupational and medical history with respiratory symptoms assessed by use of a standardized questionnaire such as the American Thoracic Society Respi ratory Questionnaire , or the most recent equivalent.\n【245】 -A physical examination with an empha sis on the respiratory system. -An occupational and medical history up date, including a respiratory symptom up date, and focused physical examinationperformed annually.\n【246】 -Spirometry testing less frequently than every 3 years is not recommended  -Consideration of specific medical tests (e.g., chest X-ray).\n【247】 # W r i t t e n r e p o r t s o f m e d ic a l f in d in g s\n【248】 - The health-care professional should give each worker a written report containing the following:\n【249】 -The individual worker's medical exami nation results.\n【250】 -Medical opinions and/or recommenda tions concerning any relationships be tween the individual worker's medical conditions and occupational exposures, any special instructions on the individ ual's exposures and/or use of personal protective equipment, and any further evaluation or treatment.\n【251】 - For each examined employee, the health-care professional should give the employer a writ ten report specifying the following:\n【252】 -Any work or exposure restrictions based on the results of medical evaluations.\n【253】 -Any recommendations concerning use of personal protective equipment.\n【254】 -A medical opinion as to whether any of the worker's medical conditions is likely to have been caused or aggravated by oc cupational exposures.\n【255】 - Findings from the medical evaluations hav ing no bearing on the worker's ability to work with CNT and CNF should not be included in any reports to employers. Confidentiality of the worker's medical records should be en forced in accordance with all applicable regu lations and guidelines.\n【256】 # Worker Education\n【257】 Workers should be provided information suffi cient to allow them to understand the nature of potential workplace exposures, routes of exposure, and instructions for reporting health symptoms.\n【258】 Workers should  be given information about the purposes of medical screening, the health ben efits of the program, and the procedures involved.\n【259】 # Periodic Evaluation of Data and Surveillance Program\n【260】 Standardized medical screening data should be pe riodically aggregated and evaluated to identify pat terns of worker health that may be linked to work activities and practices that require additional pri mary prevention efforts . This analysis should be performed by a qualified health-care professional or other knowledgeable person to identify patterns of worker health that may be linked to work activities or exposures. Con fidentiality of worker's medical records should be enforced in accordance with all applicable regula tions and guidelines.\n【261】 Employers should periodically evaluate the ele ments of the medical screening program to ensure that the program is consistent with current knowl edge related to exposures and health effects associ ated with occupational exposure to CNT and CNF.\n【262】 Other im portant components related to occupa tional health surveillance programs, including medical surveillance and screening, are discussed in Appendix B.\n【263】 # R e s e a r c h N e e d s\n【264】 Additional data and information are needed to as sist NIOSH in evaluating the occupational safety and health concerns of working with CNT and CNF. Data are particularly needed on workplace exposures to CNT and CNF, as well as information on whether in-place exposure control measures (e.g., engineering controls) and work practices are effective in reducing worker exposures. Additional assessment of NIOSH Method 5040 is needed to better understand potential interferences or other method limitations, improve the sensitivity and precision of the analytical method, and establish validity through the use of reference materials. The conduct of experimental animal studies with various types of CNT and CNF would help to ex plain potential mechanisms of toxicity and would provide a better understanding of the exposure pa rameters (e.g., mass, fiber/structure number, and particle size) that best describe the toxicological re sponses. Chronic studies in animals are needed to better estimate the long-term risks of lung disease in workers.\n【265】 The following types of information and research are needed: - Evaluate NIOSH Method 5040 and other ap propriate sampling and analytical methods in CNT and CNF workplaces. For example, validate Method 5040 against EC reference material and ruggedize against several CNT and CNF types.\n【266】 - Improve the sensitivity and precision of NIOSH Method 5040 and other appropriate methods for measuring airborne concentrations of CNT and CNF, including those based on metrics that may be more closely associated with the potential adverse effects (e.g., electron microscopy-based CNT or CNF structure counts).\n【267】 - Develop improved sampling and analytical methods for measuring airborne exposures to CNT and CNF.

Risk assessment is a process that uses stan dardized tools and procedures to characterize the health risk of exposure to a hazardous substance, as well as the uncertainties associated with those risk estimates. Research studies in toxicology, epide miology, exposure measurement, and other areas provide the data needed to perform the risk assess ment. The standard risk assessment paradigm in the United States includes four basic steps: hazard assessment, exposure assessment, dose-response analysis, and risk characterization . The most recent guidance  recommends asking these questions: \"What are the options avail able to reduce the hazards or exposures that have been identified, and how can risk assessment be used to evaluate the merits of the various options?\" Risk assessment is intended to provide information needed to determine risk management options.\n【287】 Risk assessment practice seeks to use the best avail able data and scientific methods as the basis for public and occupational health decision-making . When sufficient dose-response data are available (e.g., from animal studies), quantita tive risk assessment can be performed. Quantita tive risk assessment provides estimates of the sever ity and likelihood of an adverse response associated with exposure to a hazardous agent . Risk assessments are used in developing occupational exposure limits and in selecting and evaluating the effectiveness of expo sure controls and other risk management strategies to protect workers' health.\n【288】 The best data available for risk assessment, in the absence of epidemiological studies of workers pro ducing or using CNT, are from animal studies with CNT. These studies include two subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT in rats and several short-term studies of SWCNT, MWCNT, or CNF in rats or mice. These studies provide the data and information on the dose-response relationships and the biological mechanisms of early-stage in flammatory and fibrotic lung effects from expo sure to CNT. No chronic animal studies of CNT were available for this risk assessment.\n【289】 The biological mode of action for CNT and CNF, as for inhaled particles and fibers, generally relates to their physical and chemical properties. These prop erties inclu\n【290】 Dose metrics that have been associated with lung responses to CNT or CNF in animal studies include mass, volume, number, and surface area. The CNT volume dose was associated with the overloading of CNT clearance from rat lungs and to the lung re sponses . The specific surface area (m2/g) dose of various types of CNTs was associ ated with the pulmonary inflammation response in rats . Mercer  found that the effective surface area (estimated from the geometry of the structures observed by electron microscopy) was more closely associated with the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice.\n【291】 In addition to exhibiting some of the same phys ical-chemical properties of other poorly-soluble particles and/or fibers, the nanoscale structure of CNT and CNF may relate to more specific biologi cal modes (or mechanisms) of action. For example, evidence in vitro suggests that disperse CNT may act as a basement membrane, which enhances fi broblast proliferation and collagen production . This mechanism is consistent with the observation in mice of the rapid onset of diffuse interstitial fibrosis, which progressed in the absence of persistent inflammation, following ex posure to SWCNT or MWCNT by pharyngeal as piration . As fibrosis progresses, it causes thickening of the alveolar septal air/blood barrier, which can result in a decrease of gas-exchange between lung and blood .\n【292】 The focus of this quantitative risk assessment is on the early-stage noncancer lung responses (fibrotic and in flammatory) from studies in rats and mice, for which dose-response data are available. These responses are relevant to humans as observed in workers in dusty jobs . Dose-response relationships are based on mass dose, because the mass of CNT and CNF was associated with lung responses in all of the animal studies and because it is the metric typically used to measure air borne exposure in the workplace ( and Ap pendix C). The evidence for cancer effects from CNT and CNF ( and  is insufficient for quantita tive risk assessment, and may  depend on specific types of CNT or CNF structures .\n【293】 # A.2 Methods\n【294】 NIOSH used dose-response data from subchronic and short-term studies in rats and mice exposed to SWCNT or MWCNT to estimate the lung doses as sociated with early-stage inflammatory and fibrotic lung responses. Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling . It is preferable to have data with one or more doses near the bench mark response (e.g., 10%) ; howev er, in some studies the response proportions were quite high at each dose (e.g., 30-100%) . In ad dition, one study  had only one dose group in addition to the control, but the study was included because it is the only animal in halation study for SWCNT currently available and it provides a useful comparison by route of exposure.\n【295】 No other deficiencies were noted in the selected studies that would have resulted in their omission.\n【296】 Either the individual animal dose-response data or the mean and standard deviation of the group response are required for BMD model fitting. The dose was either the intratracheal instillation (IT) or pharyngeal aspiration (PA) administered mass dose (mg/lung) or the inhaled mass concentration (mg/m. Datasets with treatment-related mortal ity of animals were not used. Data on special prepa rations of CNT (e.g., ground CNT) or studies using sensitive animal models (e.g., vitamin E deficient) were not included (although these data may be of interest for subsequent analyses using animal m od els to investigate biological mechanisms, including in sensitive human populations, or to evaluate the effect of specific alterations in CNT properties on hazard potential).\n【297】 Study details of the data selected for this risk as sessment are provided in Table A-1. These stud ies include the two recently published subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT in rats  and several IT, PA, or short-term inhalation studies in rats or mice ex posed to SWCNT  with post-exposure durations and examination from 4 to 26 weeks after exposure. In the subchronic inhalation studies, rats were headnose exposed  or nose-only exposed  to three or four different airborne mass concentrations (6 hr/d, 5 d/week) for 13 weeks. Lung responses were examined at the end of the 13-week exposure in both studies; post exposure follow-up was extended to 6 months in the Pauluhn  study.\n【298】 The IT, PA, and short-term inhalation studies pro vide additional dose-response data for comparison to other MWCNT or SWCNT with different types and amounts of metal contaminants. Although both IT and PA routes bypass the head region and deliver the CNT material directly to the trachea and lung airways, PA is to be considered more similar to inhalation than IT because PA provides greater dispersion of deposited material in the lungs . Two other short-term exposure studies (Porter  and Ellinger-Ziegelbauer-Pauluhn ), which were included in the external review draft of the CIB , have been omitted in this analysis This is be cause the dose-response data were of equivocal fit to the minimum data criteria for BMD analysis and because updates of these studies are available for the same CNT material and from the same laboratory (i.e., Mercer  andPauluhn ).\n【299】 Those studies are included in these risk analyses.\n【300】 # A.2.1.2 Dose Rate Evaluation\n【301】 A study of 1-day inhalation exposure to MWCNT (Baytubes) in rats and examined 13 weeks after the end of exposure  provided an opportunity to compare the dose-response relationships of the 1-day in halation exposure study with that of the 13-week (subchronic) inhalation study  in order to examine the influence of dose rate on the rat lung responses . These findings are relevant to interpreting and using the results from the short-term exposure studies of the SW-CNT and other MWCNT.\n【302】 # A.2.1.3 Lung R esponses Evaluated\n【303】 The lungs are the target organ for adverse effects as shown in animal studies of CNT . Granulomatous inflammation, alveolar interstitial thickening, and pulmonary fibrosis are among the benchmark responses evaluated in this risk assess ment . These responses are considered to be relevant to workers since inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases have been associated with occupational exposure to various types of inhaled particles and fibers . These pulmonary inflammation and fibrotic effects in animals were observed at relatively early stages, although they developed earlier in mice exposed to SWCNT than from exposure to crystalline silica, which is a known fibrogenic particle .\n【304】 The most quantitative measure of fibrosis was re ported by the studies that measured the thickening of the gas-exchange region of the lungs (alveolar interstitial or septal connective tissue) due to in creased collagen (as observed by lung tissue stain ing in histopathology examination) . This alveolar thickening was observed to progress with time after administration of a single dose in mice administered by PA . Alveolar thickening was  ob served in a subchronic study, which persisted up to 6 months after the end of exposure in a 13-wk inhalation study in rats . Alveolar interstitial (epithelial cell) thickness has been used as the adverse response in other risk assessment (of ozone) because it indicates \"fundamental structural remodeling\" .\n【305】 Alveolar interstitial fibrosis can be detected by Sirius red staining of septal collagen . Interstitial thickening with fibrosis has been demonstrated by Sirius red staining of lungs from mice exposed to SWCNT or MWCNT . In SWCNT exposed mice, the septal fibrosis has been further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy . Pauluhn  reported: \"Increased in terstitial collagen staining (Sirius red) occurred at 1.5 and 6 mg/m3. Focal areas of increased collagen staining were adjacent to sites of increased particle deposition and inflammatory infiltrates (onset at 0.4 mg/m3, see ). Increased septal collagen staining was depicted as equal to interstitial fibro sis (for details, see Fig .\" In that study, a severity level of minimal (category  or greater persisted or progressed up to 26 weeks after the end of the 13-week inhalation exposure to either 0.4, 1.5, or 6 mg/m3 . Hypercellularity in the bronchial alveolar junctions was observed in these same dose groups; this effect persisted after the end of exposure, but resolved by the 39th week in the 0.4 mg/m3 group. The 0.4 mg/m3 dose group was considered the LOAEL for inflammatory lung effects, while 0.1 mg/m3 was considered the NO-AEL . Concerning the focal septal thickening observed at 0.4 mg/m3, pathologists' in terpretations may differ as to whether these earlystage responses would be considered adverse or to have the potential to become adverse. NIOSH interpreted the alveolar septal thickening (and as sociated effects) in the 0.4 mg/m3 and higher dose groups as being adverse changes of relevance to hu man health risk assessment due to their persistence and consistency with the early-stage changes in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. For these rea sons, the alveolar septal thickening of minimal or higher grade (i.e., proportion of rats with this re sponse, which included rats exposed at 0.4 mg/m3 and higher doses) was selected as the benchmark response in the Pauluhn  study. Although these data were reported as the average histopathology score in each dose group , NIOSH requested the response propor tion data as these were needed for the dichotomous BMD modeling. These data were provided by Dr. Pauluhn in response to this request .\n【306】 Pulmonary inflammation has been associated with exposure to airborne particles and fibers, and it is a hallmark of occupational lung disease in humans. It is  a precursor to particle-associated lung can cer in rats . Pulmonary inflammation can be measured by the increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following exposure to various particles including CNT. However, for some CNT, the inflammation resolves, while the fibrosis continues to develop . This in dicates that neutrophilic inflammation in BAL fluid may not be a good predictor of adverse lung effects from some CNT, which appear to cause fibrosis by a different mechanism than for other types of particles and fibers (by resembling the lung base ment membrane and serving as a framework for fibroblast cell growth, without eliciting a persistent inflammatory response) . In other studies, the inflammatory effects of MWCNT were associated with granuloma development  and with alveolar lipoproteinosis, a more severe inflammatory lung response, ob served at higher doses of MWCNT .\n【307】 Minimal or higher levels of severity of these lung re sponses were selected as the benchmark responses. This included minimal level (grade 1 or higher) of pulmonary inflammation  or alveolar septal thickening  as observed by histopathology. The incidence data on the minimal level of effect that is persistent provides a sensitive measure of a critical effect, which is of interest for health risk assessment. It is not known whether the human-equivalent effects to those ob served in the animal studies would be associated with abnormal lung function or clinical disease, or if progression to more severe levels could occur if these effects developed as a result of chronic expo sure. To evaluate sensitivity of risk estimates to the selection of a minimal level of disease, risk estimates were  derived for the next level of response (grade 2 or higher) in the subchronic animal studies.\n【308】 The lung response measures in this risk assess ment are either dichotomous (proportion of ani mals observed with the response endpoint) or con tinuous (amount or level of response in individual animals) . The dichotomous responses include the incidence of lung granulomas ; granulomatous inflammation ; and histopathology grade of alveolar interstitial (septal) thickening .\n【309】 The continuous responses include the amount of hydroxyproline (as mass)  and alveolar interstitial connective tissue thickness .\n【310】 # A.2.1.4 Sum m ary of D ose-response Data\n【311】 Collectively, the data available for CNT risk as sessment include dose-response data from several rodent species and strains, both males and females, and three routes of exposure to several types of SWCNT and MWCNT with varying types and amounts of metal contaminants . The dose metric used in this risk assessment is the mass dose of CNT in the lungs, either the administered dose (IT or PA studies) or the lung burden (deposit ed or retained) estimated from the airborne particle size distribution and exposure concentration data (inhalation studies). Mass dose was used because all of the studies reported this dose metric and because mass dose was associated with the inflammatory and fibrotic lung responses in the animal studies.\n【312】 # A . 2 . 2 E s t i m a t e d L u n g D o s e i n A n i m a l s\n【313】 For the IT and PA studies , the adminis tered CNT mass dose was assumed to be equiva lent to the deposited lung dose. In the inhalation studies , the deposited lung dose was estimated from the exposure concentration and duration, the species-specific ventilation rate, and the alveolar deposition fraction (estimated from the CNT aero dynamic particle size data), as follows: x Minute Ventilation (L/min) x 0.001 m3/L x 60 min/hr\n【314】 x Alveolar Deposition Fraction\n【315】 The exposure concentration and duration, as re ported in the animal studies, are shown in Table A-1. The values used for respiratory minute venti lation were based on the species and body weight: 0.037 L/min for mice  (369 g body weight); and 0.21 L/min for male and female rats in MaHock , assuming average body weight of 300 g  using the mass-median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) data re ported for SWCNT and MWCNT .\n【316】 In the mouse inhalation study , an alveolar deposition fraction of 0.01 was estimated based on the MMAD  and interpolating from the deposition fractions for monodisperse spherical particles reported in  of Raabe . For the two subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT , in addition to the deposited dose, the retained lung dose was  estimated.\n【317】 The MPPD 2.0 model  was used to estimate the lung burden at the end of the 13-week exposure based on the particle MMAD and GSD  reported in those studies, as suming unit density (the lowest density accepted by MPPD 2.. However, Ma-Hock  reported the MWCNT particle density of 0.043 g/ ml, and Pauluhn  reported the MWCNT particle density of 0.1-0.3 g/ml. The sensitivity of the lung dose estimates to the assumption of den sity 1 or lower is evaluated in Section A.6.1.1. Also evaluated is the effect of MPPD model version 2.0 or 2.1 on the lung dose estimates. A recent update of MPPD 2.0  to MPPD 2.1  included revised estimates of the rat head/extra thoracic deposition efficiency based on the equations in Raabe , which resulted in lower predicted deposition fractions in the rat pulmonary region [personal communication, O.\n【318】 Price and E. Kuempel, 9/24/10] .\n【319】 These lung dosimetry models have not been evalu ated for CNT. However, the measured aerodynamic diameter is considered to provide a reasonable estimate of the deposition efficiency in the respi ratory tract for CNT which have MMAD in the micrometer size range   Section A.6.1.1 for further discussion). The estimates of CNT clearance and retention in the lungs may be more uncertain than those for deposition fraction, given the slower clearance reported for CNT in some animal studies . Reasonable bounds on the uncertainty of the CNT lung dose estimates are considered to be    *MPPD 2.0 human; Yeh and Schum deposition model; 9.6 m3/8 hr d (20 L/min, or 1143 ml tidal volume at 17.5 breaths/min); inhalability adjustment; assumed unit density. fMMAD and GSD in Shvedova  were estimated from data reported in Baron  . *Raabe : mouse DFalv interpolated from values in  of Raabe .\n【320】 MPPD 2.0 rat; 0.21 L/min or 2.45 ml tidal volume (assuming 300 g male and female rats) ; and 0.25 L/min or 2.45 ml tidal volume (369 g male rats) . This is because the CNT depos ited in the lungs may undergo some clearance, al though evidence from animal studies suggests the clearance rate may be slower than for other poorly soluble particles at relatively low-mass doses in the rats and mice .\n【321】 # A . 2 . 3 A n i m a l D o s e -r e s p o n s e M o d e l i n g a n d B M D E s t i m a t i o n\n【322】 The dose-response data in rats and mice exposed to SWCNT or MWCNT were modeled using benchmark dose methods . A benchmark dose has been defined as \". . . a statistical lower confidence limit for the dose corresponding to a specified increase in level of  health effect over the background level\" . The increased level of adverse effect (called a benchmark response, or BMR) associated with a BMD is typically in the low region of the dose-response data (e.g., a 10% excess risk). In this document, the term BMD is used to describe the point estimate based on maximum likelihood esti mation, and the term BMDL is used to describe the lower 95% confidence limit (i.e., as originally de fined by Crump ). A 10% excess risk, based on dichotomous or quantal data, is used because it is at or near the limit of sensitivity in the animal bioassay . The BMDL associated with a 10% BMR is used as a point of departure (POD) for low-dose extrapolation us ing linear or nonlinear methods (depending on the mode of action evidence) . The low-dose extrapolation may include estimation of the probability of effects at low doses or below a ref erence value (not risk-based) by accounting for un certainties in the dose estimation (e.g., extrapolation from animal to human, inter-individual variability, limitations in the animal data .\n【323】 # A.2.3.1 Dichotom ous Response Data\n【324】 For dichotomous data (yes/no response), a BMD is defined as the dose associated with a specified increase in the probability of a given response, ei ther as an excess risk (i.e., additional probability above background) or as a relative risk (i.e., relative to the background probability of having a normal response) .\n【325】 In this analysis, the BMD (using dichotomous data) is the dose d corresponding to a specified excess (add ed) risk (e.g., 10%) in the proportion of animals with a given adverse lung response (BMR), as follows:\n【326】 Equation A-2: BM R = P(d) -P\n【327】 where P(d) is the probability of an adverse re sponse at the BMD, and P is the probability of that adverse response in an unexposed population .\n【328】 The dichotomous BMR lung responses include the presence or absence of granulomatous inflamma tion  or alveolar septal thick ening  . The propor tion of animals responding with the minimal or higher severity was selected as the benchmark re sponse. The BMD(L) estimates are expressed as the mass dose of SWCNT or MWCNT in rodent lungs associated with the specified BMR. These animal based BMD(L)s are extrapolated to humans based on species-specific differences in the estimated de position and retention of CNTs in the lungs (Sec tion A.2..\n【329】 # A.2.3.2 C ontinuous Response Data\n【330】 BMD estimation using continuous data requires specifying a BMR level along the continuum of re sponses. Continuous response data provide in formation on the amount or degree of a biological response. Continuous response measures may in clude nonzero levels that are associated with the normal structure or function (e.g., a certain num ber immune cells or amount of protein in healthy lungs). These levels can become elevated in response to a toxicant, and at some point, they may result in irreversible, functional impairment of the lungs . If data are available, the BMRs can be based on a biologically significant response that is associated with, or expected to result in, a mate rial impairment of health. However, there may be insufficient data to determine a specific level that is associated with a measurable adverse response. In that case, a statistical criterion may be used as a BMR for continuous data .\n【331】 A statistical method (originally referred to as a \"hybrid\" method) is described by Crump  to provide BMD(L) estimates from continuous data that are equivalent to a 10% excess risk based on dichotomous data, assuming that an abnormal or biologically significant response is defined as the upper 99th percentile of the unexposed (control) distribution. According to this method, \"for a nor mal distribution with constant variance, setting BMR = 0.1 and PO = 0.01 is equivalent to choos ing the BMD to be the dose that results in an in crease in the mean equal to 1.1 times the standard deviation,\" assuming a normal distribution with constant variance . That is, if one as sumes that the probability of the specified adverse response in the unexposed population is the upper 1% of a normal distribution of responses, then se lecting a BMR of 1.1 standard deviations above the control mean response is equivalent to a 10% BMD as estimated in dichotomous data.\n【332】 In evaluating possible BMRs for the continuous data of CNT in mice, earlier studies of chronic ozone exposure in rats were examined to deter mine if a biologically-based BMR could be identi fied for pulmonary fibrosis (measured as alveolar connective tissue thickening) associated with ab normal pulmonary function . However, those rat findings did not appear to extrapolate well to the mice in Shvedova ; however, this amount of response occurred in up to 30% of the control (unexposed) mice in Shvedova , in part due to the greater variability in the alveolar tissue thickness in the unexposed mice. In addition, no data were found of a biologically relevant BMR for the amount of hydroxyproline in the lungs of rats or mice. In the absence of an identified biological basis for a BMR for the continuous response measures of alveolar connective tissue thickening or the amount of hydroxyproline, NIOSH used the statistical criterion described by Crump , in which a BMR of 1.1 standard deviations above the control mean response is equivalent to a 10% excess risk in the dichotomous data, assuming the 99th percentile of the distribution of control responses is abnormal or biologically significant.\n【333】 That is, the BMR for the continuous data (alveo lar connective tissue thickness and hydroxyproline amount) is defined as follows:\n【334】 Equation A-3: BM R = |j(d) -|j\n【335】 where ^(d) is the mean response at the BMD (d); ^ is the control mean response; and BMR is the specified number of standard deviations (SDs) (i.e., 1.1 in these analyses). Thus, the continuous databased BMD is the dose associated with a 10% in crease in the proportion of animals exposed at dose d with response greater than the 99th percentile of the control mean response. The estimates of d) and fi are derived from the fitted dose-response models (polynomial) .\n【336】 # A.2.3.3 BMD Model Fitting\n【337】 The animal dose-response data were fit using the benchmark modeling software (BMDS 2.1. . The dichotomous data were fit with a multistage (polynomial degree  model. This is the only model that provided an adequate fit to the sub chronic inhalation data, each of which  had only one dose between zero and 100% response for the endpoints evalu ated (granulomatous inflammation or alveolar sep tal thickening, histopathology grade 1 or higher).\n【338】 The other BMDS models failed to converge or, in further statistical evaluation, showed non-unique parameter solutions. The continuous dose-response data were fit with a polynomial model of degree 2 for all data with three or more dose groups, and de gree 1 (linear) for data with two groups  Table A-1 for dose groups).\n【339】 P values for goodness of fit were computed for the individual BMDS models (based on likelihood methods) . Model fit was consid ered adequate at P > 0.05 (i.e., testing for lack of fit), although the P values based on likelihood ra tio tests may not be a reliable indicator of model fit in the studies with few animals per group. The number of animals per dose group in each study is given in Table A-1. EPA typically uses a P > 0.1 criteria for BMD model fit . Either criteria is considered reasonable and represents a trade-off in the type I or type II error. That is, P > 0.1 provides more power to reject an incor rect model, while P > 0.05 provides less chance of rejecting a correct model. The BMD model fits to each data set are shown in\n【340】 # A.2.3.4 H um an-equivalent Dose and Working Lifetime Exposure\n【341】 The rodent BMD(L)s were extrapolated to humans based on species-specific differences in the alveolar epithelial surface area of the lungs (i.e., by normal izing the dose per unit of cell surface area). It is as sumed that humans and animals would have equal response to an equivalent dose (i.e., mass of CNT per unit surface area of lungs). The human-equivalent BMD and BMDL estimates were the target lung doses used to estimate, respectively, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and 95% lower con fidence limit (95% LCL) estimate of the MLE, as an 8-hr TWA exposure concentration during a 45year working lifetime.\n【342】 The human-equivalent BMD and BMDL estimates were calculated as follows: where the values used for alveolar lung surface area (AlvSA) were 102 m2 (human) ; 0.4 m2 (rat) and 0.055 m2 (mouse) . In Tables A-3 through A-5, the humanequivalent BMD(L)s were multiplied by 0.001 mg/ ^g to obtain the units of mg per lung.\n【343】 The human-equivalent BMD(L)s are expressed as the mass (mg) of CNT in the lungs. The working lifetime airborne mass concentration that would result in the BMD(L) human-equivalent lung mass dose was calculated based on either deposition only (no lung clearance) or retention (lung deposi tion and clearance), as described below.\n【344】 (a) Deposited lung dose The values assumed include 9.6 m 3 8-hr air intake (reference worker ); alveolar deposi tion fraction based on aerodynamic particle size ; and working lifetime days (250 days/ yr x 45 yr).\n【345】 # (b) Retained lung dose\n【346】 The MPPD 2.0 human model  for inhaled poorly soluble spherical particles was used to estimate the working lifetime exposure concentration that would result in the humanequivalent BMD(L) lung burden estimates. This was done by a systematic search to identify the 8-hr time weighted average (TWA) airborne concentration over a 45-year working lifetime that predicted the target lung burden. The input parameters used in the MPPD human model (Yeh and Schum human deposition model option) include CNT aerody namic particle size (MMAD, GSD) ; inhalability adjustment; oronasal-normal augmenter;\n【347】 F ig u re A -1 . Benchmark dose model (multistage, polynomial degree  fit to rodent dose-response data from the two subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT in rats: Ma-Hock , response: granulo matous inflammation, Pauluhn , response: alveolar septal thickening, minimal or greater.

Bench mark response level: 1.1 standard deviations about the control mean response. All dose-response models used in this risk assess ment provided adequate fit (P > 0. to the ro dent data for BMD(L) estimation (P values for the Pearson X2 goodness of fit test shown in Tables A-3 through A-.\n【348】 In Table A-3, the BMD(L) and BMC(L)- estimates are based on the IT, PA, or short-term inhalation exposure studies of SWCNT or MWCNT with continuous response measures. Lung responses in rodents were evaluated at 32 to 60 days after first exposure. Rodent dose is the administered (IT or PA) or estimated deposited dose (inhalation). The BMR is the specified adverse lung response at 1.1 standard deviations above the estimated rodent control mean response (i.e., alveolar connective tissue thickness or amount of hydroxyproline) (as explained in Section A.2.3.. Considerably high er 8-hr TWA concentrations are estimated based on the endpoint of lung hydroyxproline amount  compared with those based on Abbreviation for both BMC and BMCL estimates.\n【349】 the alveolar connective tissue thickness endpoint, which is a more sensitive (earlier) indicator of fi brosis .\n【350】 In Table A-4, the BMD(L) and BMC(L) estimates are based on the IT exposure study of SWCNT with dichotomous response measures. Lung responses were evaluated 90 days after the first exposure. The BMR is the 10% excess risk of the specified adverse lung response (proportion of rats with lung granu lomas). Although Lam  report doseresponse data for three different preparations of SWCNT (containing either 2% Fe, 27% Fe, or 26% Ni), the BMD(L) and BMC(L) estimates are pro vided only for the SWCNT with 2% Fe, which was the only dataset of the three reported by Lam  that was adequately fit by the BMD model .\n【351】 Table A-5 provides the BMD(L) and BMC(L) esti mates based on the two subchronic inhalation stud ies of MWCNTs, which  report dichotomous response measures. Lung responses were evaluated at the end of the 13-week (91 d) exposure period. Rodent dose is either the total deposited lung dose or the retained lung dose at the end of exposure.\n【352】 The BMR is estimated as the 10% excess risk of the specified adverse lung response (granulomatous inflammation or alveolar septal thickening of histopathology grade 1 or higher). As expected, the esti mates based on deposited lung dose are lower than those based on the retained lung dose, because the assumption of no clearance in the deposited lung dose results in a lower estimated 8-hr TWA con centration to attain the human-equivalent BMD(L) lung burdens. The estimates for MWCNT (with 9.6% Al2O based on the rat granulomatous in flammation response are lower than those for MW-CNT (Baytubes) (with 0.53% Co) based on the rat alveolar septal thickening response.\n【353】 Table A-6 shows the animal and human BMD(L) estimates and equivalent working lifetime 8-hr TWA concentration estimates, BMC(L), associated with grade 2 (slight/mild) or higher lung responses in the subchronic inhalation studies, based on the estimated deposited lung dose. As expected, higher BMD(L)s and BMC(L)s are estimated from the Table A-3. Benchmark dose estimates- and associated hum an working lifetime airborne concentrations-continuous response data in rats or mice exposed to SWCNT or MWCNT by IT, PA,f or short-term inhalation (dose metric: adm inistered or estim ated deposited lung dose)\n【354】 Table A-5. Benchmark dose estim ates and associated working lifetime airborne concentrations-grade 1 or higher severity of lung responses in rats after subchronic inhalation of MWCNT (dose metric: estim ated deposited or retained dose in lungs) histopathology grade 2 or higher lung responses  compared with those estimated from histopathology grade 1 (minimal) or higher re sponses  because more animals devel oped the grade 1 or higher response at a given dose (i.e., histopathology grade 1 or higher is a more sensitive response).\n【355】 A . Histopathology severity scores for alveolar septal thickening were available for each study. The num ber of male rats with alveolar septal thickening (of minimal or higher grade) and the respective expo sure concentrations are as follows:\n【356】 - Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn : 1, 0, and 6 rats (6 total per group) at 0, 11.0, and 241.3 mg/m3.\n【357】 - Pauluhn : 0, 0, 9, 10, 10 rats (10 total per group) at 0, 0.1, 0.45, 1.62, and 5.98 mg/m3.\n【358】 The dose metric used for this comparison was the deposited lung dose, estimated from MPPD 2.0  based on the particle size data (MMAD and GSD) and the rat exposure con ditions reported in each study.\n【359】 To evaluate whether these data  can be described by the same dose-response relationship, a multistage (polynomial degree  model  was fit to the combined data . This model provided adequate fit to the data (P = 0., suggesting that these data can be de scribed by the same dose-response model using the estimated total deposited lung dose, regardless of the dose rate differences (i.e., dose administered in 1 day vs. during 91 days). This finding is consistent with the impaired clearance and biopersistence of the deposited MWCNT in the rat lungs at these doses as shown in Pauluhn .\n【360】 A .  . NRC  and others have recommended using risk-based low-dose extrapolation for non cancer endpoints. NIOSH practice has  in cluded risk-based low-dose extrapolation for non cancer endpoints. In the absence of information on the shape of the dose-response relationship in the low-dose region, assumptions can include linear and nonlinear model-based extrapolation. Linear extrapolation is the most protective (i.e., unlikely to underestimate the risk). However, the actual risk could be much lower, including zero.\n【361】 Low-dose linear extrapolation of the working life time-equivalent 10% excess risk estimates in Table A-5 . These estimates are based on lung dose estimates assuming either total deposited lung dose (no clearance) or retained dose (normal, spherical particle-based clearance). Risk estimates are higher for the no clearance assumption than those assum ing normal clearance, within either the minimal (grade   or slight/mild (grade  (Ta ble A- lung responses. These excess (exposureattributable) risk estimates were derived from the multistage (degree  model fit to the rat subchron ic dose-response data, or by linear extrapolation below the 10% BMC(L) estimates shown in Tables A-5 and A-6.\n【362】 # A.4 Discussion\n【363】 NIOSH conducted a quantitative risk assessment of CNTs by evaluating dose-response data of early-stage adverse lung effects in rats and mice exposed to sever al types of SWCNT or MWCNT (with different metal contaminants), by several routes of exposure (inha lation, PA, or IT), and duration of exposure (single day or subchronic) and post-exposure period (up to 26 weeks). Because of the different study designs and response endpoints used in the rodent studies, lim ited information was available to evaluate the extent to which the differences in the risk estimates across studies are due to differences in the CNT material or are attributable to other study differences. Some evi dence indicates that CNT with certain metals (nickel, 26%)  or with higher metal content (18% vs. 0.2% Fe)  are more toxic and fibrogenic. However, some studies have shown that both unpurified and purified (low metal content) CNT were associated with early-onset and persistent pulmonary fibrosis at relatively low-mass doses  and 0.4 mg/ m3 , which are more than an order of magnitude lower than the LOAEL of 7 mg/m3 for ultrafine carbon black  in the same animal species and study design (13-week inhalation studies in rats, although with different strains, Wistar (male and female)  and F-344 (female) ).\n【364】 Because no chronic animal studies or epidemio logical studies of workers producing or using CNT have been published to date, the best available data for risk assessment were the subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT in rats . For SWCNT, no subchronic stud ies were available, and several short-term studies (IT, PA, or inhalation exposure) in rats or mice provide the only available dose-response data for either SWCNT\n【365】 .\n【366】 All of these studies reported inflammatory, granu lomatous, and/or fibrotic lung effects of relevance to human health risk assessment. These lung effects in the animal studies were relatively early-stage and were not reversible after exposure ended (up to approximately 6 months post-exposure ). In the studies with multiple post-exposure follow-up times, the amount of pulmonary fibrosis persisted or progressed with longer follow-up . One of the measures of pulmonary fibrosis used in the short-term stud ies -alveolar epithelial cell thickness (due to in creased collagen deposition associated with CNT mass lung dose)-was  used to develop the EPA ozone standard. This response endpoint was selected by EPA as the adverse lung response for cross-species dose-response extrapolation, because it indicates \"fundamental structural remodeling\" .\n【367】 The excess risk estimates based on the subchronic and short-term studies of MWCNT and SWCNT suggest that workers are at >10% excess risk of developing early-stage adverse lung effects (pul monary inflammation, granulomas, alveolar septal thickening, and/or fibrosis) if exposed for a work ing lifetime at the estimated upper LOQ of 7 ^g/m3 based on NIOSH Method 5040 for measuring the airborne concentration of CNT  (Appendix C; Tables A-3 through A-. Working lifetime airborne concentration (8-hr TWA) esti mates of 0.51-4.2 ^g/m3 MLE and 0.19-1.9 ^g/m3 95% LCL were associated with a 10% excess risk of early-stage lung effects (histopathology grade 1 minimal or higher) based on the subchronic in halation studies . For histopathology grade 2 (slight  or slight/mild ), the working lifetime 8-hr TWA concentrations associated with an estimated 10% excess risk are 1.0 to 44 ^g/m3 MLE and 0.69 to 19 ^g/m3 95% LCL .\n【368】 As discussed in Section A.2.3, the 10% BMDL esti mates are a typical POD for extrapolation to lower risk. NIOSH does not consider 10% or greater ex cess risk levels of these early-stage lung effects to be acceptable if equivalent effects were to occur in workers as a result of working lifetime exposures to CNT. Linear extrapolation by application of un certainty factors (e.g., Table A - would result in lower 8-hr TWA concentrations. However, the lowest LOQ of NIOSH Method 5040 (1 ^g/m is the best that can be achieved at this time in most workplaces and is similar to or greater than the 8-hr TWA concentrations estimated to be asso ciated with 10% excess risk of minimal (grade  effects . Some of the risk estimates are less than 10% at the LOQ of 1 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA), in particular those based on the slight/mild (grade  rat lung effects and assumed normal clearance .\n【369】 Although uncertainties and limitations exist in these animal studies, the evidence supports the health-based need to reduce exposures below 1 ^g/ m3. These risk estimates indicate the need for re search to develop more sensitive measurement methods for airborne CNT in the workplace, to demonstrate effective exposure control, and to evaluate the need for additional risk management measures such as the use of respirators and other personal protective equipment and medical screen ing (, Appendix B). Chronic bioassay data are  needed to reduce the uncertainty concern ing the potential for chronic adverse health effects from long-term exposure to CNT. Evaluation of the factors that influence the risk estimates and the ar eas of uncertainty are discussed below.\n【370】 A . Several factors suggest that in the absence of chronic data these short-term and subchronic ani mal data may be reasonable for obtaining initial es timates of the risk of human noncancer lung effects from exposure to CNT. First, some fraction of CNT that deposit in the lungs are likely to be biopersis tent based on studies in animals  and studies of other poor ly soluble particles in human lungs . Sec ond, the pulmonary fibrosis developed earlier and was of equal or greater severity than that observed from exposure to the same mass dose of other in haled particles or fibers . In the PA or IT studies, the administered lung dose is known, although the pattern of lung deposition (especially for IT ad ministration) may differ from that of inhalation.\n【371】 The subchronic inhalation studies and some of the PA studies include multiple doses, which can provide better information about the shape of the dose-response relationship. However, in the sub chronic studies, steep dose-response relationships were observed for lung response proportions based on histopathology score, reaching 100% response for minimal or higher severity (grade  . Although the data are sparse in the low dose region (near a 10% response level), the BMD(L) estimates are generally similar to the LOAEL and NOAEL values reported in those studies .\n【372】 A comparison of data from 1-day and 13-week inhalation exposures in rats , indicates that the dose-response relationship was consistent de spite the differences in dose-rate in those two stud ies . This finding indicates that it may be reasonable to assume that the dose-response relationships for the IT, PA, and short-term inha lation exposure studies would be consistent with the subchronic study results if the same response is examined at the same time point, although ad ditional study is needed to confirm this finding. The BMC(L) estimates among the subchronic and short-term studies , all estimates are relatively low mass concentrations. It is difficult to tease out the CNT-specific factors affecting these estimates from those due to the other study differences (e.g., expo sure route, duration, animal species, lung response measures).\n【373】 The two subchronic inhalation studies of MWCNT , based on the same study design (13 week inhalation) and animal species/strain (Wistar rats), facilitates com parison. Different types of MWCNT and different generation methods for aerosolizing exposures were used in each study, although the primary par ticle sizes reported were similar-approximately 10 nm in width and 0.1-10 ^m in length, with spe cific surface area of approximately 250-300 m 2/g . The aerody namic diameter (and resulting alveolar deposition fraction) estimates were  fairly similar ; yet the bulk densities differed (approximately 0.04 and 0.2 g/ml, respectively, in Ma-Hock  and Pauluhn ). The metal content  differed, with 9.6% ALO3 in the MWCNT in the Ma-Hock  study vs. 0.5% Co in the MWCNT (Baytubes) in the Pauluhn  study. The lung responses differed both qualita tively and quantitatively, including \"pronounced granulomatous inflammation, diffuse histiocytic and neutrophilic inflammation, and intra-alveolar lipoproteinosis\" with a LOAEL of 0.1 mg/m3 in Ma-Hock , vs. \"inflammatory changes in the bronchioloalveolar region and increased interstitial collagen staining\" with a LOAEL of 0.45 mg/m3 . Yet, both MWCNT studies report ed LOAELs that are lower by more than an order of magnitude compared to the LOAEL (7 mg/m reported in a 13-week inhalation study of ultrafine carbon black .\n【374】 A recent study provides a quantitative comparison of the effects of SWCNT and MWCNT on pul monary interstitial fibrosis . In this study, MWCNTs were administered to mice by pharyngeal aspiration at several different doses (0 , 10, 20, 40, or 80 ^g); the lung tissues (stained for collagen using Sirius red) were exam ined at 56 days post-exposure. At the 80-^g dose of MWCNT, the average thickness of the alveo lar interstitial connective tissue was significantly increased at 28 days, and a progressive increase in thickness was observed at 56 days. The 40-^g MW CNT dose group  showed a significant increase in the interstitial connective tissue thickness at 56 days. These data were compared with those of an earlier study of SWCNT  using the same study design. The individual MWCNTs had a mean diameter of 49 nm and a mean length of 3.9 ^m. The individual SWCNTs were 1-4 nm in diameter and several hundred nanometers in length. Both SWCNT and MWCNT were rapidly incorporated into the alveolar interstitial spaces (within 1 hour individual CNT or small clumps of CNT were observed), although the percentage of the administered SWCNT observed in the alveolar interstitium (~90%) was much higher than that for MWCNT (~8%). After accounting for the differ ences in the target tissue dose, SWCNTs were still ~8.5-fold more fibrogenic than MWCNTs. Howev er, the surface area of SWCNT was ~20-fold greater per unit mass than that of MWCNTs (508 m2/g for SWCNT vs. 26 m2/g for MWCNT), suggesting that the greater fibrogenic potency of SWCNT may be due to its greater surface area. When the lung re sponse was evaluated per unit CNT surface area dose, SWCNT was no longer more potent, and the MWCNT were 2.5-fold more potent on a surface area basis. There is uncertainty about the degree of dispersion (and hence available surface) of these materials in vivo, which precludes assigning exact potency factors . However, these findings suggest that the greater fibrotic potency of SWCNT on a mass basis is likely due to its greater surface area available to react with lung tissue.\n【375】 Comparison of other CNT types and metal content is generally impeded by differences in study design. In one of the few studies to investigate CNT with different metal content, Lam  reported lung granuloma and inflammation responses in mice administered IT doses of SWCNT containing either 2% Fe, 27% Fe, or 26% Ni. The number of mice developing granulomas by group (each con taining 5 mice) were the following:\n【376】 - 0.1 mg dose: 2 (2% Fe); 5 (27% Fe); and 0 (26% Ni)\n【377】 - 0.5 mg dose: 5 (2% Fe); 5 (27% Fe); and 5 (26% Ni)\n【378】 In addition, three mice died in the first week in the 0.5 mg dose of the 26% Ni group.\n【379】 Because of the sparse data and the steep doseresponse relationship, only the SWCNT containing 2% Fe were adequately fit by the BMDS model. The high mortality rate in mice exposed to the SWCNT containing Ni suggests this material is highly toxic.\n【380】 The greater response proportion in the mice exposed to 0.1 mg SWCNT with 27% Fe (5/ compared with rats exposed to the same dose of SWCNT with 2% Fe (2/ suggests that the CNT with higher Fe con tent are more toxic than CNT with lower Fe content.\n【381】 In Shvedova [2005Shvedova [ , 2008, higher iron con tent was  associated with greater lung response and thus lower BMD were of simi lar or greater potency (i.e., similar or greater lung responses at the same mass dose) in these animal studies compared to the other types of particles or fibers tested (asbestos, silica, ultrafine carbon black) [Lam 2004;Muller 2005;Shve dova 2005Shve dova , 2008.\n【382】 # A . 4 . 3 L u n g D o s e E s t i m a t i o n\n【383】 In any CNT risk assessment, there may be greater uncertainty in the estimated lung dose of respirable CNT than there is for spherical airborne particles for which lung dosimetry models have been de veloped and validated. Evaluations have not been made on the influence of particle characteristics (e.g., shape and density) on the inhalability and deposition of CNT in the human respiratory tract, and on the clearance or biopersistence of CNT.\n【384】 However, the available data on the aerodynamic size of CNT provides an initial estimate (based on validated models for spherical particles) of the deposited mass fraction of airborne CNT in the human respiratory tract, and specifically in the al veolar (gas exchange) region. The clearance rate of CNT from the lungs may be more uncertain than the deposition efficiency, as animal studies indicate that CNT clearance becomes impaired in rat lungs at lower mass doses than for larger particles of greater density . The NIOSH risk assessment helps to characterize this uncertainty by providing bounds on the range of possible lung dose estimates, from assuming normal clearance to assuming no clearance of the deposited CNT. This approach  provides a framework for introduc ing improved dose estimates when validated lung dosimetry models for CNT become available.\n【385】 The assumptions used in the lung dose estima tion have a large influence on the animal and human-equivalent BMD(L) or BMC(L) estimates , as well as on the estimated human-equivalent NOAEL . The rat BMD(L) estimates based on the estimated retained lung dose after subchronic inhalation exposure in rats are lower than those based on the estimated deposited lung dose . This is because the retained dose estimates allow for some lung clearance to occur during the 13-week exposure in rats, and a lower dose estimate is therefore associ ated with a given fixed response proportion. The human-equivalent BMD(L) estimates based on retained dose are  lower because they are pro portional to the rat BMD(L)s (i.e., calculated based on the ratio of the human to rat alveolar epithelial cell surface area). However, the working lifetime 8-hr TWA concentrations, BMC(L)s, based on the estimated retained lung doses are higher than those based on the estimated deposited lung dose. This is because the retained dose estimates (which assume some particle clearance from workers' lungs during the 45 years of exposure), require a higher inhaled airborne concentration to reach the estimated hu man-equivalent BMD(L) lung doses.\n【386】 The estimated deposited lung dose of CNT (assum ing no clearance) may overestimate the actual CNT lung dose, given that the short-term kinetic data have shown some CNT clearance in rats and mice . On the other hand, the estimated retained lung dose of CNT, based on models for poorly soluble spheri cal particles, may underestimate the retained CNT lung burden, given that overloading of rat lung clearance has been observed at lower mass doses of MWCNT (Baytubes) than for other poorly soluble particles . Thus, although there is uncertainty in the deposition and retention of CNT in the animal and human lungs, the deposited and retained lung dose estimates reported in this risk assessment may represent reasonable upper and lower bounds of the actual lung doses.\n【387】 A . 4 . 4 C r i t i c a l E f f e c t L e v e l E s t i m a t e s\n【388】 The response endpoints in these animal studies of CNT are all relatively early-stage effects. Although these effects were persistent or progressive after the end of exposure in some studies, there was no information on whether these responses were as sociated with adverse functional effects. More advanced-stage responses (grade 2 or higher severity on histopathology examination) were  evalu ated, and as expected, these responses resulted in lower risk estimates . It is expected that exposure limits derived from these early response data would be more protective than those based on frank adverse effects. On the other hand, because of the lack of chronic studies, there is considerable uncertainty about the potential chronic adverse health endpoints.\n【389】 The excess risk estimates at the lower LOQ (1 ^g/ m are considerably lower than those at the upper LOQ (7 ^g/m of NIOSH Method 5040, for either minimal  or slight/mild  lung effects based on the rat subchronic inhalation data.\n【390】 The range in the estimates in Table A-7 and A-8 reflects the low precision in the animal data and the uncertainty about CNT retention in the lungs. There is  uncertainty about the relationship between the lung dose and response, including whether there is a threshold. For example, for slight/mild lung effects , the actual risk could be as low as zero or as high as 16% at the REL of 1 ^g/m3.\n【391】 NIOSH utilized BMD modeling methods to esti mate the critical effect level (i.e., the dose associated with the critical effect or benchmark response) in order to provide a standardized method for risk estimation across studies. In contrast, the NOAELbased approaches do not estimate risk, but may as sume safe exposure or zero risk below the derived OEL. BMD modeling  uses all of the doseresponse data, rather than only a single dose for a NOAEL or LOAEL, and takes appropriate statisti cal account of sample size, unlike NOAEL-based approaches. However, the BMD modeling options for some of these CNT data were limited because of sparse data, and the dose groups with 100% response (observed in the subchronic inhalation studies) contribute little information to the BMD estimation. A common challenge in risk assess ment is defining a biologically relevant response for continuous endpoints, which was  encountered in this risk assessment. A standard practice of using a statistical definition of the benchmark response was used for the continuous BMD estimation in the absence of data on the functional significance of the early-stage pulmonary inflammation and fibrotic responses .\n【392】 For CNT, as with other chemicals, there is uncer tainty in whether a NOAEL or a BMDL from a short-term or subchronic study in animals would  be observed in a chronic study. For example, in the Pauluhn  study, 0.1 mg/m3 was the NOAEL based on subchronic inhalation exposure in rats, but there was some indication that lung clearance overloading may have already begun (i.e., retention half-time about two-fold higher than normal, although imprecision in the low dose measurement was noted) . A comparison of the BMD and the NOAEL estimates shows that these estimates are statistically consis tent . Thus, there is uncertainty as to whether chronic exposure at 0.1 mg/m3 might result in adverse lung effects that were not ob served during subchronic exposure. It is  un certain whether these subchronic effects (without additional exposure) would resolve with longer post-exposure duration (beyond the 26-week post-exposure period in the Pauluhn  study). Yet, workers may be exposed to CNT daily for many years, e.g., up to a working lifetime. The NIOSH REL is intended to reduce the risk of lung disease from exposures to CNT and CNF up to a 45-year working lifetime.\n【393】 A . 4 . 5 A n i m a l D o s e -r e s p o n s e D a t a Q u a l i t y\n【394】 In the absence of epidemiological data for CNT, the two subchronic inhalation studies of two types of MWCNT, in addition to the short-term studies of SWCNT and MWCNT, provide the best available dose-response data to develop initial estimates of the risk of early-stage adverse lung responses as sociated with exposure to CNT. The availability of animal dose-response data for different types of CNT-and the consistent low mass concentra tion BMC(L) estimates-suggests these risk esti mates are relatively robust across a range of CNT types, including SWCNT or MWCNT, either puri fied or unpurified (containing different types and amounts of metal), dispersed or agglomerated. Al though a formal comparison of the potency of the different CNT is not feasible because of differences in study design, these studies consistently show that relatively low-mass doses of CNT are associ ated with early-stage adverse lung effects in rats and mice. Consequently, the human-equivalent bench mark dose and working lifetime exposure estimates derived from these studies are  relatively low on a mass basis. The excess risk estimates of early-stage adverse lung responses to CNT generally indicate > 10% excess risk (lower 95% confidence limit esti mates) at the upper LOQ (7 ^g/m of the measure ment method (NIOSH Method  regardless of the CNT type or purification . Lower risks are estimated at the optimal LOQ (1 ^g/m, depending on lung dose assumptions .\n【395】 A more in-depth analysis of specific areas of uncer tainty in this CNT risk assessment is provided in Section A.6. This includes quantitative evaluation of the methods and assumptions used in the CNT risk assessment for the derivation of a REL.\n【396】 # A.5 Conclusions\n【397】 Risk estimates were developed using benchmark dose methods applied to rodent dose-response data of ad verse lung effects following subchronic or short-term exposure to various types of SWCNT and MWCNT.\n【398】 In the absence of validated lung dosimetry models for CNT, lung doses were estimated assuming either de posited or retained lung dose in animals and humans. These findings suggest that workers are at risk of de veloping adverse lung effects, including pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, if exposed to CNT over a working lifetime. Based on the two rat subchronic inhalation studies for two types of MWCNT (with different metal content), working lifetime exposures of 0.2-2 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA; 95% LCL estimates) are estimated to be associated with a 10% excess risk of early-stage lung effects (minimal severity grade  . For a severity level of slight/mild (grade , the 45-year working lifetime excess risk estimates are approximately 0.7-19 ^g/m3 (8-hr TWA; 95% LCL estimates) .\n【399】 These working liftetime 8-hr TWA concentrations are below the estimated upper LOQ (7 ^g/m of NIOSH Method 5040 for measuring the respirable mass concentration of CNT in air as an 8-hr TWA. Similar risk estimates relative to the LOQ were  derived for SWCNT and MWCNT from the short term studies, regardless of whether the CNT were purified or unpurified (with different types and amounts of metals), i.e., 0.08-12 ^g/m3 . Lower risks are estimated at the lower LOQ of 1 ^g/m3, which are approximately 0.5% to 16% based on the rat subchronic dose-response data for the slight/mild lung effects and different lung dose estimation (95% UCL estimates) . Higher risks are estimated for the more sen sitive endpoint of minimal grade 1 lung effects . Additional analyses and risk estimates based on other methods and assumptions are pro vided in Section A.6. (d) interspecies dose normalization. The deposition fraction is based on the airborne particle size (and to some extent shape for nonspherical particles), on the breathing pattern (nasal, oral, or combination) and minute ventilation, and on the lung airway ge ometry. The ventilation rate depends on the species and on the activity level. Reference values are avail able for the average ventilation rates in rats and hu mans . The airborne particle size data (as reported in the animal stud ies)  were used to estimate the deposited lung dose of CNT in rats and humans, using spheri cal particle based models. The long-term clearance kinetics have been well studied and validated for inhaled poorly soluble spherical particles in rats [Anjilvel and Asgharian 1995;Asgharian 2001Asgharian , 2003 and in humans [ICRP 1994;Kuempel 2001a, b;Gregoratto 2010Gregoratto , 2011, but models spe cifically for CNT are not yet available.\n【400】 # A.6 Sensitivity Analyses\n【401】 This section examines some of the key param eter values used in the lung dose estimation, and  characterizes the quantitative influence of alternative models and assumptions. Two stud ies were available to evaluate the lung dose es timates in rats. Pauluhn  and Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  provided cobalt tracer-based measurements of the CNT lung burden based on cobalt-tracer measurements. These data were used to compare MPPD modelbased estimates. Because of prediction equation changes in the MPPD model from version 2.0 to 2.1, which affect the model-predicted rat alveo lar deposition fraction predictions (discussed further in Section A.2., the cobalt tracer-based estimates are compared to each model version . The influence of assumed density on the CNT lung deposition fraction is quantified in addition to the evaluation of the MPPD model version 2.0 vs. 2.1 predictions . The derivation of allometricbased (body weight scaled) lung ventilation rate estimates is  discussed .\n【402】 # A.6.1.1 Lung Dosim etry Modelbased Deposition Fraction and Dose Estimates\n【403】 The fraction of inhaled CNT that is deposited in the respiratory tract is predicted from the aerosol characteristics. The deposition mechanisms include impaction, sedimentation, interception, and dif fusion. The aerodynamic diameter, by definition, represents the gravitational settling (sedimentation) behavior of particles . The definition of aerodynamic diameter standardizes the shape (to spherical) and density (to that of water, 1 g/ml).\n【404】 The aerodynamic diameter of a particle, regardless of its shape and density, is the diameter of a sphere with the same gravitational settling velocity as the particle in question. Conventionally, aerodynamic diameter has been used as a reference diameter to represent total particle deposition in the respiratory system over a wide particle size range. Models such as MPPD  use particle density (specified by the user), to convert aerodynamic to physical diameter and vice versa, and in this manner capture the key particle deposi tion mechanisms for spherical particles.\n【405】 However, for high-aspect ratio particles and par ticles less than 500 nm diameter, including some individual or airborne agglomerates of CNT, the aerodynamic diameters are much smaller than their diffusion-equivalent diameter (i.e., the mea sure of diameter that captures the diffusional depo sition mechanism) . When the different equivalent diameters could significantly differ, it is recommended to ex perimentally measure these property-equivalent diameters, and subsequently use the measured di ameters in the lung deposition models to provide a reliable representation of each relevant deposition mechanism .\n【406】 In the animal inhalation studies of CNT , the airborne particle sizes (MMAD) were in the micrometer size range (~1-3 ^m)  and the airborne CNT structures in those studies were roughly spherical agglomerates-suggesting that deposition from diffusional mechanisms may be negligible and aerodynamic diameter may provide a reasonable estimate of the deposition efficiency of CNT in the respiratory tract. However, the density of the airborne structures can affect the deposition efficiency predictions in MPPD . An evaluation of the effect of the CNT density assump tions on the rat alveolar deposition fraction is pro vided in this section.\n【407】 In the rat model, MPPD version 2.1 (but not 2. accepts density values less than one. The MMAD (GSD) values reported in the subchronic rat inha lation studies varied slightly with particle concen tration and sampling device . The central MMAD (GSD) values were used for the deposition fraction and lung burden estimates. The influence of the alternative particle size estimates was not fully evaluated but ap peared to be minimal compared with other factors (MPPD rat model version and assumed density).\n【408】 In addition, the MPPD model estimates of CNT lung burden in rats are compared to the measured CNT lung burdens from two rat inhalation studies. Pauluhn  reported the amount of cobalt tracer in the rat lungs as well as the amount of Co that was matrix-bound to the CNT. The Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  1-day inhalation study with 91day post-exposure follow-up  reported Co data. These data provided a basis for comparison to lung burden estimates from the MPPD models.\n【409】 Results in Table A -9 show that the rat deposition estimates (at the same density) vary by a factor of approximately two depending on the version of the MPPD model (2.0 or 2.. As discussed in Sec tion A.2.2, this is apparently because of a change in MPPD 2.1 in the deposition efficiency equations for the head region of the rat model, which reduces the deposition efficiency of the alveolar region. The lower density further reduces the alveolar deposi tion efficiency estimates. These findings suggest that rat alveolar lung dose estimates based on MPPD 2.1 (regardless of density assumption) would result in greater estimated potency of the CNT (because the response proportions do not change) and thus lower BMD(L) estimates in rats and lower OEL esti mates (by approximately a factor of two) than those shown in the main analyses.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6 in Pauluhn  to be approximately 10, 125, 450, and 1,650 ng, respectively, by increasing exposure concentration. The CNT amount in the lungs was estimated from the reported 0.115% Co that was matrixbound to the CNT ; the remaining mass (99.885% was assumed to be CNT). The CNT mass was thus calculated as CNT (ng) =  / 0.00115. CNT (ng) x 0.001 |ig/ng equals CNT (|ig). *MMAD (GSD)-2.9 (1. and 2.2 (2., respectively, for 11 and 241 mg/m3, from Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn ; alveo lar deposition fraction-0.050 and 0.043, respectively, for 11 and 241 mg/m3; assumed density of 1 g/ml; tidal volume-2.45 ml. fAssumed density of 0.2 g/ml; tidal volume-2.45 ml; alveolar deposition fraction-0.019 and 0.026, respectively for 11 and 241 mg/m3. *Mass of cobalt at 91 d post-exposure was estimated from  in Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  to be approximately 0.03 |ig (11 mg/m and 0.39 |ig (241 mg/m. The CNT amount in the lungs was estimated from the reported 0. Table A-10 shows that the cobalt-based estimate of CNT in the rat lungs is numerically between the deposited and retained dose estimated by MPPD 2.0 (density of . The MPPD 2.11 model (den sity of 0.  underestimated the Co-based lung burden, even the deposited dose estimate (assuming no clearance). These findings suggest that the model-based estimates of the de posited and retained rat lung doses in the main analyses (MPPD 2.0, density  provided reason able estimates of the bounds on the estimated lung burden. Moreover, these findings are consis tent with the animal toxicokinetic data that show CNT overloads alveolar clearance at lower mass doses than for particles with lower total surface area or volume lung dose, resulting in increased retention of CNT in the lungs of rats and mice than expected for other poorly soluble respirable particles . The finding that the cobalt-tracer estimates were be tween the deposited and retained lung doses is consistent with CNT reduced clearance compared with spherical particles.\n【410】 Similar comparisons were made of the cobalt-tracer or lung model estimated lung dose of MWCNT in a study of rats exposed for 1 day . Results show that the MPPD 2.0 model overestimated the retained lung dose of CNT by nearly a factor of two (at the higher dose) compared with the estimates based on the cobalt tracer in the Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn  study . This suggests greater clearance than would be predicted at this high dose (241 mg/m based on overload ing of lung clearance in the rat model (MPPD 2.. If the retained lung dose estimated by cobalt tracer is the best estimate (closest to actual), this suggests that the BMD estimates using the modelestimated lung burdens may be overestimates (i.e., they underestimate potency because the response proportion is constant while the actual lung bur den causing the effect may be lower). Some error may  exist in the cobalt-tracer measurements of the MWCNT mass (estimated from  in Ellinger-Ziegelbauer and Pauluhn ). where VE is the minute ventilation (L/min); BW is body weight; and bo + bi are species-specific pa rameters.\n【411】 For the rat, bo + bi are -0.578 and 0.821, respec tively (-6 of US EPA ). For a 300 g rat, the ventilation rate can be calculated as follows:\n【412】 Equation A-7: 0.21 L/min = Exp [-0.578 + 0.821 x Ln(0.\n【413】 This is  the default minute ventilation in MPPD .\n【414】 Rat mean body weights in Pauluhn  were reported as 369 g (male) and 245 g (female) in the control (unexposed) group at 13 weeks. Because the alveolar septal thickening response data in Pauluhn  were based on male rats only, a male rat minute ventilation of 0.25 L/min (calculated from equation A- was used to estimate lung dose in that study.\n【415】 Ma-Hock  did not report the rat body weight, although the rat strain (Wistar) and study duration (13 weeks) were the same as in Pauluhn . Because the granulomatous inflammation response data in Ma-Hock  were com bined for the 10 male and 10 female rats in each dose group (since response proportions were sta tistically consistent), an average rat body weight in male and female rats of 300 g was assumed, which is similar to the male and female average body weight of 307 g reported in Pauluhn  and the default value of 300 g in MPPD. Subsequent ly, body weights were obtained for the Ma-Hock  study . The average male and female rat body weight at 13 weeks was nearly identical (305 g) to that reported in Pau luhn . Other rat minute ventilation rates of 0.8-1 L/min per kg [Pauluhn 2010a, citing Snipes 1989 would result in somewhat higher lung dose estimates.\n【416】 Based on equation A-6, a minute ventilation of 0.21 L/min is calculated for female and male rats in Ma-Hock , and 0.25 L/min for male rats in Pauluhn . Minute ventilation is the prod uct of tidal volume and breathing frequency. As suming the same breathing frequency (102 min-, a tidal volume of 2.45 ml is calculated (equation A- and used instead of the default value in MPPD 2.0  in estimating the rat lung dose in the Pauluhn  data.\n【417】 In humans, based on the MPPD 2.0 model , the default pulmonary ventila tion rate is 7.5 L/min, based on default values of 12 min-1 breathing frequency and 625 ml tidal volume.\n【418】 The \"reference worker\" ventilation rate is 20 L/min  or 9.6 m3/8 hr (given 0.001m3/L, and 480 min/8-hr). In these estimates, 17.5 min-1 breath ing frequency and 1143 ml tidal volume  were used in MPPD 2.0 to correspond to a 20 L/min reference-worker ventilation rate.\n【419】 A . 6 . 2 C r i t i c a l E f f e c t L e v e l S e l e c t i o n\n【420】 A key step in the dose-response analyses of any risk assessment is estimating the critical effect level.\n【421】 A critical effect level from an animal study is ex trapolated to humans to derive a POD for low dose extrapolation . A critical effect is typically the most sensitive effect associated with exposure to the toxicant (i.e., the effect observed at the lowest dose) which is adverse or is causally linked to an adverse effect. The early-stage lung effects discussed in Section A.2.1.3 are the criti cal effects used in both the main risk assessment and in these sensitivity analyses. The primary Ma-Hock  0. Lowest observed adverse effect level; BMC: Benchmark concen tration (maximum likelihood estimate) associated with 10% excess risk of specified BMR. BMCL: 95% lower confidence limit of the BMC; based on a multistage model, polynomial degree 2, P = 0.; BMR: Benchmark response; nd: not determined *Same response proportion per dose, and therefore the same BMD(L) estimates, for alveolar lipoproteinosis. critical effect selected is the proportion of rats with minimal (grade  or higher severity of pul monary inflammation or alveolar septal thickening (as reported by Ma-Hock  and Pau luhn ). In addition, grade 2 (slight/mild) or greater effects (as reported in the same studies) were  evaluated as a response endpoint since the interpretation of the histopathology, for a slight or mild response, may be less variable than that for a minimal response, and may  be more relevant to a potential adverse health effect in humans.\n【422】 The critical effect levels in the main analysis are the BMD(L) estimates from the dose-response m od eling of the rat estimated deposited or retained lung dose and to the human-equivalent lung dose estimates. The working lifetime exposure concen tration that would result in that equivalent lung dose was then calculated, assuming either particlesize specific lung deposition only (assuming no clearance) or the estimated retained lung dose (as suming normal spherical particle clearance).\n【423】 In the main risk analysis, BMD methods were se lected over NOAELs or LOAELs because of sev eral statistical advantages . However, BMD(L) estimates may  be uncertain, for ex ample, when the dose spacing is not optimal, as occurred in the CNT subchronic studies . In this sensitivity analysis, NOAELs and LOAELs reported in the subchronic inhalation studies  are used as the effect levels in evaluations of alterna tive methods to derive OEL estimates. A quanti tative comparison of possible critical effect levels is shown in Table A-12. The BMDL estimates are generally similar to the NOAEL estimates (within a factor of approximately 1 to , which suggests that the BMDL estimates may be reasonable despite the sparse data in the low dose region of the subchron ic inhalation studies .\n【424】 A statistical analysis was performed to compare the NOAEL and BMD estimates (in this example, the BMD is an exposure concentration, or BMC). The maximum likelihood estimate of the excess risk (of a minimal or higher grade of alveolar septal thick ening) at 0.1 mg/m3 is 0.10 (i.e., 10%), based on the BMD model fitted to the dose-response data in the Pauluhn  study . Yet, 0.1 mg/m3 was identified as a NOAEL based on zero adverse response being observed . In order to assess the precision of the estimate of the excess risk associated with this NOAEL, the likelihood of the data in the NOAEL and control groups was re parameterized in terms of the respective sum and difference of the expected response proportions; and an upper confidence limit for the difference was assessed by inverting its likelihood ratio test statistic. When a nominal confidence coefficient of 95% for a two-sided interval was applied, a value of 0.17 (i.e., 17%) was obtained for the UCL of the difference. Hence, the results supporting the use of 0.1 mg/m3 as a NOAEL are  statistically con sistent with the results from the BMD model since the MLE of excess risk based on the model is less than the UCL.\n【425】 In a standard risk assessment approach, BMDL estimates may be considered equivalent to a NO AEL for use as a POD in risk assessment . Once an effect level is selected in a given ani mal study, it is extrapolated to a human-equivalent effect level (e.g., as 8-hr TWA concentration), or human-equivalent concentration (HEC). This HEC_POD (human-equivalent point-of-departure) is the POD for either extrapolating to a lower (ac ceptable) risk level or applying uncertainty factors in the derivation of an OEL. These steps are discussed further in Section A.6.3.\n【426】 # A . 6 . 3 A l t e r n a t i v e O E L E s t i m a t i o n M e t h o d s\n【427】 As mentioned in the previous section, a standard risk assessment method using animal data typi cally involves first identifying a critical effect level in animals (e.g., NOAEL or BMDL), which is the POD . ,. A HEC POD is estimated by extrapolating anim al j l o the animal dose to humans by accounting for the biological and physical factors that influence the lung dose across species*. Lung dosimetry m od els can account for these interspecies differences and provide equivalent dose estimates in animals and humans given the exposure concentration and duration, the breathing rates and patterns, and the physical properties of the aerosol. A simpli fied standard approach in lieu of a lung dosimetry model to apply a total dosimetric adjustment fac tor to the animal effect level . It is useful to evaluate both approaches given that the lung dosimetry models have not been specifically validated for respirable CNT.  The interspecies NF adjusts for the size difference in the lung (surface area or volume) into which the CNT dose deposits. Studies of other inhaled parti cles or fibers are relevant to evaluating mechanisms that may  apply to CNT in the lungs. Possible dose metrics related to the modes of action for pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis include the CNT mass, surface area, or volume dose per al veolar epithelial cell surface area or alveolar mac rophage cell volume in each species. Normalizing the dose (e.g., NOAEL) across species to the total average alveolar macrophage cell volume in rat or human lungs is based on the experimental observa tion of overloading of alveolar clearance in rats and mice exposed to respirable poorly soluble particles or fibers .\n【428】 # (a) Alveolar macrophage cell volume\n【429】 At a sufficiently high particle dose, pulmonary clearance can become impaired due to overloading of alveolar macrophage-mediated clearance. In rats, the overloading dose has been observed as particle mass (~1 mg/g lung), volume (~1 ^l/g lung for unit density particles) , or surface area (200-300 cm2 particles per rat lung) . On a volume basis, an overloading particle dose corresponds to approxi mately 6%-60% of total alveolar cell volume, when overloading begins and is complete, respectively . The 60% value has been observed experimentally , although particle clearance impairment may start at lower particle volume lung dose . Biological responses to over loading inclu\n【430】 Although the overload mode of action in the rat has been well-studied, the extent to which overloading is involved in human lung responses to inhaled particles is not as clear due to observed differences in both the kinetics and the pattern of particle re tention in the lungs of rats and humans. Whereas particle clearance in rats is first-order at doses be low overloading, studies in workers have shown that human lung clearance of respirable particles is not first-order even at relatively low retained par ticle mass lung low doses . Humans  apparently re tain a greater portion of the particles in the alveolar interstitium, whereas rats retain more particles in the alveolar space . The greater interstitial particle retention may increase the dose to the target tissue for pulmonary fibro sis in humans relative to that for the same depos ited dose in rats lungs. Given the differences in the particle clearance kinetics and retention patterns in rats and humans, normalizing the dose across species based on the total alveolar macrophage vol ume may not be the best dose metric for predicting adverse lung responses in humans.\n【431】 # (b) Alveolar epithelial cell surface area\n【432】 Another dose metric that may be relevant to the in flammatory and fibrotic lung responses is the par ticle or CNT dose per surface area of alveolar epi thelial cells .\n【433】 It is the epithelial cell surface with which particles interact when they migrate through the epithelial cell layer into the interstitium, and epithelial cells are  involved in recruitment of inflammatory and fi brotic cells . For this reason, normal izing the dose based on the total alveolar epithelial cell surface area may be more predictive of the hu man lung response. However, since both the alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells are involved in the lung responses to inhaled particles, some combina tion of dose metrics may ultimately be most predic tive in this dynamic biological system.\n【434】 In the absence of a more complete biologicallybased model, an evaluation of the quantitative in fluence of each assumed dosimetric mode of action (e.g., based on either the alveolar macrophage cell volume or the epithelial cell surface area) provides information on the sensitivity of the risk assess ment and OEL derivation to the interspecies dose normalization factor. Thus, replacing the alveolar macrophage volume ratio in equation A-10 with a NFa/NFr of 0.4m2/102m2  results in a total AF that is 4.5 x greater. That is, Equation A-12: AF = (9.6m3/0.102m x (0.118/0. x (10/ x (0.4m2/102m = 7.7 Equation A-13: HEC_NOAEL = 0.1mg/m3 / 7.7 = 0.013 mg/m3\n【435】 The larger AF results in a corresponding smaller human-equivalent concentration. This illustrates that the risk estimates for CNT-as for other inhaled particles-is sensitive to the assumed mode of ac tion concerning the interspecies normalizing factor.\n【436】 The retained dose to the target tissue is influenced by the clearance mechanism in the lung region in which the particles deposit. RT in equation 2 (as the kinetic factor in Pauluhn ) is intended to account for the differences in the rat and human particle retention half-time. This factor is  de pendent on the assumptions concerning the bio logical mode of action. In the rat, evidence suggests that doses of poorly soluble low toxicity particles below those causing overloading of lung clearance (i.e., at steady-state) would not be associated with adverse lung effects. A steady-state lung burden means that the rate of particle deposition equals the rate of clearance such that once the steady-state burden had been achieved, the lung burden would be the same over time if exposure conditions did not change. For example, if steady-state lung bur den was reached after subchronic (13 week) expo sure to a given exposure concentration, then the chronic (2 yr) lung burden would be the same given the same rates of exposure and clearance. However, the steady-state lung burden may not been entirely reached by 13 weeks in the rat or in an equivalent time in humans. Based on the rat overload mode of action, Pauluhn  assumed that humans would achieve a steady-state lung burden if ex posed at an equivalent total particle volume dose in the alveolar macrophages (over a roughly equiva lent human exposure duration of 10 years to a rat 3 month exposure). A ratio of 10/1 for human/rat retention half-time rate was used , based on a simple first-order clearance rate model of particle clearance from the lungs in both rats and humans . The volumetric dose of CNT associated with overloading in the rat was equivalent to a relatively low mass dose compared to other poorly soluble particles . That is, the human long-term retained lung burden would be expected to exceed a steady-state lung burden predicted from the rat model (i.e., low-dose first order clearance with dose-dependent impairment,\n【437】 # A .6 .3 .2 .2 In te r s p e c ie s D o s e R e te n t io n F a c t o r\n【438】 -r overloading, of particle clearance after reaching a critical lung dose).\n【439】 An alternative approach evaluated was to use the MPPD 2.0  human lung dosimetry model to estimate directly the retained lung burden in humans over a working lifetime. This approach assumes a mode of action in which the cumulative retained particle dose is related to the adverse lung responses, regardless of the dose rate (i.e., the time required to reach that dose). The cumulative exposure concept (concentration x time), known as \"Haber's Law,\" is a typical default assumption in risk assessment for long-term expo sures in the absence of other data . Some studies in workers (coal miners) have shown that the working lifetime cumulative exposure and the retained lung dose are better predictors of pul monary fibrosis than the average exposure concen tration without consideration of duration . Yet, there remains uncertainty about how well a cumulative dose received over a short dura tion may predict the response to the same cumula tive dose received over a longer duration (i.e., at a lower dose rate). The direction of error could go either way, depending on the biological mecha nisms of response. For example, a lower dose rate may allow the lung defense mechanisms to adapt to the exposure (e.g., by increasing clearance or re pair mechanisms), which could reduce the adverse response at a later time point. On the other hand, a longer time in which a substance is in contact with the tissue may exacerbate the response, resulting in a more severe effect at the later time point. The actual lung response may be some combination of these effects.\n【440】 To evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the human and rat retention kinetics, estimates were compared from the MPPD2.0 lung dosimetry model  to the ratio of 10/1 for RTh/RTa used by Pauluhn . The rat and human lung dosimetry models take into account the ventilation rates, the deposition fraction by re spiratory tract region (predicted from particle size and breathing rate and pattern, nasal vs. oronasal), and the normal average clearance rates. Using the particle size and breathing rate values for the Pauluhn 2010a study , the rat retained lung burden at the end of the 13 week exposure to 0.1 mg/m3 was estimated to be ~12 ^g . This is similar to the 8.7 ^g lung burden es timated from the cobalt-tracer based measurement .\n【441】 Assuming that the rat has achieved steady-state lung burden after 13 wk exposure to 0.1 mg/m3, the chronic lung burden should  be approximately 12 ^g.  Extrapolating the rat lung dose of 0.012 mg to the human-equivalent lung burden would result in either:\n【442】 - 13.5 mg-estimated by dividing the rat lung dose by an interspecies NF for the average to tal alveolar macrophage cell volume (i.e., 3.03 x 1010 ^m3/3.49 x 1013 ^m (rat/human); or - 3.0 mg based on the average total alveolar epithelial cell surface area (0.4 m2/102 m (rat/human).\n【443】 The associated 8-hr TWA concentration for 45-yrs would result in human-equivalent lung burdens (es timated from MPPD 2.0 human model ) of 16 ^g/m3 and 3.5 ^g/m3, respec tively, for the normalized lung burdens based on the alveolar macrophage cell volume or the alveolar epithelial cell surface area . The value of 16 ^g/m3 is approximately 3-fold lower than the ~50 ^g/m3 as the human equivalent concentration to the rat NOAEL reported in Pauluhn  (or 3.5 x lower than the 58 ^g/m3 HEC_LOAEL by applying an AF of 1.7 without rounding to . This difference is due to the approximately 3x higher retained lung dose estimates after a 45-year working lifetime (Ta ble A- to that estimated as a 10-year steady-state lung burden . This suggests that the RT of 10 may underestimate the rat to human lung retention kinetics, and that a factor of 35 (i.e., 10 x 3. may be more realistic. Since the MPPD model already takes into account the ventilation rate and deposition fraction, the difference in the human retained lung dose estimates is due to greater At 2 years, the MPPD model predicted a lung burden of 13 ^g and a lung burden plus lung-associated lymph node burden of 23 ^g.\n【444】 particle retention predicted by the MPPD model (which includes the ICRP  clearance model)  compared to that of the first-order kinetic model used to estimate the factor of 10/1 .\n【445】 When this same method was applied to the rat LOAEL of 0.1 mg/m3 in the Ma-Hock  subchronic inhalation study, but using the particle size data and rat minute ventilation specific for that study , similar human-equivalent estimates were obtained. The slightly higher doses are due to the greater DF for the MWCNT in the Ma-Hock  study. In addition, the POD from the Ma-Hock  study is based on a LOAEL (vs. NOAEL in Pauluhn , so an additional uncertainty factor would be applied (as discussed in the next section). In each case, the estimates using an interspecies nor malizing factor based on the alveolar epithelial cell surface area are lower by a factor of approximately four. The estimates in Excess risk estimates based on the short-term studies of SWCNT and MWCNT in rats and mice  are consistent with those from the rat subchronic inhalation studies . However, the uncertainty factors ap plied to the short-term studies would be expected to be higher (e.g., by factor of   than those for the subchronic studies. Alveolar macrophage volume 11.7 13.5 16\n【446】 Alveolar epithelial cell surface area 3.0 3.5\n【447】 Ma-Hock  Alveolar macrophage volume 16.0 18 18 A . 6 . 4 S u m m a r y o f S e n s i t i v i t y\n【448】 A n a l y s e s F i n d i n g s Many of the areas of uncertainty in these risk es timates for CNT  occur in other standard risk assessments based on subchronic or short-term animal study data. Potential chronic effects of CNT are an important area of uncertainty because no chronic study results were available. Uncertainty exists about the estimated lung doses for the in halation studies because of lack of experimental evaluation or validation of lung dosimetry models to predict deposition and retention of CNT. Infor mation is  limited on the relative potency of dif ferent types of CNT to cause specific lung effects in animals because of study differences. Despite the variability in the risk estimates across the various types of CNT, all of the risk estimates were associ ated with low-mass concentrations (below the up per and lower LOQ or 7 or 1 ^g/m3, respectively).\n【449】 In conclusion, these sensitivity analyses show that the estimates of a health-based OEL are not strong ly dependent on the BMD-based risk assessment methods, and the use of an alternative (POD/UF) method provides supporting evidence indicating the need for a high level of exposure containment and control for all types of CNT.\n【450】 # A.7 Evaluation of Carbon Nanofiber Studies in Mice and Rats\n【451】 Two in vivo studies of carbon nanofibers (CNF) have been recently published in mice and rats . In order to compare the lung responses to CNF observed in these studies, estimates of the lung doses normalized across species are provided in this section.  A . 7 . 1 P a r t i c l e C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s Both types of CNF were vapor grown, but obtained from different sources. In Murray , the CNF was supplied by Pyrograf Products, Inc. The chemical composition was 98.6% wt. elemental car bon and 1.4% wt. iron. CNF structures were 80 to 160 nm in diameter, and 5 to 30 ^m in length. The specific surface area (SSA) measured by BET was 35 45 m2/g; the effective SSA was estimated as ~21 m2/g . In DeLorme , the CNF was supplied by Showa Denko KK, Tokyo, Japan. The chemical composition was >99.5% car bon, 0.03% oxygen and < 0.003% iron. CNF struc tures were 40-350 nm (158 nm average) in diameter and 1-14 ^m in length (5.8 ^m average). The BET SSA was 13.8 m2/g .\n【452】 # A . 7 . 2 E x p e r i m e n t a l D e s i g n a n d A n i m a l s\n【453】 The species and route of exposure  differed in the two studies. In Murray , six female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 wk of age, 20.0 + 1.9 g body weight) were administered a single dose (120 ^g) of CNF by pharyngeal aspiration ; mice were examined at 1, 7, and 28 days post-ex posure. In DeLorme , female and male Crl:CD Sprague Dawley rats (5 wk of age) were ex posed to CNF by nose-only inhalation at exposure concentrations of 0, 0.54, 2.5, or 25 mg/m3 (6 hr/d, 5 d/wk, 13 wk). The rats were examined 1-d after the end of the 13-wk exposure and 3 months post exposure. Body weights were reported as: 252 g + 21.2 female; 520 g + 63.6 male (unexposed con trols, 1-d post-exposure); 329 g + 42.2 female; 684 g + 45.8 male (unexposed controls, 3 mo. post-ex posure) .\n【454】 # A . 7 . 3 L u n g R e s p o n s e s\n【455】 In mice, the lung responses to CNF included pul monary inflammation (polymorphonuclear lym phocytes, PMNs, measured in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid, BALF); PMN accumulation in CNFexposed mice was 150-fold vs. controls on day 1. By day 28 post-exposure, PMNs in BALF of CNFexposed mice had decreased to 25-fold vs. controls. Additional lung effects included increased lung permeability (elevated total protein in BALF), cy totoxicity (elevated lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), which remained significantly elevated compared to controls at day 28 post-exposure. Oxidative dam age (elevated 4-hydroxynonenol, 4-HNE, and oxi datively modified proteins, i.e., protein carbonyls) was significantly elevated at days 1 and 7, but not at day 28. Collagen accumulation at day 28 post exposure was 3-fold higher in CNF-exposed mice vs. controls by biochemical measurements. Consis tent with the biochemical changes, morphometric measurement of Sirius red-positive type I and III collagen in alveolar walls (septa) was significant ly greater than controls at day 28 post-exposure .\n【456】 In rats, the respiratory effects observed in the De Lorme study  were qualitatively similar to those found in the Murray et al study . The wet lung weights were significantly elevated com pared to controls in male rats at 25 mg/m3 CNF and in female rats at 2.5 and 25 mg/m3 CNF at 1-day post-exposure; lung weights remained elevated in each sex in the 25 mg/m3 exposure group at 3 mo. post-exposure. Histopathologic changes at 1 day post-exposure included inflammation in the ter minal bronchiolar and alveolar duct region in the 2.5 and 25 mg/m3 exposure groups, and interstitial thickening with type II pneumocyte proliferation in the 25 mg/m3 exposure group. Cell proliferation assays confirmed increased cell proliferation in that highest dose group in the subpleural, parenchymal and terminal bronchiolar region; the subpleural proliferation in this dose group did not resolve in the females by the end of the 3 month recovery pe riod. Cell proliferation appeared to resolve in males after a 3 month recovery period but numerically re mained higher in the parenchyma and subpleural regions. Histopathologic evidence of inflamma tion and the presence of fiber-laden macrophages were reported to be reduced but still present in the high dose group after a 3 month recovery period. Inflammation within the alveolar space (as mea sured by PMN levels in BALF) was statistically sig nificant only in the rats exposed to 25 mg/m3 CNF. However, the percent PMNs increased in a dose responsive manner: 1.2 (± 0., 1.4 (± 0., 2.7 (± 0., and (± 2., respectively, in the 0, 0.54, 2.5, and 25 mg/m3 exposure groups. LDH and other BALF markers were elevated at the end of the 13wk exposure only in the 25 mg/m3 exposure group, and LDH remained elevated at 3-mo. post-exposure in that group. The observed no adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats was reported to be 0.54 mg/m3. The lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was reported to be 2.5 mg/m3 \"based on the minimal inflammation observed in terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts of male and female r a t s . \" .\n【457】 The sample size and sensitivity of the markers or assays are factors that could influence the statisti cal power and likelihood of observing exposurerelated effects in these animal studies. In Murray , six animals per group were used for the BAL analysis, histopathology evaluation, oxi dative stress markers, and lung collagen measure ments. Five animals per group were used for the BAL and cell proliferation assays in the DeLorme  study (male and female data were ana lyzed separately). The Murray  study used a more sensitive marker of interstitial fibrosis in measuring the average thickness of the alveolar connective tissue, while the DeLorme  study did not report using that assay.\n【458】 # A . 7 . 4 E f f e c t s i n O t h e r T i s s u e s\n【459】 In rats, CNF were observed in the nasal turbi nates of the high-dose group (25 mg/m at 1 day post-exposure, which was accompanied by hyaline droplet formation in the epithelium; CNF persist ed in the nasal turbinates at 3-mo. post-exposure in the high dose group . In all exposure groups, CNF translocated to the tra cheobronchial lymph nodes and CNF fibers were seen in brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, intestinal tract, kidneys, and mediastinal lymph nodes, but no associated histopathologic abnormalities were detected . In CNF-exposed mice, T cell mitogen (concavalin A) responsiveness In order to quantitatively compare the results of the two CNF studies in mice and rats, equivalent lung doses were estimated by accounting for differences in route of exposure and particle size characteris tics and by normalizing to either the mass or al veolar surface area of the lungs in each species. The respiratory tract region where the adverse effects were observed is the pulmonary (a.k.a. alveolar) re gion, which is where gas exchange occurs between the lungs and blood circulatory system across the alveolar septal walls. In mice, the lung dose esti mate is simply the proportion of the administered dose (by pharyngeal aspiration)  that is estimated to deposit in the alveolar re gion. Mercer  reported that 81% of the aspirated MWCNT by pharyngeal aspiration de posited in the alveolar region of the mouse. If this figure applies to the CNF reported in Murray , then approximately 97 ^g of the 120 ^g ad ministered dose would be deposited in the alveolar region. In the absence of CNF-specific data, 100% alveolar deposition of the administered dose was  assumed.\n【460】 In rats, the airborne particle size data are used to estimate the inhalable, deposited, and retained lung doses of CNT, based on the exposure concen trations and particle size characteristics reported . The multipath particle de position model (MPPD), version 2.90 , was used to estimate these lung doses. MPPD ver sion 2.11 was originally used to obtain some parti cle deposition estimates, but some output indicated errors in estimating the tracheobronchial regional deposited dose, which appeared to lower the alveo lar deposition estimates. This issue was apparently resolved in the updated version (2..\n【461】 Particle characteristic input values used in MPPD include the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and density. The following MMAD and GSD val ues were reported by airborne exposure concen trations: 0.54 mg/m3 (MMAD 1.9 ^m; GSD 3.; 2.5 mg/m3 (MMAD 3.2 ^m; GSD 2.; and mg/ m3 (MMAD 3.3 ^m; GSD 2.. The density assumed for this CNF is 0.08 g/ml. Density was not reported in DeLorme  and was obtained from the manufacturer's data analysis sheet, which in dicates it is the same material as that reported in DeLorme .\n【462】 The default breathing rates and parameters were assumed, and inhalability adjustment was selected. In MPPD 2.90, nonspherical particle shape can be taken into account in the respiratory tract deposi tion estimates, but some of the required input pa rameters (GSD of structure diameter and length and correlation) were not reported in DeLorme . So, the spherical particle assump tion (aspect ratio of 1. was assumed, which may not be unreasonable given that the fiber intercep tion mechanism may be less for CNF structures of length 5.8 ^m than for longer fibers. The default breathing parameters (including 0.21 ml tidal vol ume and 102 breaths/min) may be reasonable for the female Sprague Dawley rats in the DeLorme  study based on similar body weight (300 g) associated with the default values , but may be too low for the male Sprague Dawley rats. The average body weights in control rats (air-only exposed) at the end of 13-wk exposure period and the 90-d post-exposure pe riod, respectively, were: 252 and 329 g (females); 520 and 684 g (males) . The retained lung burden at the end of the 13-wk ex posure was  estimated in MPPD 2.90 using the particle size data for each exposure concentration (using MMAD and GSD values reported above).\n【463】 The lung dose estimates in rats and mice were nor malized by the lung weight or alveolar surface area to estimate the equivalent dose across species. The aver age lung weights of rats were those reported in DeLo rme  1-d post-exposure in the control rats (1.9 g and 1.3 g in males and females, respectively). The average mouse lung weight was 0.15 g . The average alveolar surface area assumed for the rat lungs was 0.4 m2 , and that of mice was 0.055 m2 .\n【464】 The total deposited CNF dose in the alveolar region was estimated in rats in the DeLorme  study in the following equation: The inhalable fraction estimates of CNF in rats were 0.79, 0.73, and 0.72, respectively, in rats at the re ported particles sizes for concentrations of 0.54 mg/ m3 . The alveolar deposition fraction estimates were 0.0715, 0.0608, and 0.054, respectively, for the 0.54, 2.5, and 25 mg/m3 exposure concentrations.\n【465】 The normalized dose estimates in mice and rats (as CNF mass per alveolar surface area or mass of lungs) and associated lung responses are shown in Tables A-15 and A-16. In mice, these lung dose es timates are similar to or higher than the deposited lung dose estimate in the rat at the LOAEL (2.5 mg/ m, but less than the deposited lung doses estimat ed in rats at the highest concentration (25 mg/m . The mouse deposited lung burden estimates are higher than the rat retained lung burden estimates at all doses, assuming spherical-particle model clearance in MPPD 2.90 . If CNF is cleared in a similar manner as that reported for MWCNT in Pauluhn , the ac tual retained lung dose in rats may be intermediate between the estimated deposited and retained lung burdens. Thus, the mouse fibrotic lung response was observed at an administered lung dose that was similar to, or higher than, the rat lung doses estimated at the LOAEL. This suggests a roughly similar dose-response relationship in the rat and mouse lungs to CNT, based on the limited data in these two studies.\n【466】 As discussed above , the mouse lung responses to CNF (at a 120 ^g dose) included al veolar septal thickening identified as pulmonary fibrosis based on collagen deposition observed by Sirius Red staining and the measured thickness of the alveolar connective (septal) tissue . In the DeLorme  study, similar qualitative lung responses were observed at the 25 mg/m3 (as discussed in Section A.7.. The DeLorme  did not report fibrosis at 25 mg/m3 although the description of the responses is consistent with early stage fibrosis reported in the Murray .\n【467】 NOAELs were reported for one type of CNF in De Lorme  and for one type of MWCNT in Pauluhn , which were 0.1 and 0.54 mg/m3, respectively. It follows that the human-equivalent working lifetime exposure estimates to the NO-AEL would be roughly 5-fold higher for the CNF than that for the MWCNT (although not exactly, due to particle size differences and lung deposition estimates). Table A-13 shows estimates of humanequivalent concentrations to effect levels in the Pau luhn and Ma-Hock subchronic inhalation studies, based on different assumptions in extrapolating the rat lung dose to humans. The application of uncer tainty factors (e.g., Table A - with the CNF used in the DeLorme  study would result in estimated working lifetime no-effect levels in hu mans of roughly 1-4 ^g/m3.  fIn rats, the pulmonary deposition fraction and 13-wk retained lung burdens were estimated from MPPD 2.9 . *In mice, this estimate assumes 100% alveolar deposition of the administered by pharyngeal aspiration. If 81% alveolar deposition is assumed as for MWCNT , this estimate would be 1.8 mg/m2 lung. fIn rats, the pulmonary deposition fraction and 13-wk retained lung burdens were estimated from MPPD 2.9 . *In mice, this estimate assumes 100% alveolar deposition of the administered by pharyngeal aspiration. If 81% alveolar deposition is assumed as for MWCNT , this estimate would be 0.65 mg/g lung.

Such an assessment may come from databases, texts, and published literature or available regulations or guide lines (e.g., from NIOSH or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ).\n【470】 Human studies, such as epidemiologic in vestigations and case series or reports, and animal studies may  provide valuable in formation. In most instances involving CNT there are limited toxicological data and a lack of epidemiologic data with which to make a complete hazard assessment.\n【471】 - The exposure assessment involves evaluating relevant exposure routes (inhalation, ingestion, dermal, and/or injection), amount, duration, and frequency (i.e., dose), as well as whether exposure controls are in place and how pro tective they are. When data are not available, this will be a qualitative process.\n【472】 B . 2 M e d i c a l S u r v e i l l a n c e Medical surveillance targets actual health events or a change in a biologic function of an exposed person or persons. Medical surveillance involves the ongoing evaluation of the health status of a group of workers through the collection and ag gregate analysis of health data for the purpose of preventing disease and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs (primary prevention). NIOSH recommends the medical surveillance of workers when they are exposed to hazardous ma terials, and therefore are at risk of adverse health effects from such exposures. Medical screening is one form of medical surveillance that is designed to detect early signs of work-related illness in indi vidual workers by administering tests to apparently healthy persons to detect those with early stages of disease or risk of disease. Medical screening gener ally represents secondary prevention.\n【473】 Medical surveillance is a second line of defense behind the implementation of engineering, ad ministrative, and work practice controls (includ ing personal protective equipment). Integration of hazard and medical surveillance is important to an effective occupational health surveillance pro gram, and surveillance of disease or illness should not proceed without having a hazard surveillance program in place.\n【474】 # B.2.1 Planning and C onducting Medical Surveillance\n【475】 Important factors when considering medical sur veillance include the following:\n【476】 1. A clearly defined purpose or objective.\n【477】 2. A clearly defined target population.\n【478】 3. The availability of testing modalities to accom plish the defined objective. Testing modalities may include such tools as questionnaires, physi cal examinations, and medical testing.\n【479】 A clear plan should be established before beginning a medical surveillance program. The plan should include the following:\n【480】 1. A rationale for the type of medical surveillance.\n【481】 2. Provisions for interpreting the results.\n【482】 3. Presentation of the findings to workers and management of the affected workplace.\n【483】 4. Implementation of all the other steps of a complete medical surveillance program .\n【484】 The elements for conducting a medical surveillance program generally include the following:\n【485】 1. An initial medical examination and collection of medical and occupational histories.\n【486】 2.

The analysis quantifies total carbon (TC) in a sample as the sum of OC and EC. The method was developed to measure diesel particulate matter (DPM) in oc cupational settings, but it can be applied to other types of carbonaceous aerosols. It is widely used for environmental and occupational monitoring.\n【492】 For the thermal-optical analysis, a portion (typi cally a 1.5-cm2 rectangular punch) of a quartz-fiber filter sample is removed and placed on a small quartz spatula. The spatula is inserted in the instru ment's sample oven, and the oven is tightly sealed. Quartz-fiber filters are required for sample collec tion because temperatures of 850 °C and higher are employed during the analysis. The thermal-optical analyzer is equipped with a pulsed diode laser and photo detector that permit continuous monitoring of the filter transmittance. This optical feature cor rects for the \"char\" that forms during the analysis because of carbonization of some materials.\n【493】 Thermal-optical analysis proceeds in inert and oxi dizing atmospheres. In both, the evolved carbon is catalytically oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO. The CO2 is then reduced to methane (CH, and CH4 is quantified with a flame ionization detector (FID). The OC (and carbonate, if present) is first removed in helium, as the temperature is increased to a pre set maximum. If sample charring occurs, the fil ter transmittance decreases as the temperature is stepped to the maximum. After the OC is removed in helium, an oxygen-helium mix is introduced, and the temperature is again stepped to a maxi mum (850 °C or higher, depending on the sample) to effect combustion of the remaining material. As the light-absorbing carbon (mainly EC and char) is oxidized from the filter, the filter transm it tance increases. The split between the OC and EC is assigned when the initial (baseline) value of the filter transmittance is reached. All carbon removed before the OC-EC split is considered organic, and that removed after the split is considered elemental.\n【494】 If no charring occurs, the split is assigned before removal of EC. If the sample chars, the split is not assigned until enough light-absorbing carbon is removed to increase the transmittance to its ini tial value.\n【495】 OC and EC results are reported as micrograms per square centimeter (^g/cm of sample deposit.\n【496】 The total OC and EC on the filter are calculated by multiplying the reported values by the deposit area.\n【497】 Because only a portion of the sample is analyzed, it must be representative of the entire deposit. Thus, a homogeneous deposit is assumed. The entire filter must be analyzed (in portions if a 37-mm filter is used) if the filter deposit is uneven.\n【498】 # C . 2 M e t h o d E v a l u a t i o n\n【499】 The reported accuracy of NIOSH 5040 is based on analysis of TC in different sample types. Accuracy was based on TC, because there is no analytical standard for determining the OC-EC content of a complex carbonaceous aerosol. In the method eval uation, five different organic compounds were ana lyzed to examine whether the instrument response is compound dependent. Linear regression of the data (43 analyses total) for all five compounds gave a slope and correlation coefficient (r) near unity , indicating a compound-independent response. Eight different carbonaceous materials  were analyzed by three methods, in-house by thermal-optical analysis and by two other methods used by two external labora tories. Sample materials included, DPM, coals, ur ban dust, and humic acid. Thermal-optical results agreed well with those reported by the two other laboratories. The variability of the TC results for the three laboratories ranged from about 1%-7%. These findings  demonstrate that carbon can be accurately quantified irrespec tive of the compound or sample type.\n【500】 In sampling DPM, different samplers gave compa rable EC results because particles from combustion sources are generally less than one ^m (diameter).\n【501】 As such, the particles are collected with high ef ficiency (near 100%) and evenly deposited on the filter. In the method evaluation, different sampler types (open-face 25-mm and 37-mm cassettes, 298 personal cascade impactors, and four proto type impactors) were used to collect diesel exhaust aerosol at an express mail facility. The relative stan dard deviation (RSD) for the mean EC concentra tion was 5.6% . Based on the 95% confidence limit (19%; 13 degrees of freedom, n =  on the accuracy, the NIOSH accuracy cri terion  was fulfilled. Variabil ity for the OC results was higher (RSD = 12.3%), which is to be expected when different samplers are used to collect aerosols that contain semi-volatile (and volatile) components, because these may have a filter face velocity dependence. The method pre cision (RSD) for triplicate analyses (1.5 cm2 filter portions) of a 37-mm quartz-fiber filter sample of DPM was normally better than 5%, and often 2% or less .\n【502】 In the method evaluation, the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated two ways:  through analy sis of low-level calibration standards , and  through analysis of pre-cleaned media blanks. In the first approach, OC standard solutions (sucrose and ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid ) covering a range from 0.23 to 2.82 ^g C (or from 0.15 to 1.83 ^g C per cm2 of filter) were analyzed. An aliquot (usually 10 ^L) of the standard was applied to one end of a 1.5-cm2 rectangular filter portion that was pre-cleaned in the sample oven just before application of the aliquot. The filter portion was pre-cleaned to remove any OC contamination, which can greatly increase the EC LOD when TC results are used for its estimation.\n【503】 After cleaning the filter portion, metal tweezers are used to remove from the sample oven the quartz spatula that holds the portion. External to the oven, the spatula is held in place by a metal bracket such that the standard can be applied without removing the filter portion from the spatula. This avoids po tential contamination from handling.\n【504】 Results of linear regression of the low-level calibra tion data were used to calculate the LOD as 3 oy/m, where oy is the standard error of the regression and m is the slope of the regression line. TC results were used rather than OC because the pyrolysis correc tion may not account for all of the char formed during analysis of the standard (because of low sample loading and/or the position of the aliquot in the laser). If not, a small amount of the OC will be reported as EC, introducing variability in the OC results and increasing the LOD. The LOD es timated through the linear regression results was 0.24 ^g C per filter portion, or 0.15 ^g/cm2.\n【505】 A simpler approach for LOD determination is through analysis of media blanks. In the method evaluation, TC results for pre-cleaned, 1.5-cm2 portions of the filter media were used to calculate the LOD estimate. The mean (n =  TC blank was 0.03 ±0.1 ^g TC. Thus, the LOD estimated as three times the standard deviation for pre-cleaned media blanks (3 o blank) was about 0.3 ^g C. This result agrees well with the value (0.24 ^g C) esti mated through analysis of the standard solutions.\n【506】 Considering a 960-L air sample collected on a 37 mm filter and a 1.5-cm2 sample portion, this LOD translates to an air concentration of about 2 ^g/m3 ( /0.960 m3 = 1.78 ^g/ m, corresponding to the reported upper LOQ of about 7 ^g/m3 (LOQ = 3.3 x LOD).\n【507】 As with all analytical methods, the LOD is a vary ing number. However, the EC LOD (about 2 ^g/m3, or an LOQ of 7 ^g/m reported for NIOSH Meth od 5040 is a high estimate. As discussed in Sec tion 6 of the CIB, it was based on analysis of pre cleaned media blanks from different filter lots, over a 6-month period, and by different analysts at two different laboratories. Further, variability for the TC results, rather than the EC results, was used to estimate the LOD. These combined factors gave a conservative (high) estimate of the EC LOD. More typical values, under different sampling conditions, are discussed in 1 of the CIB. When results of the initial m ethod evaluation were published , an inter laboratory comparison was not possible because the thermal-optical instrument was available in only one laboratory. After additional laboratories acquired thermal-optical instruments, a round robin comparison  was conducted. Matched sets of filter samples containing different types of complex carbonaceous aerosols were dis tributed to 11 laboratories. Six of the eleven ana lyzed the samples according to NIOSH 5040, while five used purely thermal (i.e., no char correction) methods. Good interlaboratory agreement was ob tained among the six laboratories that used NIOSH 5040. In the analysis of samples containing DPM, the variability (RSD) for the EC results ranged from 6% to 9%. Only low EC fractions were found in wood and cigarette smoke. Thus, these materials pose minimal interference in the analysis of EC. In addition, only minor amounts of EC were found in two OC standards that char: about 1% for sucrose and 0.1% for the disodium salt of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Two aqueous solutions of OC standards were included in the comparison as a check on the validity of the char correction and accuracy of the TC results. Variability (RSD) of the TC results for the two standard solutions and five filter samples ranged from 3% to 6%.\n【508】 A second interlaboratory comparison study using NIOSH 5040 was  conducted . Seven environmental aerosol samples were analyzed in duplicate by eight laboratories. Four samples were collected in U.S. cities, and three were collected in Asia. Interlaboratory variability for the EC results ranged from 6% to 21% for six samples having EC loadings from 0.7 to 8.4 ^g/cm2. Four of the six had low EC loadings (0.7 ^g/cm2 to 1.4 ^g/ cm. The variability for the OC results ranged from 4% to 13% , the sample should be acidified.\n【509】 C . 5 O r g a n i c C a r b o n S a m p l i n g A r t i f a c t s Problems commonly referred to as 'sampling artifacts\" have been reported when collecting particu late OC on quartz fiber filters. These artifacts do not affect the EC results, but they cause positive or negative bias in the measurement of particulate OC (and TC). Eatough  observed loss of semi-volatile OC from particles during sampling, referred to as the \"negative\" or evaporation artifact. This artifact causes a negative bias in the particu late OC (and TC) concentration, because OC ini tially collected as condensed matter is subsequently lost through evaporation from the filter during sampling. Conversely, several studies have demon strated a \"positive\" or adsorption artifact because of filter adsorption of gas phase OC. A quartz-fiber filter collects airborne particulate matter and allows gases and vapors to pass through, but some adsorp tion of gas phase (and vapor) OC occurs, resulting in overestimation of the true airborne particulate OC concentration .\n【510】 Most of the studies on sampling artifacts apply to environmental air sampling. Occupational sampling methods and conditions are generally much differ ent than environmental. Environmental samples are usually collected at much higher face velocities: 20-80 cm/s as opposed to 3-4 cm/s for occupational samples. In addition, the concentrations of carbon are much lower in environmental air than in most occupational settings , and the types of aerosols sampled are different (e.g., aged aerosol from multiple envi ronmental sources, as opposed to aerosols close to source). These differences are important because OC sampling artifacts depend upon conditions such as filter face velocity, air contaminants pres ent, sampling time, and filter media. Given the much lower filter face velocities typical of occupa tional sampling, adsorption (i.e., positive artifact) is expected over evaporation for occupational sam ples. Turpin , Kirchstetter , Noll andBirch , and Schauer  have reported adsorption as the dominant artifact.\n【511】 To correct for the positive adsorption artifact, tan dem quartz filters have been applied. When sam pling with tandem filters, particulate matter is collected by the first filter, while both the first and second filters are exposed to and adsorb gaseous and vaporous OC. For the correction to be effec tive, both filters must be in equilibrium with the sampled airstream, adsorb the same amount of gas/ vapor OC, and not have a significant amount of OC loss through evaporation. The OC on the second filter can then be subtracted from the OC on the first filter to account for the adsorbed OC. Several studies have found the tandem filter correction to underestimate the adsorption artifact , while others have shown effective correction .\n【512】 Air samplers containing a Teflon and quartz filter  have been used for correction of the positive OC artifact. In theory, the Teflon top filter collects particulate matter with negligible OC gas/vapor adsorption, so only the quartz filter beneath it ad sorbs gas and vapor OC. Studies on tandem filter corrections have shown the quartz filter beneath Teflon to have a greater OC value than quartz be neath quartz . This finding was attributed to the quartz beneath quartz not reaching equilibrium with the sampling stream and underestimating the adsorp tion artifact. Others have attributed it to the evapo ration artifact being more prevalent when using a Teflon filter instead of a quartz filter, and they re ported the quartz behind Teflon to overestimate the adsorption artifact .\n【513】 Several studies have shown no difference when us ing either type of correction .\n【514】 Noll and Birch  conducted studies on OC sampling artifacts for occupational samples to test the accuracy of the tandem quartz-filter correction.\n【515】 In practice, using two quartz filters for air sampling is preferable to the Teflon-quartz combination be cause both the collection and blank filters are in the same sampler. The tandem quartz correction effectively reduced positive bias for both labora tory and field samples. Laboratory samples were collected under conditions that simulated DPM sampling in underground mines. Without correc tion, TC on the sample filter was 30% higher than the actual particulate TC for 50% of the samples, but it was within 11% of the particulate TC after the tandem quartz-fiber correction. For field samples, this correction significantly reduced positive bias due to OC adsorption artifact. Little artifact effect was found after the correction was made. Method 5040 was developed to measure DPM in occupational environments, but it can be applied to other types of carbonaceous aerosols. When ap plied to materials such as carbon black or CNT/ CNF, particle deposition on a filter may be more variable because particles in these materials are much larger than DPM. Variability depends on the sampler type, and as expected, different samplers (e.g., cyclones, open-and closed-face cassettes) will give different air concentration results, depending on the particle size distribution . Diesel emissions, and combustion aerosols gener ally, are composed of ultrafine (< 100 nm diame ters) particles. Because of the small size, DPM nor mally deposits evenly across the quartz-fiber filter used for sample collection. As already discussed, even deposition is required because only a portion of the filter is normally analyzed. Thus, it must be representative of the entire sample deposit.\n【516】 When applying NIOSH 5040 to CNT/CNF, it is important to verify an even filter deposit so that an accurate air concentration (based on results for the filter portion) can be calculated. Alternatively, the entire filter can be analyzed if the deposit is un even, but this requires analysis of multiple portions of a 37-mm filter because of the relatively small di ameter (about 1 cm) of the carbon analyzer's quartz sample oven. Quality assurance procedures should include duplicate analyses of the 37-mm filter to check precision, especially if the deposit appears uneven. If a 25-mm filter is used, the entire filter can be analyzed, which improves the LOD and obviates the need for an even deposit, but a repeat analysis (or other chemical analysis) of the sample is not possible if the entire filter is analyzed. In ad dition, the filter must be cut into portions, and the portions must be properly loaded in the analyzer so the sample transmittance can be monitored. Additional details on the evaluation and use of NIOSH 5040 are provided elsewhere .\n【517】 As discussed in the CIB, NIOSH 5040 has been ap plied to several field studies on CNT/CNF .\n【518】 In one study, it was employed for area monitoring at a laboratory facility that processes CNF in the production of polymer composites . Carbon nanofibers and CNT have negligible (if any) OC content, making EC a good indicator of these materials. Survey results were reported in terms of TC, which is subject to OC interferences, but the OC results were blank corrected by the tan dem filter method described in the preceding sec tion (organic carbon adsorption artifacts) to mini mize the positive sampling artifact. Further, based on the thermal profiles for the air samples and the bulk materials (CNF and composite product), the blank-corrected TC was a good measure of the CNF air concentration, except in an area where a wet saw was operating. In that area, TC was a mea sure of the composite aerosol released during the sawing operation, which contained a high OC frac tion due to the composite matrix.\n【519】 There are several issues and limitations when ana lyzing dusts generated during cutting, sanding, or grinding CNT/CNF composites. First, the accu racy of determining the EC fraction of a polymer composite is questionable and expected to vary, de pending on polymer type and sample loading. Fur ther, EC in both the polymer and bulk CNT/CNF materials will be measured (i.e., not speciated) if both are present. In addition, the EC loading in a polymer composite is usually a low percentage (e.g., 1%). Therefore, if the composite dust is the only EC source, and if its EC content is determined accurately, an EC concentration of 2 ^g/m3 would correspond to a dust concentration (at 1% EC) of 200 ^g/m3, considerably higher than the EC concentration. As such, the sample can be easily overloaded with OC because of the high relative OC content, which can both overload the analyzer and cause positive bias in the EC result. Further, in a composite particle, the CNT/CNF is bound within a polymer (or resin) matrix, which is dissimilar to a particle of unbound material. An effort to improve the analysis of sam ples containing dusts of polymer composites is on going; however, in the context of the NIOSH REL, the intended application is CNT/CNF in powder form, purified or unpurified. Whenever possible, a bulk sample of the material (and, if available, other materials that may be aerosolized) should be ana lyzed as the thermal properties of CNT/CNF are material dependent (e.g., CNF, SWCNT, MWCNT, functionalized or not functionalized). The OC-EC split for a bulk material is not reliable because it depends on how the powder is applied to the filter punch, but a small amount of the CNT/CNF should be analyzed to determine the onset of oxidation of the material and confirm its complete oxidation.\n【520】 NIOSH investigators  conducted extensive air monitoring at a facility that manufactures and pro cesses CNFs . Both personal breathing zone and area samples were collected. To evaluate the method precision, paired samples were collected and repeat analyses of the filters were performed. The relative percent difference (RPD) and RSD (%) for repeat analyses of 12 samples collected in different areas of the facility are listed in  Total, thoracic, and respirable dust samples are included. Total (inhalable equivalent) dust was collected with 37-mm cassettes, while cyclones were used to collect tho racic and respirable dust. The RPD was determined by analyzing either two punches from the same filter (duplicates) or one punch from two different filters (paired samplers); the RSD was determined by analyzing one filter in triplicate. The precision for the EC results ranged from about 3% to 14% except for one respirable sample, where the RPD was about 22%. Higher variability for the latter may relate to spatial variation, because the two fil ter punches analyzed were from different samplers. Spatial variation, rather than sampler variability, is a likely explanation for this particular result as two other sets of paired samplers do not show higher variability. The RPDs for these are about 8% and 13%, comparable to results for multiple punches from the same filter.\n【521】 # Delivering on the N ation's promise: safety and health a t work for a ll people through research and prevention\n【522】 To receive NIOSH documents or more information about\n", "seq_id": 356, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余空格#11#11#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#24#24#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#26#26#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#47#47#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#56#56#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#81#81#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#94#94#单词间多余空格\n多余换行#109#109#接上一段\n多余空格#136#136#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#137#137#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#141#141#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#147#147#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#193#193#首句单词间多余空格\n多余空格#210#210#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#229#229#单词间多余空格\n多余空格#234#234#单词间多余空格\n#242#242#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#247#247#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#263#263#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#273#273#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#284#284#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#312#312#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#321#321#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#382#382#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#387#387#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#393#393#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#419#419#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#426#426#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#437#437#单词间多余空格\n缺少换行#445#445#最后一句另起一行\n多余空格\n#447#447#最后一个单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#448#448#首句单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#452#452#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#454#454#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#458#458#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#472#472#首句单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#498#498#单词间多余空格\n多余空格\n#509#509#首句单词间多余空格", "type3": "无关文本#0#0#最1两句与文本无关\n无关文本#16#16#Erdely 2009]内容与文本无关\n无关文本#18#18# ( and Appendix A)内容与文本无关\n无关文本#21#21# (1, Appendix C)内容与文本无关\n无关文本#21#21# (1…内容与文本无关\n无关文本#114#114# F ig u re 2 -1内容与文本无关\n无关文本#170#170#(Appendix C)内容与文本无关\n无关文本#176#176#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#177#177#).内容与文本无关\n无关文本#193#193#(Appendix A, Table A-内容与文本无关\n无关文本#209#209#As described above (6.1.,内容与文本无关\n无关文本#317#317#[personal communication, O内容与文本无关\n无关文本#328#328#(Sec tion A.2…内容与文本无关\n无关文本#338#338#Table A-1内容与文本无关\n无关文本#365#365#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#367#367#Appendix C; Tables A-3 through A-内容与文本无关\n无关文本#460#460#(2…内容与文本无关\n无关文本#521#522#内容与文本无关", "type4": "语义不完整#12#12#最后一句话没说完\n语义不完整#146#146#最后一句话没说完\n语义不完整#231#231#最后一句话没说完\n语义不完整#489#489#缺少序号5.", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-18 00:04:11"}

Energy is often defined as the ability to do work.\n【2】 Several different forms of energy, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, nuclear, and mass have been defined to explain all known natural phenomena.\n【3】 Energy is converted from one form to another, but it is never created or destroyed. This principle, the conservation of energy, was first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. According to Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\n【4】 Although the total energy of a system does not change with time, its value may depend on the frame of reference.  For example, a seated passenger in a moving airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane, but nonzero kinetic energy relative to the earth.\n【5】 # History\n【6】 The concept of energy emerged out of the idea of vis viva, which Leibniz defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view shared by Isaac Newton, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted.  In 1807, Thomas Young was the first to use the term \"energy\", instead of vis viva, in its modern sense. Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"kinetic energy\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"potential energy.\"\n【7】 It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the caloric) or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum.\n【8】 He amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of thermodynamics, which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs and Walther Nernst. It  led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius, and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan.\n【9】 During a 1961 lecture for undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology, Richard Feynman, a celebrated physics teacher and Nobel Laureate, said this about the concept of energy:\n【10】 Since 1918 it has been known that  the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time. That is, energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time  Noether's theorem).\n【11】 # Energy in various contexts since the beginning of the universe\n【12】 The concept of energy and its transformations is extremely  useful in explaining and predicting most natural phenomena. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often described by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations, since in practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.\n【13】 The concept of energy is used often in all fields of science.\n【14】 Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"released\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"stored\" in heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium), using the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae, which created these elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. Heat from such nuclear decay in the core of the Earth releases heat, which in turn may lift mountains via orogenesis. This lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage, which may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes  release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store which has been produced ultimately from the same heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy stored since the collapse of long-destroyed stars.\n【15】 In another similar chain of transformations from the dawn of the universe, nuclear fussion of hydrogen in the Sun releases potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang, when according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. Energy from this fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the energy is transformed to sunlight. Such sunlight from our Sun may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, when (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight  drives all weather phenomenon, including violent events triggered when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddently to power a few days of hurricanes. Sunlight is  is captured by plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. This energy may be triggered suddenly by a spark in a forest fire; or may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these tranformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat.\n【16】 # Regarding applications of the concept of energy\n【17】 Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.\n【18】 - The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways.  For example, it is sometimes convenient to distinguish potential energy (which is a function of coordinates only) from kinetic energy (which is a function of coordinate time derivatives only).  It may  be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, electric energy, thermal energy, and other forms.  These classifications overlap;  for instance thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy.\n【19】 - The transfer of energy can take various forms;  familiar examples include work, heat flow, and advection, as discussed below.\n【20】 - The word \"energy\" is  used outside of physics in many ways, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency. The vernacular terminology is not consistent with technical terminology.  For example, the important public-service announcement, \"Please conserve energy\" uses vernacular notions of \"conservation\" and \"energy\" which make sense in their own context but are utterly incompatible with the technical notions of \"conservation\" and \"energy\" (such as are used in the law of conservation of energy).\n【21】 In classical physics energy is considered a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is  a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy-momentum 4-vector).  In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time (= boosts).\n【22】 ## Energy transfer\n【23】 Because energy is strictly conserved and is  locally conserved (wherever it can be defined), it is important to remember that by definition of energy the transfer of energy between the \"system\" and adjacent regions is work.  A familiar example is mechanical work.  In simple cases this is written as:\n【24】 if there are no other energy-transfer processes involved.  Here \\Delta{}E  is the amount of energy transferred, and W  represents the work done on the system.\n【25】 More generally, the energy transfer can be split into two categories:\n【26】 where Q  represents the heat flow into the system.\n【27】 There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. If mass is counted as energy (as in many relativistic problems) then E must contain a term for mass lost or gained. In chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding substances with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then extracted (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). These terms may be added to the above equation, or they can generally be subsumed into a quantity called \"energy addition term E\" which refers to any type of energy carried over the surface of a control volume or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many others can be imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of particles entering a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy, without either being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses).\n【28】 Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected energy terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it.\n【29】 Energy is  transferred from potential energy (E_p) to kinetic energy (E_k) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy can not be created or destroyed, so the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:\n【30】 The equation can then be simplified further since E_p = mgh (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and E_k = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 (half times mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding E_p + E_k = E_{total}.\n【31】 ## Energy and the laws of motion\n【32】 ## The Hamiltonian\n【33】 The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton.  The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems.  These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in\n【34】 nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\n【35】 ## The Lagrangian\n【36】 Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph Louis Lagrange. This is even more fundamental than the Hamiltonian, and can be used to derive the equations of motion. In non-relativistic physics, the Lagrangian is the kinetic energy minus potential energy.\n【37】 Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (like systems with friction).\n【38】 ## Energy and thermodynamics\n【39】 ### Internal energy\n【40】 Internal energy – the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system.  It is related to the molecular structure and the degree of molecular activity and may be viewed as the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules; it comprises the following types of energy:\n【41】 ### The laws of thermodynamics\n【42】 According to the second law of thermodynamics, work can be totally converted into heat, but not vice versa.This is a mathematical consequence of statistical mechanics. The first law of thermodynamics simply asserts that energy is conserved, and that heat is included as a form of energy transfer. A commonly-used corollary of the first law is that for a \"system\" subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g. a cylinder-full of gas), the differential change in energy of the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given by:\n【43】 where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, defined in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy increases and the change dS is positive when the system is heated); and the last term on the right hand side is identified as \"work\" done on the system, where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since compressiong of the system is needed to do work on it, so that the volume change dV is negative when work is done on the system). Although this equation is the standard text-book example of energy conservation in classical thermodynamics, it is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electric, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat, and because it contains a term that depends on temperature.  The most general statement of the first law — i.e. conservation of energy — is valid even in situations in which temperature is undefinable.\n【44】 Energy is sometimes expressed as:\n【45】 which is unsatisfactory  because there cannot exist any thermodynamic state functions W or Q that are meaningful on the right hand side of this equation, except perhaps in trivial cases.\n【46】 ## Equipartition of energy\n【47】 The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternatively kinetic and potential.  At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential.  Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called equipartition principle - total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all these degrees of freedom.\n【48】 This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. This concept is  related to the second law of thermodynamics which basically states that when an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (= is given new available energy states which are the same as existing states), then energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between  \"new\" and \"old\" degrees.\n【49】 ## Oscillators, phonons, and photons\n【50】 In an ensemble (connected collection) of unsynchronized oscillators, the average energy is spread equally between kinetic and potential types.\n【51】 In a solid, thermal energy (often referred to loosely as heat content) can be accurately described by an ensemble of thermal phonons that act as mechanical oscillators.  In this model, thermal energy is equally kinetic and potential.\n【52】 In an ideal gas, the interaction potential between particles is essentially the delta function which stores no energy: thus, all of the thermal energy is kinetic.\n【53】 Because an electric oscillator (LC circuit) is analogous to a mechanical oscillator, its energy must be, on average, equally kinetic and potential.  It is entirely arbitrary whether the magnetic energy is considered kinetic and the electric energy considered potential, or vice versa.  That is, either the inductor is analogous to the mass while the capacitor is analogous to the spring, or vice versa.\n【54】 - By extension of the previous line of thought, in free space the electromagnetic field can be considered an ensemble of oscillators, meaning that radiation energy can be considered equally potential and kinetic.  This model is useful, for example, when the electromagnetic Lagrangian is of primary interest and is interpreted in terms of potential and kinetic energy.\n【55】 - On the other hand, in the key equation m^2 c^4 = E^2 - p^2 c^2, the contribution mc^2 is called the rest energy, and all other contributions to the energy are called kinetic energy.  For a particle that has mass, this implies that the kinetic energy is 0.5 p^2/m at speeds much smaller than c, as can be proved by writing E = mc^2  √(1 + p^2 m^{-2}c^{-2}) and expanding the square root to lowest order.  By this line of reasoning, the energy of a photon is entirely kinetic, because the photon is massless and has no rest energy.  This expression is useful, for example, when the energy-versus-momentum relationship is of primary interest.\n【56】 The two analyses are entirely consistent.  The electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in item 1 are transverse to the direction of motion, while the speed in item 2 is along the direction of motion.  For non-relativistic particles these two notions of potential versus kinetic energy are numerically equal, so the ambiguity is harmless, but not so for relativistic particles.\n【57】 ## Work and virtual work\n【58】 Work is roughly force times distance.  But more precisely, it is\n【59】 This says that the work (W) is equal to the integral (along a certain path) of the force;  for details see the mechanical work article.\n【60】 Work and thus energy is frame dependent.  For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat.  In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball.  But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.\n【61】 ## Quantum mechanics\n【62】 In quantum mechanics energy is defined in terms of the energy operator\n【63】 as a time derivative of the wave function. The  Schrödinger equation equates energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. It thus can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of the wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic wave in vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by the Planck equation E = h\\nu (where h is the Planck's constant and \\nu the frequency). In the case of electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons.\n【64】 ## Relativity\n【65】 When calculating kinetic energy (= work to accelerate a mass from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically - using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics, Einstein discovered unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest mass energy - energy which every mass must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of body:\n【66】 where\n【67】 For example, consider electron-positron annihilation, in which the rest mass of individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of the system of the two particles (its invariant mass) remains (since all energy is associated with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is carried off by photons which individually are massless, but as a system retain their mass. This is a reversible process - the inverse process is called pair creation - in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.\n【68】 In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.\n【69】 It is not uncommon to hear that energy is \"equivalent\" to mass. It would be more accurate to state that every energy has inertia and gravity equivalent, and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia and gravity associated with it.\n【70】 # Measurement\n【71】 There is no absolute measure of energy, because energy is defined as the work that one system does (or can do) on another. Thus, only of the transition of a system from one state into another can be defined and thus measured.\n【72】 ## Methods\n【73】 The methods for the measurement of energy often deploy methods for the measurement of still more fundamental concepts of science, namely mass, distance, radiation, temperature, time, electric charge and electric current.\n【74】 Conventionally the technique most often employed is calorimetry, a thermodynamic technique that relies on the measurement of temperature using a thermometer or of intensity of radiation using a bolometer.\n【75】 ## Units\n【76】 Throughout the history of science, energy has been expressed in several different units such as ergs and calories. At present, the accepted unit of measurement for energy is the SI unit of energy, the joule.\n【77】 # Forms of energy\n【78】 Classical mechanics distinguishes between potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object, and kinetic energy, which is a function of its movement. Both position and movement are relative to a frame of reference, which must be specified: this is often (and originally) an arbitrary fixed point on the surface of the Earth, the terrestrial frame of reference. Some introductory authors attempt to separate all forms of energy in either kinetic or potential: this is not incorrect, but neither is it clear that it is a real simplification, as Feynman points out:\n【79】 These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of length scale.  For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic energy.  Also what is called chemical potential energy (below) is a macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and subatomic scale.  Similar remarks apply to nuclear \"potential\" energy and most other forms of energy.  This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is often the case  but confusion can arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy.\n【80】 ## Potential energy\n【81】 Potential energy, symbols Ep, V or Φ, is defined as the work done against a given force (= work of given force with minus sign) in changing the position of an object with respect to a reference position (often taken to be infinite separation). If F is the force and s is the displacement,\n【82】 with the dot representing the scalar product of the two vectors.\n【83】 The name \"potential\" energy originally signified the idea that the energy could readily be transferred as work—at least in an idealized system (reversible process, see below). This is not completely true for any real system, but is often a reasonable first approximation in classical mechanics.\n【84】 The general equation above can be simplified in a number of common cases, notably when dealing with gravity or with elastic forces.\n【85】 ### Gravitational potential energy\n【86】 The gravitational force near the Earth's surface varies very little with the height, h, and is equal to the mass, m, multiplied by the gravitational acceleration, g = 9.81 m/s². In these cases, the gravitational potential energy is given by\n【87】 A more general expression for the potential energy due to Newtonian gravitation between two bodies of masses m1 and m2, useful in astronomy, is\n【88】 where r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant,\n【89】 6.6742×10−11 m³kg−1s−2. In this case, the reference point is the infinite separation of the two bodies.\n【90】 ### Elastic potential energy\n【91】 Elastic potential energy is defined as a work needed to compress (or expand) a spring.\n【92】 The force, F, in a spring or any other system which obeys Hooke's law is proportional to the extension or compression, x,\n【93】 where k is the force constant of the particular spring (or system). In this case, the calculated work becomes\n【94】 Hooke's law is a good approximation for behaviour of chemical bonds under normal conditions, i.e. when they are not being broken or formed.\n【95】 ## Kinetic energy\n【96】 Kinetic energy, symbols Ek, T or K, is the work required to accelerate an object to a given speed. Indeed, calculating this work one easily obtains the following:\n【97】 At speeds approaching the speed of light, c, this work must be calculated using Lorentz transformations, which results in the following:\n【98】 This equation reduces to the one above it, at small (compared to c) speed. A mathematical by-product of this work (which is immediately seen in the last equation) is that even at rest a mass has the amount of energy equal to:\n【99】 This energy is thus called rest mass energy.\n【100】 ## Thermal energy\n【101】 The general definition of thermal energy, symbols q or Q, is  problematic. A practical definition for small transfers of heat is\n【102】 where Cv is the heat capacity of the system. This definition will fail if the system undergoes a phase transition—e.g. if ice is melting to water—as in these cases the system can absorb heat without increasing its temperature. In more complex systems, it is preferable to use the concept of internal energy rather than that of thermal energy  Chemical energy below).\n【103】 Despite the theoretical problems, the above definition is useful in the experimental measurement of energy changes. In a wide variety of situations, it is possible to use the energy released by a system to raise the temperature of another object, e.g. a bath of water. It is  possible to measure the amount of electric energy required to raise the temperature of the object by the same amount. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 °C (approximately 4.1855 J, although the definition later changed), and the British thermal unit was defined as the energy required to heat one gallon (UK) of water by 1 °F (later fixed as 1055.06 J).\n【104】 ## Electric energy\n【105】 The electric potential energy of given configuration of charges is defined as the work which must be done against the Coulomb force to rearrange charges from infinite separation to this configuration (or the work done by the Coulomb force separating the charges from this configuration to infinity). For two point-like charges Q1 and Q2 at a distance r this work, and hence electric potential energy is equal to:\n【106】 where ε0 is the electric constant of a vacuum, 107/4πc0² or 8.854188…×10−12 F/m. If the charge is accumulated in a capacitor (of capacitance C), the reference configuration is usually selected not to be infinite separation of charges, but vice versa - charges at an extremely close proximity to each other (so there is zero net charge on each plate of a capacitor). In this case the work and thus the electric potential energy becomes\n【107】 If an electric current passes through a resistor, electric energy is converted to heat; if the current passes through an electric appliance, some of the electric energy will be converted into other forms of energy (although some will always be lost as heat). The amount of electric energy due to an electric current can be expressed in a number of different ways:\n【108】 where U is the electric potential difference (in volts), Q is the charge (in coulombs), I is the current (in amperes), t is the time for which the current flows (in seconds), P is the power (in watts) and R is the electric resistance (in ohms). The last of these expressions is important in the practical measurement of energy, as potential difference, resistance and time can all be measured with considerable accuracy.\n【109】 ### Magnetic energy\n【110】 There is no fundamental difference between magnetic energy and electric energy: the two phenomena are related by Maxwell's equations. The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B is defined as the work  of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:\n【111】 while the energy stored in a inductor (of inductance L) when current I is passing via it is\n【112】 This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage.\n【113】 ### Electromagnetic fields\n【114】 Calculating work needed to create an electric or magnetic field in unit volume (say, in a capacitor or an inductor) results in the electric and magnetic fields energy densities:\n【115】 and\n【116】 in SI units.\n【117】 Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, visible light or gamma rays, represents a flow of electromagnetic energy. Applying the above expressions to magnetic and electric components of electromagnetic field both the volumetric density and the flow of energy in e/m field can be calculated.   The resulting Poynting vector, which is expressed as\n【118】 in SI units, gives the density of the flow of energy and its direction.\n【119】 The energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized (has discrete energy levels). The spacing between these levels is equal to\n【120】 where h is the Planck constant, 6.6260693×10−34 Js, and ν is the frequency of the radiation.  This quantity of electromagnetic energy is usually called a photon. The photons which make up visible light have energies of 270–520 yJ, equivalent to 160–310 kJ/mol, the strength of weaker chemical bonds.\n【121】 ## Chemical energy\n【122】 Chemical energy is the energy due to associations of atoms in molecules and various other kinds of aggregrates of matter. It may be defined as a work done by electric forces during re-arrangement of electric charges, electrons and protons, in the process of aggregration.  If the chemical energy of a system decreases during a chemical reaction, it is transferred to the surroundings in some form of energy (often heat); on the other hand if the chemical energy of a system increases as a result of a chemical reaction - it is by converting another form of energy from the surroundings. For example,\n【123】 It is common to quote the changes in chemical energy for one mole of the substance in question: typical values for the change in molar chemical energy during a chemical reaction range from tens to hundreds of kJ/mol.\n【124】 The chemical energy as defined above is  referred to by chemists as the internal energy, U: technically, this is measured by keeping the volume of the system constant. However, most practical chemistry is performed at constant pressure and, if the volume changes during the reaction (e.g. a gas is given off), a correction must be applied to take account of the work done by or on the atmosphere to obtain the enthalpy, H:\n【125】 A second correction, for the change in entropy, S, must  be performed to determine whether a chemical reaction will take place or not, giving the Gibbs free energy, G:\n【126】 These corrections are sometimes negligible, but often not (especially in reactions involving gases).\n【127】 Since the industrial revolution, the burning of coal, oil, natural gas or products derived from them has been a socially significant transformation of chemical energy into other forms of energy. the energy \"consumption\" (one should really speak of \"energy transformation\") of a society or country is often quoted in reference to the average energy released by the combustion of these fossil fuels:\n【128】 On the same basis, a tank-full of gasoline (45 litres, 12 gallons) is equivalent to about 1.6 GJ of chemical energy. Another chemically-based unit of measurement for energy is the \"tonne of TNT\", taken as 4.184 GJ. Hence, burning a tonne of oil releases about ten times as much energy as the explosion of one tonne of TNT: fortunately, the energy is usually released in a slower, more controlled manner.\n【129】 Simple examples of chemical energy are batteries and food. When you eat the food is digested and turned into chemical energy which can be transformed to kinetic energy.\n【130】 ## Nuclear energy\n【131】 Nuclear potential energy, along with electric potential energy, provides the energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. The result of both these processes are nuclei in which strong nuclear forces bind nuclear particles more strongly and closely. Weak nuclear forces (different from strong forces) provide the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. The energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the relativistic change in mass (after the energy has been removed) can be as much as several parts per thousand.\n【132】 Nuclear particles (nucleons) like protons and neutrons are not destroyed (law of conservation of baryon number) in fission and fusion processes. A few lighter particles may be created or destroyed (example: beta minus and beta plus decay, or electron capture decay), but these minor processes are not important to the immediate energy release in fission and fusion. Rather, fission and fusion release energy when collections of baryons become more tightly bound, and it is the energy associated with a fraction of the mass of the nucleons (but not the whole particles) which appears as the heat and electromagnetic radiation generated by nuclear reactions. This heat and radiation retains the \"missing\" mass, but the mass is missing only because it escapes in the form of heat and light, which retain the mass and conduct it out of the system where it is not measured. The energy from the Sun,  called solar energy, is an example of this form of energy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4 million metric tons of solar matter per second into light, which is radiated into space, but during this process, the number of total protons and neutrons in the sun does not change. In this system, the light itself retains the inertial equivalent of this mass, and indeed the mass itself (as a system), which represents 4 million tons per second of electromagnetic radiation, moving into space. Each of the helium nuclei which are formed in the process are less massive than the four protons from they were formed, but (to a good approximation), no particles or atoms are destroyed in the process of turning the sun's nuclear potential energy into light.\n【133】 ## Surface energy\n【134】 If there is any kind of tension in a surface, such as a stretched sheet of rubber or material interfaces, it is possible to define surface energy. In particular, any meeting of dissimilar materials that don't mix will result in some kind of surface tension, if there is freedom for the surfaces to move then, as seen in capillary surfaces for example, the minimum energy will as usual be sought.\n【135】 A minimal surface, for example, represents the smallest possible energy that a surface can have if its energy is proportional to the area of the surface. For this reason, (open) soap films of small size are minimal surfaces (small size reduces gravity effects, and openness prevents pressure from building up. Note that a bubble is a minimum energy surface but not a minimal surface by definition).\n【136】 # Transformations of energy\n【137】 One form of energy can often be readily transformed into another with the help of a device- for instance, a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy; a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction, the conversion of energy between these processes is perfect, and the pendulum will continue swinging forever.\n【138】 Energy can be converted into matter and vice versa.  The mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc², derived independently by Albert Einstein and Henri Poincaré, quantifies the relationship between mass and rest energy.  Since c^2 is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of mass to other forms of energy can liberate tremendous amounts of energy, as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.  Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (particles) are found in high energy nuclear physics.\n【139】 In nature, transformations of energy can be fundamentally classed into two kinds: those that are thermodynamically reversible, and those that are thermodynamically irreversible. A reversible process in thermodynamics is one in which no energy is dissipated into empty quantum states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, however, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible exitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in a crystal).\n【140】 As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy, grows less and less.\n【141】 # Law of conservation of energy\n【142】 Energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can neither be created (produced) nor destroyed itself. It can only be transformed.\n【143】 Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) are  subject to strict local conservation laws, as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is  a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.  Conservation of energy is the mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time (that is, the indistinguishability of time intervals taken at different time) - see Noether's theorem.\n【144】 According to energy conservation law the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system.\n【145】 This law is a fundamental principle of physics. It follows from the translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable.\n【146】 Because energy is quantity which is canonical conjugate to time, it is impossible to define exact amount of energy during any definite time interval - making it impossible to apply the law of conservation of energy.  This must not be considered a \"violation\" of the law.  We know the law still holds, because a succession of short time periods does not accumulate any violation of conservation of energy.\n【147】 In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator.  On\n【148】 any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by\n【149】 which is similar in form to the uncertainty principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).\n【150】 In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which with real particles is responsible for creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions). Virtual photons (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are  responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb law), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena.\n【151】 # Energy and life\n【152】 Any living organism relies on an external source of energy—radiation from the Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the case of animals—to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000 Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C6H12O and stearin (C57H110O are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria\n【153】 and some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATP\n【154】 The rest of the chemical energy in the carbohydrate or fat is converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of \"energy currency\", and some of the chemical energy it contains when split and reacted with water, is used for other metabolism (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:\n【155】 It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. However, in growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"the surroundings\"). Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat.\n", "seq_id": 32854, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#82#82#接上一行", "type3": "无关文本#143#143#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#147#147# On内容与文本无关", "type4": "语义不完整#96#98#没表述完整\n语义不完整#110#112#没表述完整\n语义不完整#114#115#没表述完整\n语义不完整#117#117#没表述完整\n语义不完整#119#119#没表述完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:12:40"}

In such a design, one might be interested in whether depressive symptoms (measured, for example, by a Beck Depression Inventory score) decreased to a greater extent for those using the new drug compared to the old drug. Further, one might be interested in whether any side effects (e.g., hypersomnia, decreased sex drive, and dry mouth) were observed. In such a case, two families would likely be identified:  effect of drug on depressive symptoms,  occurrence of any side effects.\n【10】 Thus, one would assign an acceptable Type I error rate, alpha, (usually . to each family and control for family-wise error using appropriate multiple comparison procedures. In the case of the first family, effect of antidepressant on depressive symptoms, pairwise comparisons among groups (here, there would be three possible comparisons) would be jointly controlled using techniques such as Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) comparison procedure or a Bonferroni correction. In terms of the side effect profile, one would likely be interested in controlling for Type I error in terms of all side effects considered jointly so that decisions about the side effect profile would not be erroneously inflated by allowing each side effect and each pairwise comparison among groups to receive its own uncorrected alpha. By the Bonferroni inequality, allowing each side effect and comparison its own alpha would result in a Type I error of .05 - 3 side effects - 3 pairwise comparisons per side effect = 0.45 (i.e., 45% chance of making a Type I error). Thus, a more appropriate control for side effect family-wise error might divide alpha by three (.05/3 = . and allocate .0167 to each side effect multiple comparison procedure. In the case of Tukey's HSD (a strong control multiple comparison procedure), one would determine the critical value of Q, the studentized range statistic, based on the alpha of .0167.\n", "seq_id": 15666, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:24:30"}

People who play close contact sports such as rugby, American football and wrestling are  susceptible, regardless of age. The name derives from the Latin impetere (\"assail\"). It is  known as school sores. Skin is normally colonized with a large number of pathogens. When the pathogens increase in number on the skin or when there is a break in the continuity ofthe skin, they can lead to an infection.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 In 1880, Alexander Ogston for the first time wrote about the involvement of Staphylococci in skin infections.In 1863, R. W. Dunn of Porrigo described lesions of impetigo as dirty, flat, irregular spots that are straw coloured. The first epidemic in the nurseries was reported in 1989.\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Impetigo can be classified in various ways. It can be classified as bullous, non-bullous and ecthyma. It can  be classified as primary or secondary to a disease or process. Another classification pattern is with respect to the involved pathogen as staphylococcal or streptococcal impetigo. Non-bullous impetigo  known as \"impetigo contagiosa\" is caused by both Staphylococci and Streptococci and is estimated to make almost 70% of its cases.\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 Impetigo is spread by direct lesion contact. The incubation period is 1–3 days and 4-10 days for for Streptococci and Staphylococci respectively. Bullous impetigo is caused by exfoliative toxins which are released by Stapphylococcus aureus. The toxins are of two types, A and B, and lead to the production of bullae in the superficial layer of epidermis.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 Impetigo is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus.  Streptococci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes) have been associated with the non-bullous form of impetigo and ecthyma.Streptococci can either infect individually or co-infect with Staphylococcus aureus. Non-bullous impetigo makes 70% of all the caess of impetigo.\n【11】 # Differentiating Impetigo from other Diseases\n【12】 Impetigo must be differentiated from other diseases that cause pustules surrounded by erythematous skin, including chickenpox, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, among others. It should be differentiated from scabies, contact dermatitis, lupus (discoid type), herpes simplex, burns, necrotizing faciitis.\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 In 2010, 140 million people suffered from impetigo. Impetigo is more common among children. Impetigo is more prevalent in tropical and pacific countries.\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 Impetigo is often associated with insect bites, cuts, and other forms of trauma to the skin. Humidity, obesity, corticosteroid use, chemotherapy, dysglobulinemias, leukemias and malnutrition are some other risk factors for impetigo. Handwashing decreseas the incidence of impetigo by 34%.\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has not issued any guidelines for the screening of impetigo.\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【20】 If left untreated, most cases of non-bullous impetigo resolve within 1-2 weeks. The complications of impetigo include poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever.\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 # History and Symptoms\n【23】 PImptigo has a conatgious course. People who suffer from cold sores have shown higher chances of suffering from impetigo. Patients with impetigo usualy have a history of recurrent lesions, immunodeficiency and trauma or abrasions. Symptoms may vary from vesicles to bullae that can be seen localized in early disease or spread to trunk and extremities if not taken care of. Fever and fatigue are important symtoms associated with seeking medical attention.\n【24】 Patients may present with one or more pimple-like lesions surrounded by reddened skin. Lesions fill with pus, then break down over 4–6 days and form a thick crust. Impetigo is often associated with insect bites, cuts, and other forms of trauma to the skin. Itching is common.\n【25】 # Physical Examination\n【26】 The diagnosis of impetigo is primarily clinical. A thorough physical examination plays an important role in the diagnosis of impetigo along with a detailed history taking.Bullae, papules, pustules or ulcers may be visible depicting various types of impetigo.\n【27】 # Laboratory Findings\n【28】 Impetigo is primarily diagnosed clinically. Some laboratory tests can  be used to confirm the involved pathogen and to focus the treatment on that pathogen in particular. These include gram stain and culture and senstivity.\n【29】 # Xray\n【30】 Xrays do not contribute in the diagnosis of impetigo.\n【31】 # CT Scan\n【32】 CT scan does not contribute in the diagnosis of impetigo.\n【33】 # MRI\n【34】 MRI does not contribute in the diagnosis of impetigo.\n【35】 # Ultrasound\n【36】 Ultrasound does not contribute in the diagnosis of impetigo.\n【37】 # Other Imaging Findings\n【38】 Other imaging findings do not contribute in the diagnosis of impetigo.\n【39】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n【40】 Immunodeficiency can be evaluated in case of recurrence of impetigo. Other aspects may involve a detailed review of conditions like malnutrition, leukemia and diabetes.\n【41】 # Treatment\n【42】 The treatment of impetigo is primarily medical.\n【43】 # Medical Therapy\n【44】 The mainstay of therapy for impetigo is antimicrobial therapy. Empiric therapy for mild disease includes either Mupirocin or Retapamulin applied topically.  Empiric therapy for numerous lesions or poststreptococcoal glomerulonephritis includes either Dicloxacillin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, or Cephalexin.  Penicillin is the drug of choice for impetigo caused by Streptococcus.  Patients with impetigo caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are treated with either Doxycycline, Clindamycin, or Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim. Non-bullous impetigo is self resolving and usually takes 1-2 weeks.Topical or oral antibiotics are usually prescribed.\n【45】 # Surgery\n【46】 Medical therapy is the primary mode of treatment for impetigo. Surgery is not usually required. Biopsy may sometimes be required if there is recurrence of lesions and the diagnosis of impetigo is not confimed.\n【47】 # Primary Prevention\n【48】 Primary prevention of impetigo involves various aspect of ensuring hygiene including avoiding prolonged exposures to dirty environments , handwashing and regular bathing. Handwashing alone can decrease the incidence of impetigo by 34%.\n【49】 # Secondary Prevention\n【50】 The measure for secondary prevention of impetigo include avoidance of scratching, keeping the lesions covered, nails must be cut to avoid spread and keepig towel separate is  recommended.\n", "seq_id": 19865, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-18 00:19:32"}

This chapter introduces the WHO approach to healthy housing, outlines the key risks to health associated with the housing environment, and assesses the burden of disease associated with housing. Subsequently, the objectives, rational, target audience, scope, and co-benefits of the HHGL are introduced, as well as the relationship between the social determinants of health, housing and health.\n【2】 - 1 Housing and health\n【3】 # WHO approach to healthy housing\n【4】 Healthy housing is shelter that supports a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Healthy housing provides a feeling of home, including a sense of belonging, security and privacy. Healthy housing  refers to the physical structure of the dwelling, and the extent to which it enables physical health, including by being structurally sound, by providing shelter from the elements and from excess moisture, and by facilitating comfortable temperatures, adequate sanitation and illumination, sufficient space, safe fuel or connection to electricity, and protection from pollutants, injury hazards, mould and pests. Whether housing is healthy  depends on factors outside its walls. It depends on the local community, which enables social interactions that support health and well-being. Finally, healthy housing relies on the immediate housing environment, and the extent to which this provides access to services, green space, and active and public transport options, as well as protection from waste, pollution and the effects of disaster, whether natural or man-made .\n【5】 # Key health risks related to housing\n【6】 Exposures and health risks in the home environment are critically important because of the large amount of time people spend there. In high-income countries, around 70% of people's time is spent inside their home . In some places, including where unemployment levels are higher, and where more people are employed in home-based industries, this percentage is even higher . Children, the elderly, and those with a disability or chronic illness are likely to spend most of their time at home, and are therefore more exposed to health risks associated with housing . Children are  at increased risk of the harms from some of the toxins that are present in some housing, such as those in lead paint .\n【7】 Housing will become increasingly important to health due to demographic and climate changes. The number of people aged over 60 years of age, who spend a larger proportion of their time at home, will double by 2050 . The changing weather patterns associated with climate change  underline the importance of housing providing protection from cold, heat and extreme weather events .\n【8】 Poor housing can expose people to several health risks. For example, structurally deficient housing, due to poor construction or maintenance, can increase the likelihood that people slip or fall, increasing the risk of injury.\n【9】 Poor accessibility to homes may expose their disabled and elderly residents to the risk of injury, stress and isolation. Housing that is insecure, sometimes due to affordability issues or weak security of tenure, is stressful. Housing that is difficult or expensive to heat can contribute to poor respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes, while high indoor temperatures can increase cardiovascular mortality. Indoor air pollution harms respiratory health and may trigger allergic and irritant reactions, such as asthma. Crowded housing increases the risk of exposure to infectious disease and stress. Inadequate water supply and sanitation facilities affect food safety and personal hygiene.\n【10】 Urban design that discourages physical activity contributes to obesity and related conditions, such as diabetes, and poor mental and cardiovascular health. Unsafe building materials or building practices, or building homes in unsafe locations, can expose people to a range of risks, such as injury due to building collapse.\n【11】 Housing in slums (the preferred term of UN-Habitat) and informal housing pose particular risks to health. Currently, around 1 billion people live in slum conditions today , which often develop due to exclusion from planning processes. According to UN-Habitat, a \"slum household\" is a group of individuals under the same roof, in an urban area, lacking one or more of the following: durable housing (housing which fails to provide shelter from the elements); sufficient living space; security of tenure; sanitation and infrastructure; and access to improved (uncontaminated) water sources.\n【12】 Slum dwellers are therefore exposed to many of the risks associated with housing, such as structurally defective dwellings, inadequate housing facilities and overcrowding, but  face particular health risks from poor sanitation and unsafe electric connections, toxic building materials, unvented cooking facilities, and unsafe infrastructure, including roads. In addition, such settlements are sometimes in locations that are more likely to expose occupants to hazards such as landslides, floods and industrial pollution. In relation to well-being, the lack of legal title to homes is stressful and can expose slum dwellers to the risk of forced eviction .\n【13】 Slums and informal settlements often house migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. More people are on the move now than ever before.\n【14】 There are an estimated 1 billion migrants in the world today: 250 million international migrants, and 763 million internal migrants. This number includes 65 million people, who have been forcibly displaced and require urgent housing solutions .\n【15】 # Prevalence of poor housing conditions\n【16】 Large numbers of people live in poor housing conditions. For example, 6% of households in Latin America and the Caribbean (compared with 0.4% in the European Union) have more than three people per room . Some 9% of the global population has no access to an improved (uncontaminated) drinkingwater source. Nearly half of all people using poor quality or contaminated drinking-water sources live in sub-Saharan Africa, while one fifth live in South Asia . In addition, 41% of the world's population cook and heat their housing using open fires and simple stoves that burn solid fuels. These result in polluted indoor air  and inadequate ventilation.\n【17】 Globally, many houses have structural defects. For example, 15% of the European population live in housing with a leaking roof, or damp walls, floors or foundations, or rot in window frames, floors and other structural elements . Almost 20% report that their housing did not protect them against excessive heat during summer, while 13% report that their housing was not comfortably warm during winter . In the United Kingdom, 72% of adults with mobility problems reported that the entry to their housing was not properly accessible . In the United States of America, 5.2% of the housing stock is classified as inadequate, having either severe or moderate physical problems such as deficiencies in heating, plumbing or upkeep .\n【18】 # Burden of disease associated with housing\n【19】 Health conditions related to housing present an important health burden.\n【20】 Some of this is attributable to poor access to water and poor indoor environmental quality. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) were responsible for 829 000 deaths from diarrhoeal disease worldwide in 2016. This constitutes 1.9% of the global burden of disease measured as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) . In 2016, 3.8 million deaths globally were attributable to household air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking, almost all of which occurred in low-and middle-income countries . About 15% of new childhood asthma in Europe can be attributed to indoor dampness, representing over 69 000 potentially avoidable DALYs and 103 potentially avoidable deaths every year .\n【21】 Housing  contributes to the burden of disease through exposing people to dangerous substances or hazards, or to infectious diseases. For example, almost 110 000 people die every year in Europe as a result of injuries at home or during leisure activities, and a further 32 million require hospital admission because of such injuries . In Europe, it has been estimated that 7500 deaths and 200 000 DALYs are attributable to lack of window guards and smoke detectors . Approximately 10% of hospital admissions per year in New Zealand are attributable to household crowding . In 2012, India recorded over 2600 deaths and 850 of various injuries resulting from the collapse of over 2700 buildings . In Kyrgyzstan, household crowding causes 18.13 deaths per 100 000 from tuberculosis (TB) per year . Exposure to lead is estimated to have caused 853 000 deaths in 2013 .\n【22】 While everyone can be exposed to the risks associated with unhealthy housing, people with low incomes and vulnerable groups are more likely to live in unsuitable or insecure housing, or to be denied housing altogether .\n【23】 Inequalities associated with housing are discussed later in this chapter.\n【24】 # WHO Housing and health guidelines\n【25】 # Objectives and rationale for developing the WHO Housing and health guidelines\n【26】 The impact of housing on health and the prevalence of poor housing conditions around the world, as presented in section 1.1, justify the need for globally acceptable and practical guidelines that will ensure healthy housing and human safety. The underlying principle of such guidelines is for housing to give adequate protection from all potential hazards prevailing in the local environment. This principle should apply to both the existing housing stock and newly constructed dwellings. Although a number of housing and health regulatory frameworks and guidelines exist, they are not comprehensively coordinated to address all aspects of housing, human health and safety. For instance, WHO has guidelines for indoor air quality or water and sanitation but there is a lack of comprehensive, international housing and health guidelines highlighting that these can be a fundamental way of improving population health . While improving housing may not be the top policy priority in all countries, reliable global guidance for shaping current and future policy is the first step to protect people living in a range of climatic conditions from unhealthy housing. This is a critical public health priority. The improvements recommended by these guidelines relate to a large array of housing aspects, including vital infrastructure, the physical dwelling, the use of the dwelling, and the location of the dwelling. They must be viewed alongside each other so that policy-makers can make the most of co-benefits and synergies, while avoiding trade-offs . Large benefits in cost-effectiveness would arise from addressing the health risks associated with housing simultaneously and this approach is in line with WHO's intersectoral work to create health-promoting environments .\n【27】 These HHGL add to existing WHO guidelines by providing evidence-based recommendations on healthy housing conditions and interventions that are not covered by the other guidelines, and by summarizing those relevant to housing and health. As sectoral guidelines, they represent a proactive step forward, highlighting the need to address the health risks associated with housing through a systems approach. By their nature, land use and building regulations act to address multiple risks, including structures and heating systems, as well as hazard avoidance. These HHGL, by providing access to the science on minimizing multiple health risks associated with housing, will be an important resource for Member States.\n【28】 Implementing the HHGL will support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all age groups and SDG 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable . The HHGL will  be influential for ensuring availability of sanitation for all at household level (SDG , meeting targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency (SDG\n【29】 and taking action to mitigate climate change (SDG  . The importance of the sectoral approach has been recently emphasized in the New Urban Agenda for sustainable urban development established at Habitat III .\n【30】 The HHGL contribute towards ensuring Member States meet their obligations regarding the human right to adequate housing. This right to adequate housing is recognized in international human rights laws as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted in  and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (adopted in . For housing to be adequate, the following seven criteria must be met: security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location; and cultural adequacy . Thus, the HHGL will inform regulations that aim to address and fulfil the above criteria of adequate housing. While the HHGL provide global recommendations, their implementation and prioritization will vary by local context and will require national and local adaptation.\n【31】 # Target audience\n【32】 The main target audience for the guidelines is policy-makers who are responsible for housing-related policies and regulations, enforcement measures, and initiating intersectoral collaborations that seek to support healthy housing from a government perspective.\n【33】 The guidelines are  of direct relevance to the daily work of implementing actors such as government agencies, architects, builders, housing providers, developers, engineers, urban planners, industry regulators, financial institutions, as well as social services, community groups, and public health professionals. These stakeholders are ultimately required to ensure that housing is built, maintained, renovated, used and demolished in ways that support health.\n【34】 As already noted, \"healthy housing\" is associated with several factors, inside and outside the home. The HHGL do not address all possible risk factors related to housing but focus on priority areas that have not yet been addressed by existing WHO guidelines and where robust evidence is available. These were identified by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) established for this work  Chapter .\n【35】 The priority areas addressed by the HHGL are as follows:\n【36】 - inadequate living space (crowding) (Chapter\n【37】 - low indoor temperatures (Chapter\n【38】 - high indoor temperatures (Chapter\n【39】 - injury hazards in the home (Chapter\n【40】 - accessibility of housing for people with functional impairments (Chapter .\n【41】 In addition to the above, existing WHO guidelines and recommendations related to housing are identified and summarized in Chapter 8 to cover the following issues:\n【42】 - water quality (section 8.\n【43】 - air quality (section 8.\n【44】 - tobacco smoke (section 8.\n【45】 - noise (section 8.\n【46】 - asbestos (section 8.\n【47】 - lead (section 8.\n【48】 - radon (section 8..\n【49】 Guidance on other aspects of housing and buildings that relate to healthincluding pests, food safety and ventilation -are listed in section 8.8. Despite the range of issues covered, the list of relevant elements is not exhaustive.\n【50】 For instance, there are still a number of housing risk factors (such as lighting, height of ceilings and buildings, electric security, housing surroundings and fuel poverty) that have not been covered in the HHGL at this time. WHO is planning to continue investigating and working on other housing-related risk factors to health and to provide future guidance. At the same time, the HHGL do not distinguish between permanent housing and housing that is intended to be temporary, such as emergency shelter arrangements. However, the GDG recognizes that implementing the HHGL is likely to be more challenging in informal and emergency housing and will require different priorities, depending on the context. General implementation considerations and WHO's role in supporting these are discussed in Chapter 9. Important supplementary guidance relevant to emergency shelter arrangements are further provided by the Sphere Project . Homelessness, which is the most extreme denial of the right to adequate housing, is not discussed as part of the HHGL .\n【51】 Co-benefits arise from addressing the key health risks associated with housing. In many cases, a dwelling poses multiple risks to healthy housing.\n【52】 For example, a house may have poor indoor air quality, be cold, and have multiple injury hazards. Housing risks should therefore be viewed holistically and as components of an inter-related system in order to take advantages of the co-benefits presented by different interventions. For example, correcting structural defects reduces the risk of injury, improves thermal comfort, and reduces exposure to outdoor pollutants.\n【53】 Housing interventions can  have indirect co-benefits for health. Improving thermal insulation, weatherization and ventilation, and installing energyefficient heating (Chapters 4 and  can improve indoor temperatures that support health, while  lowering expenditure on energy .\n【54】 Improving housing conditions  supports other positive social outcomes.\n【55】 As discussed in Chapter 3, reducing crowding supports good health outcomes, but  contributes to improved educational outcomes, as children are able to study more effectively . Improving thermal comfort through installing insulation and heating reduces days off school and work . Improving housing can  create jobs and stimulate investment . Therefore, addressing health risks associated with housing is likely to particularly benefit low-income and vulnerable groups, as these groups are more likely to live in inadequate housing.\n【56】 In recent years, some countries have instituted new \"green\" standards for construction practices. These standards are aimed at addressing the design, location, and site of housing; promote water conservation and energy efficiency; encourage the use of building materials beneficial to the environment; and promote healthy living conditions . Some green housing elements that are typically included in such standards are associated with health outcomes, including: energy efficient heating; improved ventilation; building materials free from formaldehyde, lead and asbestos; sound insulation; and no carpets in kitchens and bathrooms .\n【57】 The HHGL aim to ensure that occupants of green housing  enjoy health benefits .\n【58】 # Social determinants, housing and health\n【59】 Choices of housing types, quality, size and location are shaped by a number of economic, social and demographic factors. These factors affect the features that the house will provide to its occupants (e.g. durability, building materials, accessibility etc.) and whether they can afford the cost of operating and maintaining it. The cost of maintaining and operating a house is of importance to human health and safety and includes: the purchase of safe drinkingwater and of electricity or other fuel for heating the home . Transport infrastructure can  be considered as an operational aspect of housing affordability, because it influences how much people need to pay to travel between their homes and work and other places. 3 Globally, across low-, middle-and high-income countries, low-income earners are more likely to live in housing that exposes them to health risks. For example, in Cambodia, toilet facilities are only available to 29% of households in the lowest income quintile, compared with 79% of households in the highest income quintile .\n【60】 This inequality in housing conditions goes beyond whether people are rich or poor. In some countries certain groups, including indigenous people, minority populations, single parent families, disabled people and women, are more likely to live in unsuitable housing .\n【61】 Poor health outcomes in turn can contribute to poor economic outcomes.\n【62】 Poor health can be expensive, because of the costs of treating illnesses. In addition, poor health can affect people's capacity to earn or save money .\n【63】 This creates a cycle between poor health and poor household, local and national economic outcomes. At the same time, housing that is expensive relative to income can affect health, in particular for people on low incomes.\n【64】 High housing costs can compel people to cut back on other essentials that are connected to health, including food, energy and health care . Difficulty with paying rent and mortgage costs exposes people to risks of eviction and foreclosure , and increases the likelihood that people have to move often .\n【65】 Interventions that create healthy homes can help to break this cycle by improving health and broader social and economic outcomes, yielding important benefits for decades into the future. These housing-related interventions need to be complemented by policy interventions relating to education, employment, transport, child care, health systems, taxation, wages, benefit levels and job security. Each of these factors can affect incomes and thus affect people's ability to pay for housing that keeps them healthy .\n【66】 Providing affordable housing can help people to afford housing that fits their needs while improving their health .\n【67】 # Guideline development process\n【68】 #   Guideline development process\n【69】 - 1 Contributors to the guidelines\n【70】 # WHO Steering Group\n【71】 The WHO Steering Group (SG) has been involved in all stages of planning the HHGL, review of evidence and all rounds of consultation on revisions following peer review. Their inputs were provided through face-to-face meetings and email.\n【72】 # Guideline Development Group\n【73】 The GDG was made up of people with content expertise in all areas covered by the HHGL, including relevant experience from low-and middle-income countries and expertise in evidence-based guideline development  Acknowledgements for names and affiliations). GDG selection  took into consideration the need to ensure gender balance and regional diversity. The members of the GDG, under the guidance of the guideline methodologist, worked together to define key questions, priorities and systematic review methods, served as authors of HHGL chapters (including drafting and determining the strength of the recommendations), and responded to external peer review comments. Specified GDG members served as chair, co-chair and rapporteurs.\n【74】 # External Review Group\n【75】 External reviewers were drawn from subject experts, implementing agencies and partners working on various aspects of policy to improve health outcomes related to housing to form the External Review Group (ERG)\n【76】 # Systematic review\n【77】 Systematic reviews of the evidence on the effects of the prioritized interventions and exposures related to crowding, indoor temperature, accessibility and injury hazards were commissioned  Acknowledgements for names and affiliations).\n【78】 # Identification of priority questions and critical outcomes\n【79】 Following discussions with the GDG at the first meeting in Washington (DC) on 9-11 April 2013, a set of priority topics was identified for these guidelines.\n【80】 This took account of areas of healthy housing that have been covered in other, recent WHO guidelines in order to avoid unnecessary duplication. The priority topics demonstrated the need for a series of distinct systematic reviews of the effects of the relevant interventions or exposures: crowding, low indoor temperatures, insulation, high indoor temperatures, injury hazards, and housing accessibility. It was recognized that the breadth of the topics covered by these systematic reviews meant that different approaches would be needed, and that there would be relatively little, if any, overlap in their included studies and their conduct (e.g. search strategies). Therefore, a mixture of research groups was engaged to form the systematic review teams.\n【81】 The questions to be addressed by each review were agreed by the WHO Secretariat, the SG and the GDG. These were converted into a PICO or PECO format to show the population, intervention (or exposure), comparator and outcome as the four elements to be considered in the systematic review of the evidence . In order to focus the reviews, and their subsequent recommendations, the GDG prioritized the outcomes to be assessed. They ranked the relative importance of a series of health outcomes on a scale from 1 (not important for these guidelines) to 9 (critical) based on their own expert knowledge. The mean scores were calculated and the highest ranked outcomes for each review were included in its PICO or PECO.\n【82】 # Evidence identification and retrieval\n【83】 Having agreed on the scope and eligibility criteria for each of the six systematic reviews, the systematic review teams, in consultation with the WHO Secretariat and guideline methodologist, used dedicated search strategies to systematically provide evidence on the effects of the prioritized interventions or exposures. The searches were conducted in 2015 and updated in 2018. GDG members and experts from the specific areas for each review were asked to suggest potentially eligible studies to help inform the design and implementation of the searches. Evidence on the effects of interventions (e.g. insulation and safety devices) stemmed mainly from randomized trials and non-randomized comparative studies (as necessary), while observational designs, such as case-control or cohort studies, were the most relevant designs for studies investigating the effects of exposures (e.g. crowding and heat).\n【84】 The WHO Secretariat, designated members of the GDG and the methodologist worked together to develop the methods used for each review. The format for the reports of the systematic reviews was agreed with the WHO Secretariat, drawing on experience from previous systematic reviews for WHO guidelines.\n【85】 This included the inclusion of key elements for each review, such as the PICO or PECO used to define the scope of the review, the search strategy, methods, a table showing the characteristics of each included study and their quality, and an assessment of the overall quality of the evidence for the effects on each prioritized outcome using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence profile tables  the reviews for examples). A timeline was developed for the submission of the draft and final versions of the reviews to allow time for discussion with, and feedback from, the WHO Secretariat and members of the GDG.\n【86】 Given the substantial differences in topic areas for the reviews, search strategies specific to each review were developed, tested and implemented by the systematic review teams. Details of these searches, including the number of retrieved records and the flow of these through the review process, are provided in the report for each systematic review.\n【87】 # Quality assessment and grading of the evidence\n【88】 Each systematic review team used appropriate instruments to assess the quality and risk of bias of each study included in their review. This allowed a tailored approach to the quality assessment of the eligible studies for each review. It  allowed an overall assessment of the quality and relevance of the body of evidence for each review. Details of the methods used and the assessments are provided in the report of each review. The evidence gathered for the effects of an intervention or exposure on the prioritized health outcomes was assessed using the GRADE approach. This led to the categorization of the quality of evidence for each outcome as \"high\", \"moderate\", \"low\" or \"very low\", based on the risk of bias (and other quality features) in the included studies, along with inconsistency of results, indirectness, imprecision and other factors deemed relevant.\n【89】 These assessments provided a starting point for the GDG when using the evidence on the health effects of interventions and exposures to develop the specific recommendations for the HHGL.\n【90】 Where possible, the systematic reviews included information on potential disadvantages as well as advantages of the proposed interventions. This, along with the expert knowledge of the GDG, was used to incorporate information on the feasibility, harms, acceptability and cost-benefit considerations during the development of the recommendations.\n【91】 The systematic reviews are available online at .\n【92】 # Formulation of recommendations\n【93】 The recommendations were formulated in two GDG meetings. The first took place face-to-face in Morges (Switzerland) on 13-15 July 2015, while the second took place by online video conference on 29 May 2018. The interval between the two meetings and the need for the second meeting was due to the time needed to assess the strength of the evidence as a whole, to update the systematic reviews and to draft the guidelines. For both meetings, the systematic reviews and GRADE evidence profile tables were shared with members of the GDG in advance. They were  discussed in preliminary teleconferences and other correspondence between the designated members of the GDG, the WHO Secretariat, systematic review teams and the methodologist. This led to the preparation of draft recommendations, which, together with the systematic reviews (in particular the summaries of evidence for the effects of the interventions or exposures on the prioritized health outcomes and the information on the quality of the evidence), were used by the GDG, WHO Secretariat and methodologist as a basis for discussing and agreeing the recommendations for each topic. The evidence from the systematic reviews was supplemented by the wide range and depth of experience across the GDG and, for instance, this information supported the assignment of the \"trivial\" categorization for the undesirable effects of some interventions, as detailed in the evidence to decision (EtD) tables.\n【94】 The EtD framework for public health was used to derive and formulate the recommendations. Each recommendation was defined as either \"strong\" or healthy housing, the GDG recognizes that not all recommendations will be implementable to the same extent and at the same time in all contexts. The implementation of the HHGL recommendations will require prioritization to best meet a country's most urgent needs, which can subsequently be expanded to longer term commitments to work gradually towards a full implementation.\n【95】 The GDG  considered resource use, which was not a standard feature of the studies available in the systematic reviews of health outcomes, but was available in some cases . Details of such considerations are provided in the EtD tables.\n【96】 # Decision-making during the GDG meetings\n【97】 The technical consultations were guided by a preset protocol, allowing participants to discuss the draft recommendations where necessary; each of the pre-drafted recommendations was revised through group discussion.\n【98】 The final recommendations were agreed on unanimously by the GDG; only the recommendation on cold was adopted through a majority vote. Any concerns expressed about the adopted strength of a recommendation are noted in the guidelines. WHO staff, the guideline methodologist and observers at the meetings were not eligible to vote. If an issue to be voted upon involved research (including systematic reviews) conducted by any member of the GDG who had declared a conflict of interest, the members in question would be allowed to participate in the discussion, but excluded from the final vote on that particular issue.\n【99】 # Declaration of interests by external contributors\n【100】 In accordance with WHO policy, all members of the GDG and ERG were required to complete and submit a WHO declaration of interest form. The WHO Secretariat, with support of the SG, reviewed and assessed the declarations submitted by each member and agreed on an approach to assess potential conflicts of interest.\n【101】 A briefing was provided at the beginning of the first GDG meeting in Washington (DC) (April  on the nature of all types of competing interests (i.e. financial, academic/intellectual and non-academic). Each member of the GDG was asked to discuss and declare to the meeting any conflicts they may have.\n【102】 All appointed members of the GDG and the ERG completed the WHO declaration of interest forms and no conflicts of interest were declared.\n【103】 # Document preparation and peer review\n【104】 The first draft recommendations from July 2015 were used as the basis for drafting the chapters of the HHGL. The draft chapters were prepared by the WHO Secretariat, designated members of the GDG and the methodologist, before being circulated to the GDG and the ERG as a whole for revision and approval. The WHO Secretariat used external reviewer comments to make suggested revisions to these initial drafts and further revisions and review took place of the revised draft in June 2018. The reviewers' comments and any suggested changes to the recommendations were then circulated to the GDG and SG for final agreement. No disagreement was expressed by reviewers.\n【105】 # Household crowding\n【106】 #   Household crowding\n【107】 Household crowding is a condition where the number of occupants exceeds the capacity of the dwelling space available, whether measured as rooms, bedrooms or floor area, resulting in adverse physical and mental health outcomes .\n【108】 The effects of crowding can be broadly defined as the hazards associated with inadequate space within the dwelling for living, sleeping and household activities . Crowding is considered to be stressful to health and well-being across different cultures and aspects of life in low-, middle-and high-income countries . Several studies have reported a direct association between crowding and adverse health outcomes, such as infectious disease and mental health problems. In addition, researchers have connected crowding to poor educational attainment .\n【109】 Worldwide, crowding is often a marker of poverty and social deprivation .\n【110】 Crowded households are  often exposed to housing risks discussed in other chapters in the HHGL. For example, the income constraints that compel people to live in dwellings with inadequate space for their needs  can  mean that such households struggle to afford housing that is in good repair or to heat homes sufficiently .\n【111】 In order to establish clear guidance on minimizing the health risks associated with crowding, a systematic review of the evidence was commissioned.\n【112】 # Question for the systematic review\n【113】 In the general population exposed to household crowding, what is the exposure-response relationship between exposure to crowding and the proportion of persons with poorer health compared with the population not exposed to household crowding?\n【114】 The systematic review focused on the following priority health outcomes:\n【115】 - close-contact infectious diseases\n【116】 - gastroenteritis and diarrhoeal diseases\n【117】 - mental health, including psychological stress - sleep disturbance.\n【118】 # Guideline recommendation\n【119】 # Strength of recommendation\n【120】 Strategies should be developed and implemented to prevent and reduce household crowding.\n【121】 - Each Member State should choose an appropriate way to measure the amount of crowding in a household, including a threshold that can be used to define a household as \"crowded\".\n【122】 - Implementing agencies can draw on a range of existing measures of crowding ( described as \"overcrowding\") to determine a measure appropriate to their context  . Specific guidance exists for emergency shelters . 4 - While the prevalence of infectious diseases varies between countries, the evidence of an association between crowding and adverse health effects is such that implementing agencies should work to reduce crowding regardless of the local prevalence of specific infectious diseases.\n【123】 Following United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) standards, emergency shelters located at public buildings are recommended to have 4.5-5.5 m 2 per evacuee (refugee) in cold climates, as residents remain inside the shelters during daytime .\n【124】 Overcrowding occurs if there are more than three people per habitable room .\n【125】 # American Crowding Index\n【126】 Crowding occurs if there is more than one person per room; severe crowding occurs if there are more than 1.5 persons per room (excluding bathrooms, balconies, porches, foyers, hall-ways and half-rooms) .\n【127】 # Argentinian National Institute of Statistics and Censuses\n【128】 Overcrowding represents the quotient between the total number of people in the home and the total number of rooms or pieces of the same .\n【129】 Households with critical overcrowding are considered those with more than three people per room (excluding the kitchen and bathroom) .\n【130】 # Canadian National Occupancy Standard\n【131】 Overcrowding occurs if extra bedrooms are required to ensure that each of the following have their own bedroom:\n【132】 - cohabiting adult couple - lone parent - unattached household member aged 18 years or over - same sex pair of children aged under 18 years - each additional boy or girl in the household (unless there are two opposite sex children under 5 years, in which case they can share a bedroom) .\n【133】 # British Bedroom Standard\n【134】 Overcrowding occurs if extra bedrooms are required to ensure that each of the following have their own bedroom:\n【135】 - cohabiting adult couple - person aged over 21 years - same sex pair of children aged 10-20 years - two children aged less than 10 years - two children where one is aged 10-20 and one is aged less than 10 years - any other person aged under 21 years that is not paired under one of the preceding categories .\n【136】 Overcrowding occurs if the household does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms equal to:\n【137】 - one room for the household - one room per couple in the household - one room for each single person aged 18 years or more - one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12-17 years - one room for each single person between 12-17 years and not included in the previous category - one room per pair of children under 12 years . - Having considered the certainty of the evidence, the balance of benefits to harms related to reducing crowding, the values and preferences associated with reducing crowding, and the feasibility of reducing crowding, the GDG made a strong recommendation.\n【138】 # Summary of evidence\n【139】 # Infectious diseases\n【140】 When interpreting the following results, it needs to be considered that the relationship between crowding and infectious diseases depends on the background prevalence of the disease in the specific setting.\n【141】 # Tuberculosis (TB)\n【142】 Much of the research on the association between crowding and infectious diseases concerns TB.\n【143】 Twenty-one studies -ten case-control , eight cross-sectional , two ecological  -were identified that related crowding to TB. These studies were consistent in showing that crowding is associated with increased risks of TB, even though the positive association was not statistically significant in a small number of the studies.\n【144】 Four studies investigated the effect of different levels of crowding on the incidence of TB .\n【145】 The certainty of the evidence that reducing crowding would reduce the risk of TB was assessed as high.\n【146】 # Respiratory diseases (excluding TB)\n【147】 Thirty studies reporting on outcomes due to respiratory infectious diseases other than TB were included in the systematic review. These investigated flurelated hospitalizations and illnesses: seven studies ; pneumonia: six studies ; acute respiratory illness: 16 studies ; and respiratory syncytial virus: . The study designs included 14 cross-sectional, six casecontrol, five cohort (including a randomized trial in which the intervention was not related to housing, which was an incidental variable) and five ecological studies.\n【148】 Across the majority of studies on non-TB respiratory diseases, the risk of acquiring the diseases was associated with crowding.\n【149】 The certainty of the evidence that reducing crowding would reduce the risk of non-TB respiratory disease was assessed as moderate to high, depending on the disease.\n【150】 # Diarrhoea and gastroenteritis\n【151】 Thirteen studies -two case-control .\n【152】 The certainty of the evidence that reducing crowding would reduce the risk of gastroenteritis and diarrhoeal diseases was assessed as high.\n【153】 # Other infectious diseases\n【154】 Twenty-five studies investigated an association between crowding and other infectious diseases such as rheumatic fever and heart disease: five studies ; typhoid fever: one study ; meningococcal disease: seven studies ; throat eye and skin infections: three studies . Study designs included ten cross-sectional, nine case control, one ecological and five cohort studies. In general, the risk of acquiring the infectious diseases was associated with crowding.\n【155】 The certainty of the evidence that reducing crowding would reduce the risk of other infectious diseases was assessed as moderate to low, depending on the disease.\n【156】 # Non-infectious health disorders\n【157】 # Mental health including stress\n【158】 Of the 13 separate studies in this category (one of which assessed two different mental health outcomes), eight studies reported at least one significant association between household crowding and the mental health outcome. A prospective cohort study , a retrospective cohort study  and five cross-sectional studies  all reported that participants living in a crowded household were more likely to report a mental health problem than those not living in crowded conditions. These mental health concerns included: psychological distress, alcohol abuse, feeling depressed and feeling unhappy about one's health. One cross-sectional study further found that crowding was associated with a lower prevalence of psychiatric disability .\n【159】 Four cross-sectional studies could not detect any relationship between crowding and mental health outcomes such as inattention-hyperactivity and emotional symptoms , psychological distress , suicidal ideation and self-esteem , or drug abuse . Further, one retrospective cohort study carried out in Israel reported no association between crowding during infancy and development of schizophrenia in later life  and one cohort study conducted in the United States of America found no link between overcrowding and autonomic nervous system reactivity or externalizing behaviour problems .\n【160】 The certainty of the evidence relating crowding to adverse mental health effects, including stress, was assessed as moderate to low.\n【161】 # Sleep disorders\n【162】 Two recent cross-sectional .\n【163】 The ecological study found a significant positive relationship between percentage of neighbourhood-level crowding (greater than one per room)\n【164】 and the apnoea-hypopnoea index .\n【165】 The certainty of the evidence that reducing crowding would reduce the incidence of sleep disorders was assessed as low to very low.\n【166】 In summary, the systematic review found high certainty evidence that crowding is associated with an increased risk of TB and diarrhoea. There is moderate to high certainty evidence for a positive relationship between crowding and other respiratory infectious diseases. The certainty of the evidence that crowding is associated with an elevated risk of other infectious diseases and poor mental health is moderate to low; and very low for the linkage between crowding and sleep disorders.\n【167】 # Considerations for implementation of the guideline recommendation\n【168】 Reducing crowding has implications for national and local governments, which usually need to build and refurbish housing, subsidize social or public housing, regulate private rental housing, implement tax and planning policies that encourage the building of affordable housing, and work with community leaders in informal settlements. Ensuring housing that is not only available, but  appropriate and affordable, is crucial to reducing crowding. If reducing crowding entails people moving to another location, it might have detrimental effects by removing them from social networks, child care support, and work or educational opportunities, affecting health and earning opportunities . Therefore, an integrated policy approach, in which reductions in crowding are supported by appropriate rehousing that takes these considerations about potentially unintended effects into account, is fundamental to equity. Reductions in crowding will be most effective if combined with policies that support employment and improve household incomes to increase the affordability of homes with sufficient space. A supportive social welfare system further ensures that loss of job or other income shock does not entail moving into a dwelling with inadequate space in order to reduce costs.\n【169】 When developing policies to reduce crowding, policy-makers and technical advisors  need to consider the relevance of crowding measures to different subpopulations . Depending on the cultural context, an inhabitant's perception of an overcrowded home might vary and different standards to determine adequate housing space might apply. 1 provides an overview of different crowding measures that can be applied to assess the prevalence and level of crowding in different settings.\n【170】 # Research recommendations\n【171】 The research reviewed shows that crowding is associated with negative health outcomes. However, the study designs, and the close association between social deprivation and crowding, caution against the attribution of causation.\n【172】 The research base could be further strengthened through focusing on the research priorities shown in 2. 5\n【173】 # Current state of the evidence\n【174】 Although there is good evidence on the association between crowding and poor health outcomes, most studies to date are observational and there is considerable heterogeneity in their design. Meta-analysis is difficult because studies define crowding differently, focus on different outcomes and subgroups of interest, and have used different approaches to adjust (or not) for confounding. Further high-quality studies are required, including randomized trials and comparative studies, perhaps using cluster randomized designs. Such studies might test the impact of new housing policies intended to reduce overcrowding, and subsequent effects on health outcomes. Future research should  examine the exposure-response relationships between crowding and health outcomes, including mental health outcomes and intellectual development of children, and make adjustments for confounding. In order to help others to compare, contrast and combine the results of different studies, researchers should use standard and internationally recognized measures of crowding and common approaches to recording and reporting outcomes.\n【175】 # Population of interest\n【176】 Populations living in residential housing. There is a particular need to understand the effects of crowding on different subpopulations (in particular men, women, children, the elderly, indigenous and at-risk populations).\n【177】 # Interventions of interest\n【178】 Policies and interventions to reduce crowding, including through extending existing homes, through rehousing and policies that support employment and improve household incomes.\n【179】 # Comparisons of interest\n【180】 Groups living in crowded and non-crowded home environments; groups before and after interventions to reduce crowding. It is  important to compare the effect on health of people living in different levels of crowding (i.e. \"crowding\" as opposed to \"severe crowding\") and people living for different lengths of time in crowded housing (exposureresponse relationships).\n【181】 # Outcomes of interest\n【182】 Key outcomes of interest are TB and other infectious diseases, gastroenteritis and diarrhoeal diseases, sleep quality, intimate partner violence and mental health.\n【183】 # Time stamp\n【184】 Current systematic review included studies published up to April 2018.\n【185】 #   Low indoor temperatures and insulation\n【186】 Cold air inflames lungs and inhibits circulation, increasing the risk of respiratory conditions, such as asthma attacks or symptoms, worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and infection. Cold  induces vasoconstriction, which causes stress to the circulatory system  that can lead to cardiovascular effects, including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), coronary heart disease, strokes, subarachnoid haemorrhage and death . Most of the evidence for the impact of cold on health comes from studies connecting outdoor temperatures to health outcomes. For example, cold spells are associated with increased mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity , and mortality and morbidity rates in countries with cold and temperate climates are higher in winter than in summer .\n【187】 Evidence that cold indoor temperatures have adverse consequences for health is growing . Cold indoor temperatures are often a consequence of outdoor temperature, structural deficiencies, including a lack of insulation and airtightness, and lack of heating. As outlined in this chapter, cold indoor temperatures have been associated with increased blood pressure, asthma symptoms and poor mental health. Cold homes contribute to excess winter mortality and morbidity. Most of the health burden can be attributed to both respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially for older people. In children, the excess winter health burden is mostly due to respiratory disease.\n【188】 Excess winter deaths due to cold housing has been estimated at 38 200 per year (12.8/100  in 11 selected European countries .\n【189】 Winter mortality is greater in countries with milder climates than in those with more severe winter conditions , in part because countries with mild winters often have homes characterized by poor domestic thermal efficiency that are harder to heat than well insulated houses in more extreme climates. In insulated dwellings, thermal insulation reduces conductive heat loss through the buildings' walls, ceilings and floors. Retrofitted insulation, otherwise known as \"weatherization\"  reduces convective heat loss by blocking unwanted air leaks through the building envelope. As outlined in this chapter, retrofitted insulation, weatherization, and heating can help mitigate the effect of otherwise cold housing on health.\n【190】 Socioeconomic factors play an important role in determining whether a dwelling is sufficiently warm. Income constraints force people to live in housing that is older, more likely to be poorly built and lacking insulation.\n【191】 These deficiencies, in addition to lack of energy affordability, can make it especially difficult for people on low incomes to heat their houses adequately.\n【192】 For example, a study carried out in South Africa showed that informal dwellings were more vulnerable than other types of dwellings to indoor temperature instability, which affected thermal comfort .\n【193】 In order to assess the evidence on minimizing the health risks associated with cold indoor temperatures and the effects of insulating houses, two systematic reviews were commissioned. that \"there is no demonstrable risk to human health of healthy sedentary people living in air temperature of between 18 and 24 °C\" .\n【194】 The systematic review focused on the following priority health outcomes, as ranked by the GDG:\n【195】 - respiratory morbidity and mortality\n【196】 - all cause-mortality in infants\n【197】 - hospital admissions\n【198】 - cardiovascular morbidity and mortality\n【199】 # Question for the second systematic review (intervention)\n【200】 Do people living in housing with insulation have better health outcomes than those living in housing without insulation?\n【201】 The systematic review focused on the following priority health outcomes, as ranked by the GDG:\n【202】 - respiratory morbidity and mortality\n【203】 - cardiovascular morbidity and mortality\n【204】 - hospital admissions - all cause-mortality - depression\n【205】 - high blood pressure.\n【206】 # Guideline recommendations\n【207】 # Strength of recommendation\n【208】 Indoor housing temperatures should be high enough to protect residents from the harmful health effects of cold. For countries with temperate or colder climates, 18 °C has been proposed as a safe and well-balanced indoor temperature to protect the health of general populations during cold seasons.\n【209】 In climate zones with a cold season, efficient and safe thermal insulation should be installed in new housing and retrofitted in old housing.\n【210】 - There is an association between cold indoor temperatures and adverse health effects, and an association between retrofitting insulation in housing and improved health outcomes. Implementing agencies should work to increase temperatures in cold homes, including through installing insulation with appropriate ventilation, as this is likely to have beneficial effects on health.\n【211】 - While current evidence is insufficient to establish the precise temperature below which adverse health effects are likely to occur, there is high certainty that taking measures to warm cold houses will have significant health benefits and a minimum of 18 °C is widely accepted.\n【212】 - A higher minimum indoor temperature than 18 °C may be necessary for vulnerable groups including older people, children and those with chronic illnesses, particularly cardiorespiratory disease .\n【213】 - The GDG assessed the certainty of the evidence to indicate the extent to which the research supports the recommendation. The certainty of the evidence that warming a cold house reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease is moderate (based on the findings for blood pressure). The certainty of the evidence that installing insulation is associated with improved health outcomes is high but this is qualified by different types of insulation.\n【214】 - Having considered the certainty of the evidence, the values and preferences associated with indoor thermal condition, the balance of benefits to harm related to increasing indoor temperatures and installing insulation, and the feasibility of taking these measures, the GDG made a strong recommendation regarding cold and a conditional recommendation regarding insulation.\n【215】 # Summary of evidence\n【216】 This section summarizes the systematic reviews of the associations between indoor cold and health outcomes, and the benefits to health of thermal insulation in the home environment. The systematic reviews on indoor cold and on insulation against cold and the GRADE tables used to assess the certainty of the evidence are available online at / sustainable-development/publications/housing-health-guidelines/en/index.\n【217】 html in Web Annex B and Web Annex C.\n【218】 # Respiratory morbidity and mortality\n【219】 Of the four studies identified in the systematic review, three found that colder indoor temperatures increased respiratory morbidity. One cross-sectional study in adults with COPD found better health status with more hours of indoor temperature at and above 21 °C. A dose-response trend was observed for number of days with bedroom temperatures of 18 °C and above for at least 9 hours. The greatest effects were observed in adults who smoked compared with non-smokers . Similarly, modelling based on the results of a randomized trial involving children with asthma found that every 1 °C increase in room temperature below the threshold of 9 °C, was associated with a small but significant increase in lung function. Bedroom exposure was shown to have stronger association with asthmatic children's lung function than living room exposure . In addition, one cohort study, including adults with COPD, from China reported reduced respiratory problems with an indoor temperature at 18.2 °C regardless of whether indoor humidity was low, moderate or high . In contrast, a case-control study in children with and without upper respiratory tract infections showed no consistent associations with indoor temperature .\n【220】 The certainty of the evidence that warming a cold house (perhaps to a minimum indoor temperature of 18 °C) would reduce the risk of respiratory mortality and morbidity was assessed as moderate.\n【221】 # Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: blood pressure\n【222】 Of the six included studies that assessed the association between indoor temperature and blood pressure, all showed that lower temperatures were associated with higher blood pressure, including two randomized trials in Japan that found higher blood pressure in people living in colder homes .\n【223】 A cohort study in Japan of adults over 60 years of age found that decreases of 1 °C in indoor temperatures were significantly associated with increased blood pressure levels at different times of the day, even after controlling for potential confounders .\n【224】 The review  identified five studies of temperature and blood pressure that were done under laboratory conditions . The studies show a relationship between warming and lower blood pressure but, because this is indirect evidence for the relationship between blood pressure and housing indoor temperature, the studies were not used in formulating the recommendations.\n【225】 The certainty of the evidence that warming a cold house (to a minimum indoor temperature of 18 °C) would reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was assessed as moderate.\n【226】 # Insulation and weatherization\n【227】 Of the 11 studies identified in the systematic review, seven found some association between the benefits of living in an insulated home and improved health. For example, a cluster randomized trial in New Zealand on the effect of insulating existing homes where at least one person in the household had existing chronic respiratory symptoms found that insulation was associated with reduced odds of poor mental health, self-reported wheezing in the previous 3 months, winter colds or flu, and morning phlegm in adults .\n【228】 While mental health was improved in one controlled trial from the United\n【229】 States of America, the study did not find any differences in general health status between people receiving new insulation and exterior cladding and those in the control group . One quasi-experimental study from the United Kingdom found no difference between asthmatic and healthy children with regard to different glazing systems . Another quasi-experimental study in New Zealand found that all-cause mortality was significantly lower in people with a history of cardiovascular disease if they lived in an insulated rather than an uninsulated house and non-significantly lower in people with a history of respiratory disease . Similarly, a controlled trial from the United Kingdom did not detect any effect of external insulation on general respiratory symptoms, asthma, physical or mental health or subjective well-being .\n【230】 A cross-sectional study from the United Kingdom investigated the effects of different types of insulation on a range of health outcomes . The study identified positive effects of loft and external wall insulation on respiratory, mental and general health; but found a negative impact on these outcomes with cavity wall insulation.\n【231】 Three retrospective cohort studies investigated the effects of living in an insulated home on health. A New Zealand study of 45 000 households, with matched controls, showed no relationship between living in an insulated home and rates of hospitalization. However, mortality rates for adults aged 65 and over who had previously been hospitalized for circulatory illness were lower for people living in insulated dwellings . A study from Scotland, looking at the indoor environment and health outcomes as reported by participants, found that rates of coughing were significantly lower in homes with doubleglazed windows but no consistent relationship between wheezing and coughing, and insulation . A study from Greenland, of households with children aged 3 to 5 and 8 years who had a previous medical attendance for acute otitis media, found no relationship between episodes of acute otitis media and self-reported poor insulation, defined as \"reports of draft along the floors and through doors and windows\" . A historical cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom reported that double glazing improved the household health status by 4.8% but did not detect effects on quality of life or other measures of well-being .\n【232】 One case-control study from Denmark, which had a high risk of bias, found that eye irritation and throat dryness (connected to respiratory health) decreased slightly when windows were replaced, but the results were not statistically significant .\n【233】 The certainty of the evidence that living in insulated homes is associated with improved health outcomes was assessed as moderate.\n【234】 # Considerations for implementation of the guideline recommendations\n【235】 In a cold climate, a healthy indoor thermal environment can be achieved through a combination of thermal insulation and heat supply. Building a properly ventilated and thermally insulated house is more technically advanced and expensive than building a non-insulated house, but is likely to lead to health and other benefits, with some evidence that the cost-benefit ratio can be as high as six . On a macro-level, improving energy efficiency of dwellings was found to lead to cost savings and in some countries the clear co-benefits of retrofitted insulation on health and energy efficiency mean that these retrofits are already subsidized by governments. For example, it is estimated that improvements in occupants' health by improving housing in the United Kingdom, including through increasing warmth in bedrooms, would save the United Kingdom health services £1.4 billion in the first year in treatment costs alone . An insulation subsidy programme in New Zealand found reduced hospitalization costs due to fewer re-admissions, fewer transfers and shorter stays in hospital, although the rate of hospitalization was unchanged . In Cape Town, retrofitting of 2300 houses with solar water heating and roof insulation as part of the Kuyasa low-income housing project had multiple benefits for climate mitigation, respiratory health, poverty reduction, and economic development . Besides generating 2.82 tonnes of carbon credit per house annually and lowering heating expenditures, the improved insulation led to a \"substantial decline in bronchial and related illness among residents, especially during winter\" . More broadly, energy efficiency measures contribute to public savings by reducing the burden on energy infrastructure and the climate. Insulation can  help moderate extreme heat situations, as discussed in Chapter 5. Yet, cost-effectiveness will vary significantly for different climate zones and depends on housing quality, the type of insulation, the prior level of insulation and means of heating and ventilation of the housing stock.\n【236】 At an individual level, there is a clear trade-off between investment costs (installing or retrofitting insulation and heating) and running costs (paying for energy). While people with low incomes are likely to benefit the most from public thermal efficiency programmes because they are more likely to live in cold homes , they will  be less likely to be able to afford to install insulation if the costs need to be covered by the inhabitants or home owners.\n【237】 Therefore, it is essential to ensure that low-income people can afford to live in improved buildings, potentially through providing public support for housing costs; otherwise improvements in insulation might increase inequities .  .\n【238】 Implementation  needs to consider the importance of using safe insulation materials, which are free of toxic substances such as asbestos and isocyanate, and are resistant to fire and microbial growth. Improved occupational safety and health protection and training for those involved in installing and maintaining thermal insulation may  be required to ensure that the health of workers is not compromised and that the intervention will be optimally effective . Authorization of the building retrofit designers and approval/ inspection of the actual work are necessary to ensure healthy and energy efficient results.\n【239】 # Research recommendations\n【240】 The specific mechanisms underlying the association between cold homes, lack of insulation, and poor health may involve both physiological responses or co-exposures to other associated factors causing adverse health problems, such as damp, mould, poor quality housing, poverty and social deprivation.\n【241】 Further research is needed to investigate these associations and underpin the research priorities summarized in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 for the exposure (cold) and for the intervention (insulation).\n【242】 # Current state of the evidence\n【243】 While there is good evidence associating low indoor temperatures with adverse health outcomes, further studies, especially in developing countries and particularly in Africa, are required which assess exposure-response associations while controlling for potential confounders (including outdoor temperature). These should take into account peak (occasional low temperatures), chronic (extended periods of low temperatures) and cumulative exposure .\n【244】 # Population of interest\n【245】 The whole population; in particular, people that are both more likely to spend time at home and experience adverse health effects related to cold (e.g. the elderly, children, and people with long-term illnesses). Studies are required to establish whether 18 °C is the most appropriate general target for the minimum indoor temperature and whether the minimum target should vary across different population groups.\n【246】 # Interventions of interest\n【247】 Policies and interventions to increase indoor temperatures to healthy levels, including through installing insulation, weatherization, and improved heating, including through alternatives such as solar panels, through subsidies and market-based initiatives .\n【248】 # Comparisons of interest\n【249】 Groups living in home environments in cold climates that are not heated to an adequate temperature and those that are; groups before and after intervention.\n【250】 # Outcomes of interest\n【251】 A range of health outcomes should be included, including indoor temperature and mortality and morbidity, and cardiovascular disease, asthma, COPD, infections and depression.\n【252】 # Time stamp\n【253】 Current systematic review on the association between indoor cold and health outcomes included studies published up to April 2018.\n【254】 # Current state of the evidence\n【255】 The evidence base on the effects of living in an insulated home on health outcomes should be strengthened through further high-quality studies, including randomized trials. These studies should control for confounding factors, including outdoor temperature, ventilation, and the availability, affordability and efficiency of heating. Research should prioritize professional, independent assessment of insulation levels and health outcomes over self-reports by occupants.\n【256】 # Population of interest\n【257】 The whole population; in particular, people that are both more likely to spend time at home and experience adverse health effects related to cold (e.g. the elderly, children, and people with long-term illnesses), who may particularly benefit from insulated housing.\n【258】 # Interventions of interest\n【259】 Installing insulation, and the introduction of market-based initiatives intended to encourage the installation of insulation.\n【260】 # Comparisons of interest\n【261】 Groups living in insulated and non-insulated home environments; groups before and after intervention.\n【262】 # Outcomes of interest\n【263】 Indoor temperature and relative humidity and change in air exchange rates, plus a range of health outcomes. These include indoor temperature and mortality and morbidity; in particular, cardiovascular disease, asthma, COPD, infections and depression.\n【264】 # Time stamp\n【265】 Current systematic review on the association between insulation and health outcomes included studies published up to April 2018. the temperature threshold where heat-related deaths begin to increase during a heat wave is lower in cities with cooler climates .\n【266】 The importance of acclimatization (i.e. physiological adaptation to excessive heat exposure) is stressed in the WHO-World Meteorological Organization (WMO) guideline for heat wave warning systems, but complete acclimatization to an unfamiliar thermal environment may take several years. Long-term adaptation results in a lower rise in core body temperature and a lower increase in heart rate at a given heat load . In addition, while people may adapt to usual temperatures, they may not be able to adapt to variable temperatures. Unstable temperatures harm the cardiovascular and immune system, and are associated with an increase of mortality .\n【267】 Studies have shown an association between high indoor temperatures and adverse health effects . Outside of regions where air conditioning is common, high indoor temperatures are associated with high outdoor temperatures. In a case cross-over study carried out in three Latin America cities, same and previous day apparent temperatures were strongly associated with mortality risk, with susceptibility increasing with age . Therefore, studies of morbidity and mortality rates during periods of high outdoor temperatures can  be used to provide indirect evidence of the harmful health effects of high indoor temperatures in such regions. For example, during the 2003 heat wave in France, the number of deaths at home was considerably higher compared with years without extreme heat events .\n【268】 In Japan, a study showed that heatstroke most often occurs at home during summer; elderly people developed heatstroke in their homes with greater frequency compared with patients in other age groups . In summary,\n【269】 given that people spend most of their time indoors  and that, in the absence of air conditioning, they will be exposed to an increased risk of high indoor temperatures during periods of high outdoor temperature, protection against outdoor heat is a key characteristic of healthy housing. The review identified six studies that included indoor dwelling temperature as an exposure variable. However, none of these studies provided direct evidence on the prioritized health outcomes or the minimal risk temperatures for heat-related health effects. Therefore, no firm answer can be given to the question of whether people living in housing with a temperature above 24 °C have worse health outcomes than those living in housing with an indoor temperature below that threshold.\n【270】 # Guideline recommendation\n【271】 # Strength of recommendation\n【272】 In populations exposed to high ambient temperatures, strategies to protect populations from excess indoor heat should be developed and implemented.\n【273】 - Identification of the minimal risk temperature for heat-related health effects will require research to determine the indoor temperature below which no adverse health effects related to heat are expected. Likewise, research is needed to identify the \"maximum acceptable temperature\", above which the risk to human health increases drastically. As people are acclimatized to different temperatures in different climate regions, the optimal indoor temperature range is dependent on the specific region.\n【274】 Examples of minimal risk temperature for heat-related health effects and maximum acceptable temperature are listed in infants, sick and the disabled, below the maximum acceptable temperature.\n【275】 - The GDG assessed the certainty of the evidence to indicate the extent to which the research on each health outcome supports the recommendation.\n【276】 As there are so few studies of the direct effect of high indoor temperature on health, the certainty of the evidence that reducing high indoor temperatures would reduce morbidity and mortality was assessed as low to very low.\n【277】 However, there is higher certainty of evidence that there is a relationship between high indoor and high outdoor temperatures and that high outdoor temperatures are associated with morbidity and mortality.\n【278】 - Therefore, having considered the certainty of this range of evidence on high temperature and health, the balance of benefits to harms of preventing exposure to high indoor temperature, the values and preferences associated with preventing exposure to high indoor temperature, and the cost and feasibility of preventing such exposure, the GDG made a conditional recommendation.\n【279】 # Summary of evidence\n【280】 The systematic review on the association between high indoor temperatures and adverse health outcomes identified eight eligible studies. Further, indirect evidence to support the association between high indoor temperatures and adverse health outcomes was identified in the following manner:\n【281】 Step 1: Studies on health and outdoor temperature were reviewed to obtain estimates of the relationship between outdoor temperature and health outcomes.\n【282】 Step 2: Studies that measured both indoor and outdoor temperature were reviewed and used to model the association between indoor and outdoor temperatures. This association was used to derive indoor temperature based on the outdoor temperature.\n【283】 - Step 3: An assumption was taken that the estimates derived in Step 1 would equally apply to the indoor temperatures calculated in Step 2. These were used to support the recommendations regarding high indoor temperatures.\n【284】 # Temperature and morbidity\n【285】 # Indoor temperature and morbidity\n【286】 Eight studies investigated the effect of indoor heat on health outcomes including, sleep disorders (three studies); general health, blood pressure, respiratory and cardiovascular disease (two studies each); and body temperature, mental health, pregnancy outcomes (one study each).\n【287】 One quasi-experimental study of 57 people in the United States of America found that reductions in number of days above 27 °C corresponded with improved quality of health and life, reduced emotional distress and increased hours of sleep .\n【288】 Three cohort studies explored the association between indoor heat and morbidity. While there were no associations between indoor temperatures and reports of respiratory viral infection or heat illness in a cohort of 40 households in the United States of America, the same study found a significant relationship in sleep problems and prior day's temperature in the summer season but not in winter . Similarly, among 113 elderly people in the Netherlands, an increase of 1 °C of indoor temperature raised the risk of sleep disturbance by 24% (in the temperature range of 20.8 to 29.3 °C) .\n【289】 A third cohort study, in Slovenia, reported worse cardiovascular symptoms with a higher heat burden and low indoor air quality .\n【290】 One case series involving 20 low-income elderly people in the Republic of Korea and one cohort study including 132 women in India, found a nonsignificant positive relationship between indoor temperature and systolic blood pressure but a significant positive association with diastolic blood pressure .\n【291】 A case-control study reported that humidity exposure and indoor heat above 26 °C non-significantly increased the proportion of emergency calls in New York that were due to cardiovascular cases and respiratory distress calls .\n【292】 Finally, a cross-sectional study among 1136 women in Ghana found a nonsignificant increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as stillbirth or miscarriage, with each additional 1 °C increase in atmospheric heat exposure .\n【293】 In view of the mixed findings and the relatively small amount of evidence, the certainty of the direct evidence that reducing high indoor temperatures would reduce morbidity or mortality was assessed as low.\n【294】 # Outdoor temperature and morbidity\n【295】 In order to help with the discussions in the GDG, analyses were  done of the effects of outdoor temperature, for which studies on the association between high temperature and morbidity show a non-linear temperature-effect relationship. For example, associations between daily average temperatures and the relative risk estimates for hospital admissions for kidney disease are U-shaped (admissions occur in both the lower and higher temperature ranges) or J-shaped (admissions occur in the higher temperature ranges).\n【296】 Temperatures at around 25 °C present the lowest risk for hospital admission for kidney disease, and high temperatures increase the risk of admission more than low temperatures . Although heat waves are significantly associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations , recent meta-analysis indicated no apparent association between increased ambient temperature and cardiovascular morbidity .\n【297】 The certainty of this evidence linking high outdoor temperature with increased morbidity was assessed as low to moderate and, although indirect, it was used in conjunction with the evidence on the relationship between outdoor and indoor temperature to provide support for the recommendation on indoor temperatures.\n【298】 # High temperature and mortality\n【299】 # High indoor temperature and mortality\n【300】 No eligible studies assessed the effect of high indoor temperature on mortality.\n【301】 # High outdoor temperature and mortality\n【302】 Reviews and meta-analyses provide strong evidence of the association between high outdoor temperature and mortality .\n【303】 The certainty of the evidence relating high outdoor temperature to mortality was assessed as high, and, although indirect, it was used in conjunction with the evidence on the relationship between outdoor and indoor temperature to provide support for the recommendation regarding indoor temperatures.\n【304】 # Relationship between indoor and outdoor temperature\n【305】 Thirty-two studies were identified which reported the relationship between indoor and outdoor temperature. These showed a positive correlation in the higher temperature range (>20 °C). The slope of a linear regression between outdoor and indoor temperatures in the warm/hot temperature range (>20 °C)\n【306】 varied depending on several factors including air conditioning, ventilation, insulation, building direction, socioeconomic status and the behaviour of the occupants.\n【307】 Most of the studies were conducted in temperate climate zones. The studies show that the slope of the correlation curves between indoor and outdoor temperatures in this climate zone was usually not steep, which may be due to the influence of air conditioning in some dwellings  and the practice of keeping the windows closed rather than opening them for ventilation .\n【308】 Specific cities have unique correlation curves . Some studies are better able to predict indoor temperatures from outdoor temperatures by incorporating other environmental factors into a multivariate regression.\n【309】 These factors include urban heat islands affecting the immediate environment , solar radiation .\n【310】 Fewer studies have been done in subtropical regions, but these  suggest relationships between indoor and outdoor temperatures. In low-income countries, where air conditioning is seldom available, indoor temperature is directly related to outdoor temperature . The relationship becomes weaker further away from the equator .\n【311】 The certainty of the evidence that indoor and outdoor temperatures are correlated was assessed as moderate to high, and this indirect evidence was used in conjunction with the evidence on the relationship between high outdoor temperatures and adverse health outcomes to provide support for the recommendation regarding indoor temperatures.\n【312】 # Considerations for implementation of the guideline recommendation\n【313】 Thermal insulation, housing location, building materials and house orientation,\n【314】 # Research recommendations\n【315】 Some of the evidence summarized in this chapter is indirect, based on the association between indoor and outdoor temperatures, and the association between high outdoor temperatures and health outcomes. However, there is great variation between outdoor and indoor temperatures in terms of the types of heat exposure (direct or indirect sun), the types of activity typically carried out, and the possible interactions with other risk factors associated with housing, including humidity, housing conditions, socioeconomic conditions, the type of structure (including insulation), ventilation/air conditioning, and outside temperature. Further research should therefore focus on the direct effects of high indoor temperatures on health.\n【316】 # Current state of the evidence\n【317】 Few high-quality studies have assessed the direct effects of indoor temperature on health.\n【318】 The current research base is limited by a lack of data on indoor household temperature and the difficulty of designing studies capable of entirely excluding the health impact of outdoor temperatures. High-quality studies that control for confounders are required. These should focus on exposure-response associations and take into account peak (occasional high temperatures), chronic (extended periods of high temperatures) and cumulative exposure.\n【319】 # Population of interest\n【320】 The whole population; in particular people who are both more likely to spend time at home and experience adverse health effects related to heat (the elderly, children, women, obese people, and people with long-term illnesses). Studies across different groups will help establish whether the threshold level (the temperature above which temperature poses a risk to health) is different for different population groups.\n【321】 # Interventions of interest\n【322】 Installing ventilation and other measures aimed at reducing indoor temperature in housing in hot climates; and moving people to cooler housing in hot climates.\n【323】 # Comparisons of interest\n【324】 Groups living in hot climates in home environments at different temperatures; groups before and after interventions to reduce indoor temperatures.\n【325】 # Outcomes of interest\n【326】 A range of health outcomes should be included, including mortality and morbidity generally, but, in particular, cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, respiratory symptoms, sleep disturbance, heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration.\n【327】 # Time stamp\n【328】 Current systematic review on the direct association between high indoor temperatures and health outcomes included studies published up to April 2018. The literature review to provide evidence on the indirect relationship between high indoor temperatures and health was done by members of the GDG in April 2016.\n【329】 #   Injury hazards\n【330】 Injuries in the home present an important health burden worldwide .\n【331】 Globally, around a third of injuries occur in the home , and, in 2016, half of all unintentional injury-related deaths occurred in the home . Although injuries in the home affect people of all ages, home injury rates are highest in the youngest and oldest age groups . They are  more common in people with functional impairment and interventions to improve their housing conditions are discussed in Chapter 7.\n【332】 Injuries in the home include falls, burns, poisonings, ingestion of foreign objects, smoke inhalation, drowning, cuts and collisions with objects, and crushing and fractured bones as a result of structural collapse. This chapter focuses on injuries caused by hazards that can be eliminated or controlled with proper attention to housing design and maintenance .\n【333】 Falls account for the largest proportion of the injuries in the home that require medical attention . Worldwide, about 424 000 individuals die each year from falls, of which the vast majority are in low-and middle-income countries, and more than 37 million falls require medical attention . In Thailand, for example, almost 70% of severe injuries related to accidental falls occur in the home or residential areas . Similarly, falls are the leading cause for hospital admissions due to injuries in Fiji . In India, the rate of deaths from falls in urban areas, including the home, was 15.6 per 100 000 in 2005 . In high-income countries, about 26% of falls can be attributed to the environment, both inside and outside the home. In low-and middle-income countries, about 31% of falls are attributable to the environment . Hazards that encourage slips and falls that could result in injuries inclu\n【334】 and windows and doors without child safety locks . In Europe, in 2010, around 10 deaths (0.007 per 100  and 3310 DALYs (2.0 per 100  were attributable to a lack of window guards (that is, bars and other products that prevent people falling from windows) .\n【335】 The home environment can  put people at risk of injury and death from burns. Injury from exposure to heat, fire and hot substances results from hazards such as an absence of smoke detectors, unsafe electric installation, open fires, unprotected hot surfaces and hot water. Around 268 000 deaths occur each year worldwide due to burns from exposure to fire, heat or hot substances, including in the home environment . In the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, kerosene use for cooking and lighting remains widespread, with fires and explosions being well-documented kerosene hazards . More specifically, in one hospital in Sri Lanka, 41% of patients admitted for burns had been injured by falling kerosene lamps .\n【336】 In Bangladesh, the overall burn mortality rate was 2.2 per 100 000 in 2003, with 90% of burn incidences occurring in the home mostly caused by cooking fire, heating fire and fire from kerosene lamps . In Europe, 7523 deaths (0.9 per 100  and nearly 200 000 DALYs (22.4 per 100  are attributable to a lack of smoke detectors . Nearly a quarter of scald burns in children in the United States of America were caused by hot tap water . Unvented gas or solid fuel burning stoves  expose people to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide (discussed in Chapter .\n【337】 Injury rates at home are sometimes higher for low-income people . This is partly because homes that contain hazards are more likely to be within the price range of people with low incomes. For example, a United States of America survey reported that fire extinguishers, fire escape plans and carbon monoxide alarms were much less common in low-income homes . In Thailand, severe injuries are more common for unskilled labourers than other population groups ; and in Kenya, a low level of education was identified as a key risk factor for burn injury among patients admitted to a public hospital . Reducing hazards in homes can therefore contribute to reducing health inequalities .\n【338】 In order to establish clear guidance on minimizing the health risk associated with hazards in the home, a systematic review of the evidence was commissioned.\n【339】 Question for the systematic review Do residents in housing with fewer hazards have fewer injuries than residents living in housing with more hazards?\n【340】 The systematic review focused on the following priority health outcomes, as ranked by the GDG:\n【341】 - electrocution - broken or fractured bones\n【342】 - mortality due to injuries\n【343】 - burns or scalds\n【344】 - hospitalization (outpatient or inpatient) due to injuries.\n【345】 Although it was recognized that injuries due to building collapse are an important health issue; the focus for these guidelines was on hazards present within the house.\n【346】 # Guideline recommendation\n【347】 # Strength of recommendation\n【348】 Housing should be equipped with safety devices (such as smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, stair gates and window guards) and measures should be taken to reduce hazards that lead to unintentional injuries.\n【349】 - There is strong evidence for an association between hazards in the home and injuries. Implementing agencies should work to reduce the number of hazards in housing, because reducing these hazards is likely to have beneficial effects on health.\n【350】 - In addition to increasing the risk of burn injuries, fireplaces and fuelburning appliances can contribute to poor health outcomes and poor indoor air quality. WHO guidelines around household fuel combustion are summarized in section 8.2.\n【351】 - The GDG assessed the certainty of evidence to indicate the extent to which the research on each intervention supports the overall recommendation, and, in general, the certainty of the evidence for reducing hazards in the home is moderate to high. In relation to specific safety devices and safety measures, the certainty of the evidence that reducing fire hazards (through installing smoke detectors) reduces the risk of burns is moderate. The certainty of evidence that the use of guards to protect against fires and hot surfaces reduces the risk of burns is low to moderate. The certainty of the evidence that installing stair gates and window guards reduces the risk of falls is low to moderate. The certainty of the evidence that home safety modification programmes reduce the risk of injury is moderate.\n【352】 - Having considered the certainty of the evidence, the balance of benefits to harm of modifying the home to prevent home injury, and the values, preferences and feasibility of doing so, the GDG made a strong recommendation.\n【353】 # Summary of evidence\n【354】 The recommendations were informed by a systematic review of the evidence on the exposure-response relationship between housing factors and injury.\n【355】 The systematic review and the GRADE tables used to assess the certainty of the evidence are available online at  in Web Annex E.\n【356】 # Smoke detectors\n【357】 Properly installed and functioning smoke alarms were found to reduce the incidence of burn injuries. A randomized trial in the United States of America found that burns and fires in the homes were prevented by smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors at baseline and at 12 and 24 months' followup .\n【358】 A Canadian case-control study found an increased risk of burns and scalds in children if their house did not have a smoke alarm . Similarly, a casecontrol study in Iraq found that, among children admitted to hospital, there were fewer smoke alarms in the homes of those who had sustained a burn injury . Another study, in the United Kingdom, reported that among children seeking primary care, admitted to hospital, or presenting to the emergency department, those with burn injuries were less likely to have working smoke alarms in the home . However, another case-control study, in the United States of America, reported that burn cases had similar rates of smoke alarm usage and use of carbon monoxide detectors .\n【359】 The evidence that smoke alarms reduce the risk of hospitalization is supported by two additional cohort studies. One found that the introduction of legislation for compulsory smoke alarm ownership in an Australian state decreased hospitalization rates by 36.2% annually . The other found that fire-related death and injury were lower in the population with an installed smoke alarm than in the population without a smoke alarm .\n【360】 The certainty of the evidence that the presence of smoke detectors reduces the risk of injury was assessed as moderate.\n【361】 # Stair and safety gates\n【362】 Three studies reported on the effects of stair or safety gates on injury in children. A cohort study in the United Kingdom found that among children under 5 years of age, those who lived in homes that had been fitted with stair safety gates were less likely to be admitted to hospital, to attend primary care or to access the accident and emergency department . A case-control study in Bangladesh found that children living in homes where the kitchen did not have a door were more likely to sustain burns . This finding is supported by a case-control study from the United Kingdom, in which not using safety gates was associated with a significant increase in scalds .\n【363】 The certainty of the evidence that installing stair and safety gates reduces the risk of injury was assessed as low to moderate.\n【364】 # Window guards\n【365】 One cross-sectional study from the United States of America assessed the effect of window guard legislation. Window guards were found to be twice as effective in preventing falls than windows without guards .\n【366】 The certainty of the evidence that window guards reduce the risk of injury was assessed as low to moderate.\n【367】 # Fireplace guards, stoves and unprotected hot surfaces\n【368】 Three studies investigated the effects of fireplace and stove guards on injury. A case-control study in the United States of America found that people admitted to hospital to treat burns were likely to use fireplace guards less often than the control group . In contrast, a cohort study from the United Kingdom found no association between fire guard use and burn injuries . A Canadian case-control study reported an increased risk for burns or scalds when there was no stove guard to prevent children from grabbing pots .\n【369】 Other studies have looked at how the presence of specific lamps or heaters affects the risk of injury. A case-control study in the Islamic Republic of Iran found that the odds of burn injury were twice as high in homes with unvented air heaters rather than conventional vented kerosene-or gas-burning heaters . A pre-post intervention study in India found that the number of unintentional burns was reduced to zero from 23 among 1042 households in the 6 months after kerosene lamps were replaced with solar or LED lamps . In the Bangladesh case-control study, burns were more likely in children in the presence of a traditional kerosene lamp , and a case-control study in Iraq found that people who had been burned or scalded were more likely to use kerosene heaters for space heating .\n【370】 The certainty of the evidence that guarding against fireplaces, stoves and dangerous unprotected hot surfaces reduces the risk of injury was assessed as low to moderate.\n【371】 # Home safety modification programmes\n【372】 Five randomized trials studied the effect of home safety assessment and modification programmes on injuries .\n【373】 The certainty of the evidence that home safety modification programmes reduce the risk of injury was assessed as moderate.\n【374】 # Association between the number of hazards in the home and the incidence of injuries\n【375】 Four case-control studies found a dose-response relationship between the number of home hazards and the need for medical consultations or visits to health care services. A New Zealand study reported an estimated increase of 22% in the odds of injury occurrence associated with each additional home injury hazard . A Canadian study of adults aged 65 years and over found that an increase in the number of home hazards was associated with an increased risk of a second fall-related medical visit . While at the other end of the age spectrum, a study of children (aged 9 months to 3 years) in the United Kingdom found that those who lived in homes without any of the four hazards measured (no fire guard, safety gate, smoke alarms and electric socket covers) were approximately 20% less likely to have been injured than those with all four hazards . Finally, a study that compared residents in a high fall rate building and a low fall rate building in Florida, United States of America, found fewer environmental hazards in the low fall rate building .\n【376】 In addition, several other studies investigated the association between single hazards such as slippery floors, uncovered furniture corners or a lack of grab bars in the shower , with the majority of studies finding a positive relationship between the presence of hazards in the home and unintended injuries.\n【377】 The certainty of the evidence that a higher number of hazards in the home is associated with an increased risk of injury was assessed as moderate to high.\n【378】 While many injury prevention interventions have been tested in high-income settings, the GDG deems the suggested prevention measures generalizable to middle-and low-income countries. This is because injuries have certain antecedents. For example, burns are caused by excessive heat. Similarly, injury prevention has certain universal interventions applicable to all contexts, e.g. burns can be prevented by smoke alarms.\n【379】 # Considerations for implementation of the guideline recommendation\n【380】 Several tools are available to help assess and improve home safety. These include housing-based health risk assessment methodologies such as the English Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the United States National Healthy Housing Standard, or the New Zealand Rental Warrant of Fitness (developed from the Healthy Housing Index) (242,. Using such checklists relevant to local housing type, including adapting these to low-income settings and a variety of housing environments, can help prioritize interventions and ensure that serious hazards are not ignored or overlooked .\n【381】 Taking action to reduce hazards in the home can be efficiently carried out alongside housing improvements that address other risk factors covered by these guidelines. One key instrument in reducing hazards in housing is mandated requirements, accompanied by effective enforcement measures.\n【382】 Measures should be put in place to ensure that codes rapidly integrate injury and building science. In addition, subsidies and tax incentives can encourage safety modifications. Such measures can be supported by education campaigns to teach the public what they can do to reduce the risk of injury in the home .\n【383】 Reducing injury hazards in the home is likely to provide considerable health benefits, particularly for the poorest people, children, the elderly, the disabled and other at-risk populations living in the lowest quality housing. This action is likely to be cost-effective because the benefits from fewer injury-related hospitalizations have been shown to be larger than the costs of improving home safety, resulting in net benefits . Housing that is in such a state of disrepair that it cannot be modified may have to be demolished.\n【384】 Therefore, implementing this HHGL recommendation will probably need to be accompanied by the provision of new low-income housing to avoid potentially inequitable consequences.\n【385】 # Research recommendations\n【386】 The research reviewed suggests that interventions aimed at reducing hazards in the home are associated with positive health outcomes, but there are continuing uncertainties about the size of the benefits and the impact of specific interventions. The research base would be strengthened by focusing on a number of priorities.\n【387】 # Current state of the evidence\n【388】 Some studies were not included in the review because they assessed multicomponent interventions, making the effect of home structure modification on health outcomes difficult to distinguish from other interventions to decrease injuries (such as behaviour change). Future studies might consider using factorial designs to enable analyses of the effects of the specific interventions that make up a multicomponent intervention in different locations. These need to be large enough to have adequate power to detect the effect on different outcomes. In addition, more research is needed to assess the exposureresponse relationship between the number and type of hazards, the amount of time spent in the home, and the frequency and magnitude of injury.\n【389】 # Population of interest\n【390】 The whole population, in particular, people from low-and middle-income countries and those both more likely to spend time at home and experience adverse health effects due to injury (e.g. the elderly, children, women and people with long-term illnesses).\n【391】 # Interventions of interest\n【392】 Reducing injury hazards in housing, including through installing safety devices and removing hazards.\n【393】 # Comparisons of interest\n【394】 Groups living in home environments where home modifications aimed at reducing the risk of injury have been carried out and where home modifications have not been carried out; and groups before and after such interventions.\n【395】 # Outcomes of interest\n【396】 Injuries, including electrocution, broken or fractured bones, mortality due to injuries, burns or scalds, and hospitalization (outpatient or inpatient) due to injuries.\n【397】 # Time stamp\n【398】 Current systematic review on the association between hazards in the home and injury included studies published up to April 2018.\n【399】 #   Housing accessibility\n【400】 Disability is an umbrella term describing physical or psychological impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions . At least 1 billion people, or 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability . The disabled population is increasing as the world's population ages . Disability disproportionately affects low-income households, and has a higher prevalence in low-and middle-income countries . Disability can cause and contribute to poverty . People with functional impairment are more likely to be discriminated against when looking for housing, and more likely to pay high costs for housing relative to their income .\n【401】 # According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\n【402】 Disabilities, Member States have an obligation to identify and eliminate all barriers to accessibility, including in housing .\n【403】 As functioning and disability result from an \"interaction between the person's health condition and both personal and environmental factors\" , contextual factors substantially determine whether an impairment is perceived as disabling. Accessible dwelling can improve a person's domain-specific functioning within their home. Life span housing ( known as life cycle housing, lifetime homes or adaptable housing) can accommodate changes in human functioning over a person's life span, enabling the occupants to remain in their homes as long as possible. Universal design (or universal housing) is an approach to the design, construction and adaptation of housing to meet the needs of all occupants regardless of their age, functioning or social situation .\n【404】 Most homes are not currently built with accessibility in mind. For example, only about one fifth of public buildings in Enugu city, Nigeria, were found to be accessible for wheelchair users . However, there is a high chance that they will be occupied by people with disablities at some time, especially considering the trend of ageing populations. In the United States of America, it has been estimated that there is a 60% probability that any new house will be occupied by a person with a functional impairment over its life span . Nonaccessible home environments expose people with functional impairments to risk of falls and injuries, restricts social participation, negatively affects quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers and external social services . They limit a person's ability to manoeuvre in different spaces.\n【405】 In order to establish clear guidance on maximizing the health gains associated with accessible housing, a systematic review of the evidence on the effects of home improvements for people with functional impairment was commissioned.\n【406】 # Question for the systematic review\n【407】 Do residents with functional or cognitive impairments living in accessible/ usable home environments have better health/social outcomes than residents with functional or cognitive impairments living in conventional or unmodified home environments?\n【408】 The systematic review focused on the following priority health outcomes, as ranked by the GDG:\n【409】 - injury rates (especially falls)\n【410】 - well-being/quality of life\n【411】 - mental health/depression\n【412】 - dependency on external social or care services\n【413】 - social participation.\n【414】 # Guideline recommendation\n【415】 # Strength of recommendation\n【416】 Based on current and projected national prevalence of populations with functional impairments and taking into account trends of ageing, an adequate proportion of the housing stock should be accessible to people with functional impairments.\n【417】 - People with functional impairments living in accessible home environments have better health and are better able to accomplish everyday tasks and manage living independently than those living in conventional or inaccessible home environments. Implementing agencies should work to ensure that people with functional impairments live in accessible housing, because this is likely to have beneficial effects on health. The recommendation is limited to the effect of housing accessibility on people with functional impairments because of the small number of studies focusing on people with cognitive impairments.\n【418】 - Each implementing agency should determine what percentage of the housing stock is required to be \"adequate\" to meet the needs of the population with functional impairments. They should do this by considering current and projected national prevalence of people with functional impairments and trends in ageing. A good discussion on estimation methods is available . The level required for \"adequate\" provision will need to be reviewed as the population changes; in particular, as it ages.\n【419】 Given that accessible housing is not exclusively occupied by people with functional impairments, it is likely that the proportion of accessible housing stock would be higher than the proportion of households that include people with functional impairments.\n【420】 - Implementing agencies can draw on a range of existing programmes that target an increase in the supply of accessible dwellings.\n【421】 - The GDG assessed the certainty of the evidence to indicate the extent to which the research supports the recommendation and, in general, the certainty of the evidence for interventions to improve the accessibility and usability of the houses of people with functional impairment is moderate, supporting the decision to provide a strong recommendation. This overall certainty arises from a consideration of the accumulated evidence as a whole, which suggests important benefits for this disadvantaged population even though the evidence is of low certainty for some interventions and outcomes. In relation to specific aspects of the findings from the systematic review and other information, the certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments are better able to accomplish activities of daily living when living in accessible environments was assessed as low to moderate; the certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments are less likely to fall and be injured when living in accessible environments was assessed as moderate; the certainty of the evidence that living in accessible environments reduces the mortality rate of people with functional impairments was assessed as low; and the certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments experience positive psychological effects and improved quality of life when living in accessible environments was assessed as low to moderate.\n【422】 - Having considered the certainty of the evidence, the balance of benefits to harm related to increasing the supply of accessible dwellings, and the feasibility of increasing the supply of accessible dwellings, the GDG made a strong recommendation.\n【423】 # Summary of evidence\n【424】 This recommendation was informed by a systematic review of the evidence on the impact of accessible housing on residents with functional or cognitive impairments. The systematic review and the GRADE tables used to assess the certainty of the evidence are available online at / sustainable-development/publications/housing-health-guidelines/en/index. html in Web Annex F.\n【425】 Twenty studies, including six randomized trials, were eligible for the systematic review. Almost all the studies focused on people with functional impairments, with only one study of people with cognitive impairments . Interventions implemented to enhance home accessibility features were carried out either as a sole intervention or as part of a multicomponent programme. Home modifications were mainly focused on architectural changes or fitted devices (such as grab bars) targeting mobility issues. Some focused on lighting improvements or adjustments targeting vision.\n【426】 # Activities of daily living\n【427】 Functional impairments are often operationalized in terms of whether a person can accomplish activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). IADL refers to basic tasks of everyday life such as bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, continence and feeding.\n【428】 ADL refers to a range of activities that are required for independent living in the community, such as preparing meals, housekeeping, taking medication, shopping, managing one's own finances, travelling and using the telephone.\n【429】 Some studies reported the effects of interventions on ADL/IADL related outcomes. Three studies reported considerable decreases in perceived difficulties performing ADL/IADL after home modifications ; but difficulty with mobility/transfer did not change . Self-efficacy, which was defined as confidence in managing difficulty, was improved in one intervention group . Increased safety with ADL/IADL was  identified 2 months after home modifications among adults with impairments. The greatest safety benefits were in regard to bathroom use and entry access  and to difficulty in bathing and toileting . In addition, one population-based survey identified a strong association between self-recognized difficulty managing ADL and perceived unmet needs for home accessibility features among people with physical impairments, after adjusting for the severity of their physical limitations . This suggests that people who already have difficulties functioning in everyday life can benefit from home accessibility features, possibly delaying further deterioration of their functioning.\n【430】 One randomized trial involving people with visual impairments did not identify a significant improvement overall in self-rated certainty in performing specific activities 6 months after lighting adjustments . In addition, two studies found no significant change in dependence with ADL/IADL at 2 months and up to 9 months after home modifications .\n【431】 Three further studies investigated the impact of interventions on general ADL.\n【432】 One randomized trial involving adults above the age of 60 who had had surgery for hip fracture in Finland did not detect any significant effects on general ADL or IADL . However, a quasi-experimental study conducted in Thailand found that home modifications improved abilities in all function areas except for participants with severe degrees of difficulties , and a cross-sectional study involving participants from Sweden and Germany showed improvements in various aspects of ADL .\n【433】 The certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments living in accessible environments are better able to accomplish activities of daily living was assessed as low to moderate.\n【434】 Studies showed that home modifications aimed at reducing the likelihood of falls and injuries for people with functional impairments were successful in doing so. One randomized trial reported 41% fewer falls after 1 year in the home safety programme with a group of older adults with severe visual impairments, compared with those who did not receive this programme .\n【435】 A longitudinal prospective cohort study identified a significant reduction in falls at home and post-fall hospitalizations among frail older adults after the use of a light path coupled with tele-assistance . Two other studies reported a significantly lower mortality rate in the intervention group over the control group after the implementation of the multicomponent home modification programme. The programme included training to promote healthy behaviours .\n【436】 The certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments living in accessible environments have reduced fall and injury rates was assessed as moderate.\n【437】 One randomized trial, reported in two papers  reported a significantly lower mortality rate in the intervention group over the control group up to 2 years after the implementation of the multicomponent programme, which included home modifications as well as training strategies to promote healthy behaviours. However, there was no statistically significant effect on survival 3 years after the intervention.\n【438】 The certainty of the evidence that living in accessible environments reduces the mortality rate of people with functional impairments was assessed as low.\n【439】 # Quality of life\n【440】 Two randomized trials .\n【441】 Conversely, a cross-sectional study with adults with dementia found no association between quality of life and home safety and accessibility factors such as hazards, grab bars and visual cues .\n【442】 The certainty of the evidence that living in accessible environments improves the quality of life of people with functional impairments was assessed as low.\n【443】 # Psychological effects\n【444】 Three studies identified positive psychological effects of home accessibility interventions for people with functional impairments .\n【445】 The certainty of the evidence that people with functional impairments living in accessible environments experience positive psychological effects was assessed as moderate.\n【446】 One cross-sectional study conducted in Sweden concluded that accessibility problems were significantly associated with less participation and autonomy and more participation problems .\n【447】 # Considerations for implementation of the guideline recommendation\n【448】 A report from New Zealand concluded that it would be approximately 22 times more cost-efficient to build housing that includes key accessibility features than to retrofit when an unplanned need arises . However, in 2006, only 56% of countries had accessibility criteria in their building standards . Introducing such national regulations in a large number of countries could therefore lead to more inclusive societies and avoid extensive expenditures on retrofitting. It needs, however, to be noted that globally only a very small proportion of the housing stock will be newly built, while most of the housing stock requires retrofitting. Accessibility needs therefore to be ensured in regulation both for existing and new dwellings. The international standard \"ISO 21542:2011 Building construction -Accessibility and usability of the built environment\", published by the International Organization for Standardization, specifies a range of requirements and recommendations including on construction aspects of housing accessibility . Information on low-cost home modifications to increase housing accessibility in low-income settings is available from community-based rehabilitation programmes in India, using guidelines for care and community integration after spinal cord injury produced by the Government of India and the WHO Community-based rehabilitation guidelines .\n【449】 Besides the public sector, the private sector is a major partner in promoting accessible housing. One such a multistakeholder collaboration has been initiated by the National Cooperative Housing Union in Kenya by linking government, disability groups and the private sector to identify available land and providing technical assistance and loan capital to facilitate accessible housing construction . In Australia, the housing industry developed a target of having all new homes meet the Australian Liveable housing design guidelines by 2020. Those guidelines describe a number of elements that make a home more responsive to the changing needs of home occupants . However, voluntary schemes require extensive education and training programmes to highlight the benefits of accessible housing.\n【450】 Progress towards increasing the stock of accessible housing should be carefully monitored. If sufficient progress is not being made using a voluntary programme, it may be necessary to introduce a mandatory programme. Such schemes are usually introduced gradually. For example, Portugal's compulsory scheme was phased in over 8 years . In Sweden, every local authority is legally obliged to provide home modifications for people with impairments . However, planning for home modification requires consultation with service users as well as health and architectural professionals to ensure the users' needs are met appropriately. Home modifications that are poorly implemented due to bad planning or administrative errors may have a negative impact on physical and mental health of persons with impairments .\n【451】 Accessible housing should consider other factors related to healthy housing in addition to usability for occupants. If providing a household with an accessible dwelling entails people moving to another location, it could potentially remove them from social networks, child care support, and work or educational opportunities, affecting health and earning opportunities .\n【452】 # Research recommendations\n【453】 The research reviewed suggests that living in accessible housing supports the health of people with impairments. However, high-quality research in this area is difficult because allocating people to a comparison group is not always possible: the home modifications might be mandated under law, or it may be unethical to deny or delay accessibility improvements. 1 lists the research priorities in this area.\n【454】 # Current state of the evidence\n【455】 There are relatively few high-quality studies, with most studies to date being observational or small. The participants and types of intervention reviewed vary greatly. Some studies rely on subjective self-reporting rather than objective performancebased measures, and use different psychometric instruments to identify quality of life outcomes. There are few studies conducted outside of high-income settings, and most of the research focuses on the experience of adults. For some studies, it is not clear which component of the intervention was most effective. Future studies might consider using factorial designs to enable analyses of the effects of the specific interventions that make up a multicomponent intervention. Longitudinal studies, using standardized outcome measurements, are required to provide a stronger evidence base for the health and social benefits of home accessibility interventions.\n【456】 # Population of interest\n【457】 Populations with a range of physical and cognitive impairments. Much of the current evidence is based on research with adults with physical impairments in high-income settings; future research should consider people with cognitive impairments, people in low-income settings, and children and young adults.\n【458】 # Interventions of interest\n【459】 Improving accessibility of housing. This could include modification of specific furniture and fixtures in the house; structural changes to the inside and immediate outside of the house; and assistive devices that are part of the house. Studies should consider how different accessibility features affect health and social outcomes for people with specific impairments. Research should determine which accessibility features affect these outcomes for people with different impairments.\n【460】 # Comparisons of interest\n【461】 Groups living in accessible and conventional/unmodified home environments; a group before and after intervention.\n【462】 # Outcomes of interest\n【463】 Injury rates (especially falls), well-being and quality of life, mental health and depression, dependency on external social or care services, and social participation.\n【464】 # Time stamp\n【465】 Current systematic review on the association between accessible home environments and the health of people with impairments included studies published up to April 2018. guidelines, the introductory paragraphs, which outline the current health burden of each risk factor rely on other sources and have been drafted for the purpose of these guidelines.\n【466】 Water is a physiological requirement to sustain adequate hydration, to prepare food, and to maintain hygiene. Contaminated water transmits infectious disease and sometimes non-infectious disease such as lead poisoning from leaded pipes and plumbing. Lack of access to sufficient water discourages hygiene practices. Water can be contaminated by microbes and chemicals at its source, in its storage, and in its transportation, whether by handheld vessels, tankers or distribution pipes. It is important to ensure that drinking-water supply is reliable, that it is protected from contamination by waste water, and that pipes and storage systems are correctly installed and maintained .\n【467】 Everyone has the right to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, such as for drinking and for hygiene . However, in 2015, 844 million people lacked even a basic drinking-water service, including 159 million dependent on surface water. Only eight out of ten people could use improved sources with water available when . At least 1.8 billion people use a drinking-water source contaminated with faeces . Climate change, increasing water scarcity, population growth, demographic changes and urbanization pose challenges for water supply systems. By 2050, 40% of the world's population will be living in river basins experiencing severe water-stress .\n【468】 Unsafe water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea illnesses, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio, and lead poisoning from lead drinking-water service lines, or leaded solder, or brass or leaded fixtures. Diarrhoeal disease alone amounts to an estimated 3.6% of the total DALY global burden of disease and is responsible for the deaths of 1.5 million people every year. It is estimated that 58% of that burden, or 842 000 deaths per year, is attributable to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene, mostly in low-and middle-income countries . With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health and therefore better school attendance .\n【469】 # WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality\n【470】 Threshold values for water contaminants in drinking-water are available in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality (fourth edition published in 2011 and complemented by the first addendum in  . 6 WHO documents related to water management in buildings and other aspects of WASH provide more technical guidance on implementation and are listed at the end of this section.\n【471】 Guideline values related to drinking-water contamination  Chemical contaminants: The selected chemical contaminants displayed in 1 are associated with potential contamination through pipes and plumbing components and therefore are considered relevant from a building perspective.\n【472】 # Compound Guideline value\n【473】 Antimony 0.02 mg/l (20 µg/l) As the most common source of antimony in drinking-water appears to be dissolution from metal plumbing and fittings, control of antimony from such sources would be by product control.\n【474】 Benzopyrene 0.0007 mg/l (0.7 µg/l) The presence of significant concentrations of benzopyrene in drinking-water in the absence of very high concentrations of fluoranthene indicates the presence of coal tar particles, which may arise from seriously deteriorating coal tar pipe linings.\n【475】 It is recommended that the use of coal tar based and similar materials for pipe linings and coatings on storage tanks be discontinued.\n【476】 Copper 2 mg/l (2000 µg/l) In most instances where copper tubing is used as a plumbing material, concentrations of copper will be below the guideline value. However, there are some conditions, such as highly acidic or aggressive waters, that will give rise to much higher copper concentrations, and the use of copper tubing may not be appropriate in such circumstances.\n【477】 Lead 0.01 mg/l (10 µg/l) This is a provisional guideline value as the key effects of lead seem not to have a threshold. Lead is exceptional compared with other chemical hazards, in that most lead in drinking-water arises from plumbing in buildings, and the remedy consists principally of removing plumbing and fittings containing lead. All other practical measures to reduce total exposure to lead, including corrosion control, should be implemented.\n【478】 Nickel 0.07 mg/l (70 µg/l) Where nickel leaches from alloys in contact with drinking-water or from chromium-or nickel-plated taps, control is by appropriate control of materials in contact with the drinking-water and flushing taps before using the water.\n【479】 Vinyl chloride 0.0003 mg/l (0.3 µg/l) As vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen, exposure to this compound should be avoided as far as practicable, and levels should be kept as low as technically feasible. Vinyl chloride is primarily of concern as a potential contaminant from some grades of polyvinyl chloride pipe and is best controlled by specification of material quality. The selected chemical contaminants displayed in 2 are of greatest health concern in some natural waters, and may pose significant health risks in non-piped water supply conditions.\n【480】 Guideline value Arsenic 0.01 mg/l (10 µg/l) The guideline value is designated as provisional on the basis of treatment performance and analytical achievability.\n【481】 Arsenic is usually present in natural waters at concentrations of less than 1-2 µg/l. However, in waters, particularly groundwaters, where there are sulfide mineral deposits and sedimentary deposits deriving from volcanic rocks, the concentrations can be significantly elevated. Signs of chronic arsenicism, including dermal lesions, such as hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, peripheral neuropathy, skin cancer, bladder and lung cancers and peripheral vascular disease, have been observed in populations ingesting arsenic-contaminated drinking-water. For local non-piped water supplies, the first option for control is often substitution by, or dilution with, microbially safe low-arsenic sources. It may  be appropriate to use alternative sources for drinking and cooking but to use the contaminated sources for purposes such as washing and laundry.\n【482】 Fluoride 1.5 mg/l (1500 µg/l) Traces of fluorides are present in many waters, with higher concentrations often associated with groundwaters. Skeletal fluorosis (with adverse changes in bone structure) may be observed when drinking-water contains 3-6 mg/l fluoride, particularly with high water consumption. Crippling skeletal fluorosis usually develops only where drinking-water contains over 10 mg/l. The risk of dental fluorosis will depend on the total intake of fluoride from all sources and not just the concentration in drinking-water. A management guidance document on fluoride is available. In some countries, fluoride may  be added to drinkingwater in order to provide protection against dental caries, such that final concentrations are usually between 0.5 and 1 mg/l. Nitrate 50 mg/l (50 000 µg/l) Methaemoglobinaemia has most frequently been associated with private wells. The most appropriate means of controlling nitrate concentrations, particularly in groundwater, is the prevention of contamination. This may take the form of appropriate management of agricultural practices, the careful siting of pit latrines and septic tanks, sewer leakage control, as well as management of fertilizer and manure application and storage of animal manures. It may  take the form of denitrification of wastewater effluents.\n【483】 # Escherichia coli\n【484】 Escherichia coli (E. coli) or thermotolerant coliform bacteria must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. The presence of E. coli indicates faecal contamination of drinking-water due to cross-contamination. Such cross-contamination may occur in buildings due to cross-connection with non-drinking-water systems or during water transport or storage in non-piped water supply conditions where households need to fetch water at a source outside their home.\n【485】 # 3 WHO guideline values for drinking-water quality: bacteria\n【486】 Guidelines related to quantity and continuity of drinking-water supply 7 Access to drinking-water should be optimal. Interventions to increase levels of water service and supply should be prioritized as follows: Interruptions to drinking-water supply, either because of intermittent sources or resulting from engineering inefficiencies, are a major determinant of the access to and quality of drinking-water.\n【487】 These values included in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality refer to the WHO publication on Domestic water quantity, service level and health. This latter is being updated and new reference values will be ready during 2018.\n【488】 # Guidelines related to water collection and transport\n【489】 Maintaining the quality of water during collection and manual transport is the responsibility of the household. Good hygiene practices are required and should be supported through hygiene education. Hygiene education programmes should provide households and communities with skills to monitor and manage their water hygiene.\n【490】 In many low-and middle-income countries, consumers purchase water from kiosks and then carry the water home in a variety of containers of varying size. Measures should be taken to protect vended water from contamination during transport, as well as during storage in the home. These measures include transporting and storing water in containers that are clean, free from both faecal and chemical contamination, and either enclosed, or with narrow openings, and ideally fitted with a dispensing device such as a spigot that prevents hand access and other sources of extraneous contamination. Good hygiene is required and should be supported by educational programmes.\n【491】 In other cases, particularly in low-income countries, vendors transport and deliver the water to users in tanker trucks. If large volumes are being transported, the addition of chlorine to provide a free residual concentration of at least 0.5 mg/l at the point of delivery to users is desirable. Tankers should  be used solely for water or, if this is not possible, should be thoroughly cleaned prior to use.\n【492】 # Guidelines related to plumbing\n【493】 Significant adverse health effects have been associated with inadequate plumbing systems within public and private buildings arising from poor design, incorrect installation, alterations and inadequate maintenance.\n【494】 Numerous factors influence the quality of water within a building's piped distribution system and may result in microbial or chemical contamination of drinking-water. Outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease can occur through faecal contamination of drinking-water within buildings arising from deficiencies in roof storage tanks and cross-connections with wastewater pipes, for example. Poorly designed plumbing systems can cause stagnation of water and provide a suitable environment for the proliferation of Legionella.\n【495】 Plumbing materials, pipes, fittings and coatings can result in elevated heavy metal (e.g. lead) concentrations in drinking-water, and inappropriate materials can be conducive to bacterial growth. Potential adverse health effects may not be confined to the individual building. Exposure of other consumers to contaminants is possible through contamination of the local public distribution system, beyond the particular building, through crosscontamination of drinking-water and backflow.\n【496】 The delivery of water that complies with relevant standards within buildings generally relies on a plumbing system that is not directly managed by the water supplier. Reliance is therefore placed on proper installation of plumbing and, for larger buildings, on building-specific water safety plans (WSPs).\n【497】 To ensure the safety of drinking-water supplies within the building system, plumbing practices must prevent the introduction of hazards to health. This can be achieved by ensuring that:\n【498】 - pipes carrying either water or wastes are watertight, durable, of smooth and unobstructed interior and protected against anticipated stresses;\n【499】 - cross-connections between the drinking-water supply and the wastewater removal systems do not occur;\n【500】 - roof storage systems are intact and not subject to intrusion of microbial or chemical contaminants;\n【501】 - hot and cold water systems are designed to minimize the proliferation of Legionella; - appropriate protection is in place to prevent backflow;\n【502】 - the system design of multistorey buildings minimizes pressure fluctuations;\n【503】 - waste is discharged without contaminating drinking-water;\n【504】 - plumbing systems function efficiently.\n【505】 It is important that plumbers are appropriately qualified, have the competence to undertake necessary servicing of plumbing systems to ensure compliance with local regulations and use only materials approved as safe for use with drinking-water.\n【506】 Design of the plumbing systems of new buildings should normally be approved prior to construction and be inspected by an appropriate regulatory body during construction and prior to commissioning of the buildings.\n", "seq_id": 3139, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#269#269#接上一行", "type3": "无关文本#23#24#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#67#69#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#91#91#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#172#172#5内容与文本无关\n无关文本#216#216#最后1句与文本无关\n无关文本#217#217#内容与文本无关\n无关文本#424#424#最后两句与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 19:50:42"}

It wasn't until 5 years later on April 16th, 1943, that the psychedelic properties were discovered.\n【2】 # History\n【3】 The Sandoz laboratory had undertaken a research program aimed at isolating the active constituents of medicinal plants so that they could be produced in the laboratory and later precisely dosed for accurate administration to patients. Dr. Hofmann eventually began researching the ergot fungus and alkaloids which could be derived from it. Ergot was traditionally used by midwives as an ecbolic, a medication used to induce childbirth, and early 20th century research indicated that the various compounds in ergot had other effects on the body as well, prompting further research.\n【4】 After Dr. Hofmann succeeded in synthesizing ergobasine (which became the preeminent uterotonic), he began experiments with other molecules based around the central lysergic acid component shared by ergot alkalines. Lysergic acid diethylamide, the 25th lysergic acid derivative he synthesised (hence the name LSD- was developed initially as a probable analeptic, a circulatory and respiratory stimulant, based on its structural similarity to another known analeptic, nikethamide (nicotinic acid diethylamide). However, no extraordinary benefits of the compound were identified during animal tests (though laboratory notes briefly mention that the animals became \"restless\" under its effects), and its study was discontinued.\n【5】 ## Bicycle Day\n【6】 The psychedelic effects of LSD were unknown for the next five years. Dr. Hofmann writes in LSD: My Problem Child that a \"peculiar presentiment\" prompted him to revisit LSD-25. While re-synthesizing the compound for further study, he became dizzy and was forced to stop work:\n【7】 Last Friday, April 16, 1943, I was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away.\n【8】 Three days later, on April 19, 1943 (known as Bicycle Day), Dr. Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 µg of LSD, which he hypothesized would be a threshold dose, based on other ergot alkaloids.  In reality, this is a fairly substantial dose and the threshold would actually be around 25 µg. Hoffman wrote:\n【9】 By now it was already clear to me that LSD had been the cause of the remarkable experience of the previous Friday, for the altered perceptions were of the same type as before, only much more intense. I had to struggle to speak intelligibly. I asked my laboratory assistant, who was informed of the self-experiment, to escort me home. We went by bicycle, no automobile being available because of wartime restrictions on their use. On the way home, my condition began to assume threatening forms. Everything in my field of vision wavered and was distorted as if seen in a curved mirror. I  had the sensation of being unable to move from the spot. Nevertheless, my assistant later told me we had traveled very rapidly.\n【10】 Dr. Hofmann summoned a doctor, who could find no abnormal physical symptoms other than extremely dilated pupils. After spending several hours terrified that his body had been possessed by a demon, that his next door neighbour was a witch, and that his furniture was threatening him, that Albert Einstein was chasing him with a kitchen knife, Dr. Hofmann feared he had become completely insane.\n【11】 saw no reason to prescribe any medication. Instead he conveyed me to my bed and stood watch over me. Slowly I came back from a weird, unfamiliar world to reassuring everyday reality. The horror softened and gave way to a feeling of good fortune and gratitude, the more normal perceptions and thoughts returned, and I became more confident that the danger of insanity was conclusively past.\n【12】 Now, little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux. It was particularly remarkable how every acoustic perception, such as the sound of a door handle or a passing automobile, became transformed into optical perceptions. Every sound generated a vividly changing image, with its own consistent form and color\n【13】 Exhausted, I then slept, to awake next morning refreshed, with a clear head, though still somewhat tired physically. A sensation of well-being and renewed life flowed through me. Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinary pleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in which the sun shone now after a spring rain, everything glistened and sparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created. All my senses vibrated in a condition of highest sensitivity, which then persisted for the entire day.\n【14】 This self-experiment showed that LSD-25 behaved as a psychoactive substance with extraordinary properties and potency. There was to my knowledge no other known substance that evoked such profound psychic effects in such extremely low doses, that caused such dramatic changes in human consciousness and our experience of the inner and outer world.\n【15】 Interest in the drug was revived after Dr. Hofmann's experiment, and the University of Zurich began conducting systematic human trials on both normal participants and psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. In both cases, the predominant reaction was euphoria. Sandoz began producing LSD under the trade name Delysid for research, suggesting that the drug might be useful \"to elicit release of repressed material and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxiety states and obsessional neuroses\" and  for self-experimentation by psychiatrists, \"to gain an insight into the world of ideas and sensations of mental patients\".\n【16】 # Psychiatric use\n【17】 LSD was introduced into the United States in 1948. Sandoz Laboratories marketed LSD as a psychiatric cure-all and hailed it as a remedy for everything from schizophrenia to criminal behavior, sexual perversions, and alcoholism. In psychiatry, the use of LSD by students was an accepted practice; it was viewed as a teaching tool in an attempt to enable the psychiatrist to subjectively understand schizophrenia. It was  showed great promise as a facilitating agent in psychedelic psychotherapy. In one study in the late 1950s, Dr Humphry Osmond gave LSD to alcoholics in Alcoholics Anonymous who had failed to quit drinking. After one year, around 50% of the study group had not had a drink — a success rate that has never been duplicated by any other means.\n【18】 In the United Kingdom the use of LSD was pioneered by Dr Ronald Sandison in 1952, at Powick Hospital, Worcestershire. A special LSD unit was set up in 1958. After Dr Sandison left the hospital in 1964, medical superintendent Dr Arthur Spencer took over and used the drug until he retired in 1972. In all, 683 patients were treated with LSD in 13,785 separate sessions at Powick, but Dr Spencer was the last member of the medical staff to use it.\n【19】 From the late 1940s through the mid-1970s, extensive research and testing were conducted on LSD. During a 15-year period beginning in 1950, research on LSD and other hallucinogens generated over 1000 scientific papers, several dozen books, and 6 international conferences, and LSD was prescribed as treatment to over 40,000 patients. Film star Cary Grant was one of many men during the '50s and '60s who were given LSD in concert with psychotherapy, in an effort to overcome 'homosexual tendencies'.  Many psychiatrists began taking the drug recreationally and sharing it with friends. Dr. Leary's experiments  History of LSD below) spread LSD usage to a much wider segment of the general populace.\n【20】 Sandoz halted LSD production in August of 1965 after growing governmental protests at its proliferation among the general populace. The National Institute of Mental Health in the United States distributed LSD on a limited basis for scientific research. Scientific study of LSD largely ceased circa 1980 as research funding declined, and governments became wary of permitting such research, fearing that the results of the research might encourage illicit LSD use. By the end of the century there were few authorized researchers left, and their efforts were mostly directed towards establishing approved protocols for further work with LSD in easing the suffering of the dying ( thanatotherapy) and with drug addicts and alcoholics.\n【21】 # Resistance and prohibition\n【22】 By the mid-sixties the backlash against the use of LSD and its perceived corrosive effects on the values of the Western middle class resulted in governmental action to restrict the availability of the drug by making any use of it illegal. Despite a history of positive results of judicious use under controlled circumstances, LSD was declared a \"Schedule 1\", even though this entails that the drug has a \"high potential for abuse\" and is without any \"currently accepted medical use in treatment\".  LSD was removed from legal circulation. To support this action, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency claimed:\n【23】 Although initial observations on the benefits of LSD were highly optimistic, empirical data developed subsequently proved less promising  Its use in scientific research has been extensive and its use has been widespread.  Although the study of LSD and other hallucinogens increased the awareness of how chemicals could affect the mind, its use in psychotherapy largely has been debunked.  It produces no aphrodisiac effects, does not increase creativity, has no lasting positive effect in treating alcoholics or criminals, does not produce a 'model psychosis', and does not generate immediate personality change.\n【24】 However, drug studies have confirmed that the powerful hallucinogenic effects of this drug can produce profound adverse reactions, such as acute panic reactions, psychotic crises, and \"flashbacks\", especially in users ill-equipped to deal with such trauma.\n【25】 They fail to mention that these \"adverse reactions\" are almost exclusively the result of a \"psychedelic\" dose, ~400μg or more (typical dose is around 50-150μg). The  set and setting can act as a catalyst for the mentioned negative experiences, as indeed with the positive.\n【26】 As always with psychedelics, the rule is:  There are no bad trips, only bad people.\n【27】 # Aldous Huxley\n【28】 Renowned British intellectual Aldous Huxley was one of the most important figures in the early history of LSD. He was a figure of high repute in the world of letters and had become internationally famous through his novels Crome Yellow, Antic Hay and his dystopian novel Brave New World. His experiments with psychedelic drugs (initially mescaline) and his descriptions of them in his writings did much to spread awareness of psychedelic drugs to the general public and arguably helped to glamorize their recreational use, although Huxley himself treated them very seriously.\n【29】 Huxley was introduced to psychedelic drugs by a friend, psychiatrist Dr. Humphry Osmond. Osmond had become interested in hallucinogens and their relationship to mental illness in the 1940s and during the 1950s he made extensive studies of a number of drugs including mescaline and LSD. As noted above, Osmond had some remarkable success in treating alcoholics with LSD.\n【30】 In May 1953 Osmond gave Huxley his first dose of mescaline, at the Huxley home. Huxley subsequently recorded his experiences in the landmark book The Doors of Perception; the title was drawn from a quotation by British artist and poet William Blake, and Huxley's book in turn was the source of the name of American rock band The Doors. Huxley tried LSD for the first time in 1955, obtained from \"Captain\" Al Hubbard.\n【31】 Hubbard is a remarkable and controversial figure in his own right and is almost equally important to the history of LSD as Huxley or Leary. Hubbard had become a 'freelance' apostle for LSD in the early 1950s after supposedly receiving an angelic vision telling him that something important to the future of mankind would soon be coming. When he read about LSD the next year, he immediately sought and acquired LSD, which he tried for himself in 1951.\n【32】 Although he had no medical training, during the Fifties Hubbard worked at Vancouver's Hollywood Hospital with Ross McLean, with psychiatrists Abram Hoffer and Dr. Humphry Osmond, with Myron Stolaroff at the International Federation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, and with Willis Harman at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) running psychedelic sessions with LSD.\n【33】 At various times over the next twenty years, Hubbard  reportedly worked for the Canadian Special Services, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms. It is  rumoured that he was involved with the CIA's MK-ULTRA project. How his government positions interacted with his work with LSD is unknown.\n【34】 Hubbard is reputed to have introduced more than 6,000 people to LSD, including scientists, politicians, intelligence officials, diplomats, and church figures. He became known as the original \"Captain Trips\", travelling about with a leather case containing pharmaceutically pure LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin.\n【35】 # Dr. Timothy Leary\n【36】 A significant number of researchers disagreed with the government's assessment of LSD. Dr. Timothy Leary, a psychology professor at Harvard University, was the most prominent pro-LSD researcher. Leary claimed that using LSD with the right dosage, set (what one brings to the experience), and setting, preferably with the guidance of professionals, could alter behaviour in dramatic and beneficial ways.\n【37】 Dr. Leary began conducting experiments with psilocybin in 1960 on himself and a number of Harvard graduate students after trying hallucinogenic mushrooms used in Native American religious rituals while visiting Mexico. His group began conducting experiments on state prisoners, where they claimed a 90% success rate preventing repeat offences. A student introduced Leary to LSD, and he then incorporated that drug into his research as his mental catalyst of choice. His experiments produced no murders, suicides, psychotic breaks, or bad trips. On the contrary, almost all of Leary's participants reported profound mystical experiences which they felt had a tremendous positive effect on their lives.\n【38】 By 1962, faculty discontent with Leary's experiments reached critical mass. Leary was informed that the CIA was monitoring his research  Government experiments below). Many of the other faculty members had harboured reservations about Leary's research, and powerful parents began complaining to the university about Leary's distribution of hallucinogenic drugs to their children. Further, many undergraduate students who were not part of Leary's research program heard of the profound experiences other students had undergone, and began taking LSD (which was not illegal at the time) recreationally. Leary described LSD as a potent aphrodisiac in an interview with Playboy magazine. Leary and another professor, Richard Alpert, were dismissed from the university in 1963.\n【39】 Leary and Alpert, unfazed by their dismissals, relocated first to Mexico, but were expelled from the country by the Mexican government. They then set up at a large private mansion owned by William Hitchcock in New York, known as Millbrook, where they continued their experiments. Their research lost its controlled scientific character as the experiments transformed into LSD parties. Leary later wrote, \"We saw ourselves as anthropologists from the twenty-first century inhabiting a time module set somewhere in the Dark Ages of the 1960s. On this space colony we were attempting to create a new paganism and a new dedication to life as art.\"\n【40】 A judge who expressed dislike for Dr. Leary's books sentenced him to 30 years in prison for possession of half a marijuana cigarette (which was later reversed by the Supreme Court in Leary v. United States). Publicity surrounding the case further cemented Leary's growing reputation as a counter cultural guru. Around this time, President Richard Nixon described Leary as \"the most dangerous man in America.\" Repeated FBI raids instigated the end of the Millbrook experiment. Leary refocused his efforts towards countering the tremendous amount of anti-LSD propaganda then being issued by the United States government, coining the slogan, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out.\"\n【41】 Many experts blame Leary and his antics for the near-total suppression of psychedelic research over the last thirty five years .\n【42】 # Government experiments\n【43】 LSD was the original centerpiece of the United States Central Intelligence Agency's top secret MK-ULTRA project, an ambitious undertaking conducted from the 1950s through the 1970s designed to explore the possibilities of pharmaceutical mind control. Hundreds of participants, including CIA agents, government employees, military personnel, prostitutes, members of the general public, and mental patients were given LSD, many without their knowledge or consent. The experiments often involved severe psychological torture, and many victims committed suicide or wound up in psychiatric wards. The researchers eventually concluded that LSD's effects were too varied and uncontrollable to make it of any practical use as a truth drug, and the project moved on to other substances. It would be decades before the US government admitted the existence of the project and offered apologies to the families of those who had died during the experiments.\n【44】 The role of 'middle-men' like Al Hubbard  above) is still little understood and it is likely to be many decades (if ever) before information about their activities is declassified. The precise relationships between government projects like MK-ULTRA and academic research is not yet known, but it is highly probable that agencies such as the American CIA were closely monitoring non-government research in this area. Hubbard is known to have had direct connections to several medical programs during the 1950s, gave LSD to thousands of people, and is known to have worked (possibly simultaneously) for a number of Canadian and American government agencies.\n【45】 Although the subject is highly contentious, there are those who argue that, whilst LSD eventually proved too unpredictable to be useful as a chemical weapon, it may have found another intelligence use. It is claimed that government agencies such as the CIA may have covertly promoted LSD among American youth, seeing it as a means of undermining and destabilising the emerging alternative / underground culture and the growing anti-war movement.\n【46】 It is  interesting to compare the fates of high-profile LSD advocate Timothy Leary and that of the notorious but elusive LSD chemist Augustus Owsley Stanley III. Leary was hounded by the police, the FBI and possibly  the CIA and was given a draconian prison sentence for possession of a minuscule amount of marijuana. It is generally accepted that much of the best 'street' LSD that circulated in the western United States and beyond in the late 1960s was manufactured by Owsley, who was immortalized in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.\n【47】 When he was apprehended by police in California in late 1967, Owsley was reportedly found in possession of enough LSD to make at least 250,000 trips; notwithstanding his reputation as the world's top illicit LSD chemist, he attempted to argue that this huge quantity was for personal use.  After being found guilty, Owsley was given a relatively light sentence of two years, and despite his international reputation and his criminal record, he was subsequently allowed to emigrate to Australia.\n【48】 There have  been persistent claims of connections between the CIA and members of the so-called \"Brotherhood of Eternal Love\", most focusing on the mysterious figure of Ronald Stark, a reputed criminal who was alleged to have links to both the CIA and to paramilitary organizations including the PLO, as well as allegedly overseeing one of the world's largest LSD manufacturing and distribution rings, which operated in Italy, France and Belgium.\n【49】 Though no evidence has yet come to light in the West, it is presumed likely that the Soviet government conducted its own experiments on the properties of LSD during the Cold War.\n【50】 # Recreational use\n【51】 LSD began to be used recreationally in certain (primarily medical) circles. Some psychiatric and medical professionals, acquainted with LSD in their work, began using it themselves and sharing it with friends and associates. Among the first to do so was British psychiatrist Humphry Osmond, who first gave the drug to author Aldous Huxley and who coined the term \"psychedelic\" to describe its effects.\n【52】 LSD historian Jay Stevens, author of the book Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream, has said that, in the early days of its recreational use, LSD users (who were at that time mostly academics and medical professional people) fell into two broadly delineated groups. The first group, which was essentially conservative and was exemplified by Huxley, felt that LSD was too powerful and too dangerous to allow its immediate and widespread introduction, and that its use ought to be restricted to the 'elite' members of society — artists, writers, scientists — who could mediate its gradual distribution throughout society. The second and more radical group, typified by Alpert and Leary, felt that LSD had the power to revolutionize society and that it should be spread as widely as possible and be available to all.\n【53】 During the 1960s, this second 'group' of casual LSD users evolved and expanded into a subculture that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising consciousness. The personalities associated with the subculture, gurus such as Dr. Timothy Leary and psychedelic rock musicians such as the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.\n【54】 The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as Ken Kesey participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of these early days of LSD's entrance into the non-academic world in his book The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which documented the cross country, acid-fueled voyage of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus \"Furthur\" and the Pranksters' later experimentation with group use of LSD at the so-called Acid Tests.\n【55】 LSD became a headline item in early 1967, largely thanks to The Beatles. Paul McCartney made highly publicized admissions about his and the group's LSD use in press and TV interviews; earlier in the year, British tabloid News of the World ran a sensational three-week series which claimed to blow the lid on 'drug parties' hosted by rock group The Moody Blues and attended by leading stars including Donovan, The Who's Pete Townshend and Cream drummer Ginger Baker. Largely as a result of collusion between News of the World journalists and the London Drug Squad, many pop stars including Donovan, and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones were busted for drug possession, although none of the arrests involved LSD.  The first ever home grown UK 'acid lab' that got busted was in 1969 — up to then all LSD had been imported from the U.S., or was remnant produce of Sandoz before it stopped producing LSD. The lab, in Kent, and a flat in London were raided simultaneously and quantities of equipment and LSD seized along with the two men who had been making the LSD; Quentin Theobald and Peter Simmons.\n【56】 The music of groups including The Beatles had  begun to show the obvious influence of their experiences with LSD. John Lennon wrote a song which many assumed referred to LSD, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", although John Lennon always dismissed the connection as coincidence; the source of the title (which has been confirmed by others in the group) was Lennon's son Julian, who described the subject of a drawing he had made of a school friend (one Lucy O'Donnell).  Lennon and Harrison, however, had been experimenting with the drug since early 1966 — they were given their first trips by their dentist at a party. The songs \"She Said She Said\" (the line,'I know what it's like to be dead' is from an LSD trip the Beatles took with actor Peter Fonda. Fonda said those words repeatedly to John Lennon during the acid trip) and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (many lines of which Lennon borrowed from Leary's \"The Psychedelic Experience\") from the album Revolver were clearly about LSD trips.  During that same time, bands such as Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead helped give birth to a genre known as \"psychedelic rock\" or acid rock.\n【57】 LSD was evidently in limited recreational use in Australia in the early 1960s, but is believed to have been  initially restricted to those with connections to the scientific and the medical communities. LSD overdose was suggested as a possible cause in the still-unsolved deaths of CSIRO scientists Dr Gilbert Bogle and his lover Dr Margaret Chandler, whose naked bodies were found beside the Lane Cove River in Sydney after a New Year's Eve party in on January 1, 1963.\n【58】 Large quantities of LSD began to appear in Australia around 1967, and soon permated the music scene and youth culture in general, especially in the capital cities. The major source of supply during this period is believed to have been American servicemen visiting Australia (mainly Sydney) from Vietnam on 'rest and recreation' (R&R) leave, although the growing connections between American and Australian organized crime in the late 1960s may  have facilitated its importation. Recreational LSD use among young people was on a par with that in other countries in Australia by the early 1970s and continued until late in the decade. LSD is not believed to have been manufactured locally in a significant quantity (if at all) and most if not all supplies were sourced from overseas.\n【59】 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the drug culture adopted LSD as the psychedelic drug of choice, particularly amongst the hippie community. However, LSD dramatically decreased in popularity in the mid-1970s. This decline was due to negative publicity centred on side-effects of LSD use (most misleading or patently false), its criminalization, and the increasing effectiveness of drug law enforcement efforts, rather than new medical information. The last country to produce LSD legally (until  was Czechoslovakia; during the 1960s, high-quality LSD was imported from the communist country to California, a fact appreciated by Leary in The Politics of Ecstasy.\n【60】 The availability of LSD had been drastically reduced by the late 1970s due to a combination of governmental controls and law enforcement. The supply of constituent chemicals (notably ergotamine tartrate) were placed under tight surveillance and government funding for LSD research was almost totally eliminated. These efforts were augmented by a series of major busts in England and Europe. One of the most famous was \"Operation Julie\" in Britain in 1978; it broke up one of the largest LSD manufacturing and distribution operations in the world at that time, headed by chemist Richard Kemp. The group targeted by the Julie task force were reputed to have had links to the mysterious Brotherhood of Eternal Love and to Ronald Stark.\n【61】 The fifteen defendants included two highly qualified chemists, two doctors of medicine, a teacher, and the American author David Solomon, a friend to Timothy Leary and a reputed \"walking encyclopaedia\" of drugs culture. The defendants were caught by a lengthy operation that involved police officers — one of them named Julie — who posed as hippies in the Welsh hills and on London council estates. They eventually located two large 'acid factories' in a farmhouse near Tregaron in West Wales and in a house in Hampton Wick. One of the police who raided the London factory reportedly ignored warnings from the occupants about a large amount of LSD that had been spilled in the room, and had to be hospitalized after absorbing the volatile chemical through skin contact.\n【62】 Several of the conspirators were reputed to have made more than £1 million each and on their arrest  they joked with detectives that their business acumen merited a Queen's Award for Exports. Kemp had allegedly become convinced that LSD could \"liberate\" people's minds and assist harmonious social relationships and it was claimed at the time of his arrest that Kemp and his associates had stockpiled enough LSD to make millions of trips.\n【63】 As a recreational drug, LSD has remained popular among certain segments of society. Traditionally, it has been popular with high school and college students and other young adults. LSD  has been integral to the lifestyle of many individuals who follow certain rock music bands, most notably the Grateful Dead. Older individuals, introduced to the hallucinogen in the 1960s,  still use LSD.\n【64】 LSD made a comeback in the 1990s, especially through the acid house scene and raver subculture.  However, the current average dosage unit is approximately 30 to 75 micrograms, a significant decrease from the 1960 average dosage unit of 200 to 300 micrograms. Lower doses may account for the relatively few LSD-related psychiatric emergencies during this period. LSD use and availability declined sharply following a raid of a large scale LSD lab in 2000  LSD in the United States).\n【65】 Although retail-level distribution of LSD is known to sometimes take place at public events that feature music that appeals to users, such as certain kinds of concerts and all-night raves, users at the fringes of the distribution chain typically obtain small quantities of LSD from friends and acquaintances in relatively private exchanges.\n", "seq_id": 23282, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#22#22#“Schedule 1”内容与文本无关", "type4": "语义不完整#8#8#Hoffman wrote:没表述完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-18 22:29:58"}

The RACGP has the largest general practitioner membership of any medical organisation in Australia, with the majority of Australia's general practitioners belonging to their professional college. Over 22,000 general practitioners are members of the RACGP Continuing Professional Development Program. The RACGP National Rural Faculty, representing more than 5000 members, has the largest rural general practitioner membership of any medical organisation in Australia.\n【3】 # History of General Practice in Australia and beyond\n【4】 Prior to the mid 20th century, upon graduation Australian doctors spent time in general practice. The common passage of a medical career comprised of most doctors completing an intern year immediately post graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After a period of time in general practice, some doctors would seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these doctors would travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise and then return to establish practice.\n【5】 As the Australian population grew post World War II, the public hospital system  grew demanding an increasing number of specialists. Local training program emerged and therefore the ability of a doctor to enter specialist training directly following the mandatory intern year post graduation without entering general practice. This increasing number of specialist made it increasingly difficult to general practitioners in Australia to hold and retain public hospital appointments, especially in procedural areas such as surgery or obstetrics.\n【6】 This was not a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Worldwide, medical practice was shifting focus onto hospitals with the expansion of pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical interventions. In the United States, the number of doctors identifying as General Practitioners fell markedly between 1931 and 1974 from 83% to 18%. This process began as specialisation increased prior to the War. US GPs increasingly felt that health care was becoming fragmented and weakening doctor patient relationships.\n【7】 “There are 57 different varieties of specialist to diagnose and treat 57 different varieties of disease but no physician to take care of the patient.\"\n【8】 ## Development of Professional Colleges\n【9】 This led to the creation of the American Academy of General Practice (later Family Physicians) in 1947.\n【10】 Similarly, in the UK, the increasing specialisation and cost of healthcare, saw the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS), designed to have GPs act as the ‘gatekeepers’ providing primary care to all patients registered on their ‘list’ and referring as appropriate to gain access to specialist care and other benefits under the UK’s socialised heath system. The UK experience is notably through the contribution and involvement of many influential and effective Australians in defining the problems of general practice and the need for a professional and academic basis to the craft group.\n【11】 In 1950, an Australian Graduate, Dr Joseph Collings, conducted a review of general practice in the UK. This 30 page report was published in the Lancet in 1950.\n【12】 “There are no real standards for general practice. What a doctor does and how he does it depends entirely on his own conscience” Dr Collings, 1950.\n【13】 Dr Collings’ report was scathing and generated immediate and heated interest. It was undoubtably a key event in the definition of general practice as a speciality.\n【14】 He identified that general practice has no academic underpinning, no evidence upon which to base practice and no consistency of practice. The report did not pull punches. He described rural practice is “an anachronism”, suburban practice is a “casualty-clearing” service and Inner city practice is “at best… very unsatisfactory and at worst a positive source of public danger.”\n【15】 There is a direct link between the public criticism of general practice and the move to create a College. Dr Rose and Dr Hunt in the BMJ 1950 write:\n【16】 “There is a College of Physicians, a College of Surgeons, a College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, a College of Nursing, a College of Midwives and a college of Veterinary Surgeons, all of them Royal Colleges; there is a College of Speech Therapists and a College of Physical Education, but there is no college or academic body to represent primarily the interests of the largest group of medical personnel in this country – the 20,000 general practitioners.”\n【17】 Interestingly, there was opposition in the UK to the creation of a College by the existing three Medical Colleges – Colleges of Surgeons, Physicians and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists – who held the belief that general practice should be a joint faculty of general practice linked to the existing Colleges. However, put into perspective, in the same document Hunt describes the two original British Colleges sought to stop the creation of the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists via legal action in 1929.\n【18】 ## The Development of the Australian College of General Practitioners\n【19】 The British College of General Practitioners was formed in 1953 with many Australian doctors amongst the founding members including the RACGP’s first president Dr William Connelly. Dr Connelly, again reflecting the origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, established a New South Wales faculty of the BCGP. This was followed by the creation of other state based faculties of the British College of General Practitioners in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia over the next 5 years.\n【20】 In keeping with the process for creating Medical Colleges under the British system, a group of Australian General Practitioners met in 1957 at the first Annual Scientific Convention in Sydney to declare an intention to form the Australian College of General Practitioners (ACGP) which was formally founded in 1958. This new College joined the state based faculties. State based faculties remain a key part of the modern day function of the RACGP.\n【21】 ### The Objectives of the Australian College of General Practitioners\n【22】 This College established the following objectives:\n【23】 - To promote a scientific approach to problems of disease at the level of the individual and the family;\n【24】 - To promote the prevention of disease and guard the nation’s health and the welfare of the community by every means available to the general practitioner;\n【25】 - To foster and maintain high standards of general practice;\n【26】 - To encourage and assist young men and women in preparing for, qualifying in and establishing themselves in general practice;\n【27】 - To stimulate postgraduate education of general practitioners by providing facilities applicable to general practice; and\n【28】 - To conduct clinical research into conditions most frequently seen and appropriately studied in general practice.\n【29】 ## Recognition of General Practice as a medical specialty\n【30】 In modern Australia, General Practice is listed by the AMC as a medical specialty and the RACGP as the specialist college responsible for assessment. Yet, on further examination of how general practice is considered across the nation, some State-based Medical Practitioners’ Boards such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, do not consider general practice a medical specialty and general practice qualifications, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (FRACGP) are not registrable qualifications.\n【31】 The oddity of general practice in Australia is a lingering and arguably outdated perception that the decision to practise as a GP has low or no standing and status. Comments heard by many GPs including; ‘You are just a GP’ or ‘What do you intend on specialising in?’ reflect something of the community understanding of the General Practitioner.\n【32】 This is not without precedent. The history of the General Practitioner shows that GPs in early Australia through to GPs in mid and late 20th century, ‘defaulted’ into general practice having disliked surgical or physician training or having failed exit exams too often.\n【33】 Also, while Australian General Practitioners were part of the creation of the Royal College of General Practitioners and instrumental in highlighting the need for professional and practice standards, Australia was one of the last developed countries to recognise general practice as a specialty. It was 1978 before the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee (the predecessor to the Australian Medical Council) recognised general practice as a specialty. In contrast, The United Kingdom had a powerful case for recognition by the late 1960s, and the United States recognised general practice in 1969.\n【34】 ### Strengthening general practice\n【35】 The standing of general practice within academic faculties of universities and professionally has undergone a marked increase in recent decades. The RACGP has been a key driver of this shift. The development and consolidation of training programs, standards for training, standards for practice, curriculum of general practice and various evidence based guidelines and publications have occurred internally within the College. Outside of the College there are a few important events:\n【36】 Demonstrating again the slow shift towards recognition, Australia was late in accepting that general practice should be taught or regarded as a discipline in its own right. The Whitlam government’s Karmel committee into ‘Expansion of Medical Education in Australia’ compromised with departments of ‘community medicine’ – a confusing anachronism that persisted for many years in Australia’s tertiary institutions. The RACGP sought strongly but unsuccessfully that this committee accept general practice into the universities.\n【37】 Today, general practice is listed or has been added along side community medicine, highlighting the shift since the early 1970s (eg Department of General Practice and Community Medicine Monash University)\n【38】 Nine foundation professors of ‘Community Practice’ were appointed between 1974 and 1976. Again Australia lagged behind the US and the UK who appointed their first professors and Chairs of general practice and family medicine in 1967 and 1963 respectively.\n【39】 The Foundation professors were:\n【40】 - Charles Bridges Webb MD FRACGP, Sydney University. Professor of Community Medicine\n【41】 - Max Kamien MD FRACP, MRCP, FRACGP, DPM, DCH University of Western Australia.

John Murtagh has along academic association through Monash University becoming the first Professor of General Practice (Neil Carson was Professor of Community Medicine). He remains with teaching positions at Monash University as Professor in General Practice, University of Notre Dame as Adjunct Clinical Professor and Melbourne University as Professorial Fellow.\n【52】 He was associate medical editor of the Australian Family Physician (the RACGP peer reviewed journal) in 1980, editor in 1986 and held that position until 1995. He began the popular CHECK (Continuous Home Evaluation of Clinical Knowledge), he  held the position of Executive Director of Training at the RACGP at the turn of the 21st century. The RACGP library is named after John Murtagh., offering a wide range of services to Members, registrars and all health professionals working in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Controlled Health Services.\n【53】 'To add a library to a house is to give that house a soul' - Professor Michael Kidd, RACGP President 2002-2006 quoting Cicero 1st December 2005\n【54】 His companion publication Practice Tips was named as the British Medical Association's Best Primary Care Book Award in 2005.

Upon exposure to enzymes and gut flora in the human intestine, linamarin and its methylated relative lotaustralin can decompose to the toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide; hence food uses of plants that contain significant quantities of linamarin are inhibited by extensive preparation and detoxification requirements. Linamarin itself is not acutely toxic, although neurotoxic effects of long-term exposure have been suggested. Consumption of linamarin-containing cassava products is widespread in the developing world and has been associated with dietary toxicity, particularly with the upper motor neuron disease known as konzo to the African populations in which it was first described, through the work of Hans Rosling. Dietary exposure to linamarin has  been reported as a risk factor in developing glucose intolerance and diabetes, although studies in experimental animals have been inconsistent in reproducing this effect and may indicate that the primary effect is in aggravating existing conditions rather than inducing diabetes on its own.\n【2】 The generation of cyanide from linamarin is usually enzymatic and occurs when linamarin is exposed to linamarase, an enzyme normally expressed in the cell walls of cassava plants. Because the resulting cyanide derivatives are volatile, processing methods that induce such exposure are common traditional means of cassava preparation; foodstuffs are usually made from cassava after extended blanching, boiling, or fermentation. Food products made from cassava plants include garri (toasted cassava tubers), porridge-like fufu, the dough agbelima, and cassava flour.\n【3】 Recent research efforts have developed a transgenic cassava plant that stably downregulates linamarin production via RNA interference.\n", "seq_id": 30129, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:14", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:31:38"}

It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory, and to tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during your treatment. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and on how your infection and symptoms respond to the medication.\n【5】 # Precautions\n【6】 Before administering gatifloxacin:\n【7】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to gatifloxacin (Tequin, Zymar); other quinolone antibiotics including cinoxacin (Cinobac) (not available in the United States), ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Cipro), enoxacin (Penetrex) (not available in the United States), gemifloxacin (Factive), levofloxacin (Iquix, Levaquin, Quixin), lomefloxacin (Maxaquin), moxifloxacin (Avelox, Vigamox), nalidixic acid (NegGram), norfloxacin (Noroxin), ofloxacin (Floxin, Ocuflox), sparfloxacin (Zagam), and trovafloxacin and alatrofloxacin combination (Trovan) (not available in the United States); or any other medications.\n【8】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: certain other antibiotics, including erythromycin (E.E.S., others); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); certain antidepressants ('mood elevators'); antipsychotics (medications for mental illness); cisapride (Propulsid) (not available in the United States); diuretics ('water pills') including furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Diurel, others); certain medications to control irregular heartbeat including amiodarone (Cordarone), digoxin (Digitek, Lanoxicaps, Lanoxin), disopyramide (Norpace),dofetilide (Tikosyn), procainamide (Pronestyl), quinidine (Quinidex), and sotalol (Betapace); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn);and probenecid (Benemid). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n【9】 - tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause fainting or irregular heartbeat) or an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG; heart rhythm test). Also tell your doctor if you have recently had a heart attack, and if you have or have ever had a slow heartbeat; low levels of potassium in your blood; cerebral atherosclerosis ; diabetes;seizures;or heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n【10】 - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using gatifloxacin, call your doctor .\n【11】 - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using gatifloxacin.\n【12】 - you should know that this medication may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and drowsiness. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or participate in other activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until you know how gatifloxacin will affect you.\n【13】 - plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light (tanning beds) and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Gatifloxacin may make your skin sensitive to sunlight. Call your healthcare provider if you develop skin redness, blisters, or bumps during your treatment.\n【14】 - you should know that your blood sugar may increase or decrease during your treatment with gatifloxacin. These changes in blood sugar may be serious or life-threatening. You are most likely to experience changes in your blood sugar if you have diabetes. However, you may experience changes in your blood sugar even if you do not have diabetes. Tell your doctor if you have diabetes or any other condition that causes your blood sugar to be too high or too low. If you have diabetes, your doctor will probably tell you not to take gatifloxacin. Also tell your doctor if you are taking other medications that may affect your blood sugar, such as insulin or oral medications for diabetes including glyburide (DiaBeta, Glycron, Glynase, Micronase, in Glucovance). Talk to your doctor about how to monitor your blood sugar during your treatment and the steps to take if your blood sugar increases or decreases.\n【15】 - tell your doctor if you have ever had tendonitis (swelling or tearing of a fiber that connects a bone to a muscle) and if you participate in regular athletic activity, or if you are taking oral steroids such as methylprednisolone (Medrol) and prednisone (Deltasone). There is a risk that you may develop tendonitis while using gatifloxacin. If you experience symptoms of tendonitis, such as pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle, stop using gatifloxacin, rest, and call your doctor immediately.\n【16】 # Administering your medication\n【17】 Before you administer gatifloxacin, look at the solution closely. It should be free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider. It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not skip doses, stop your treatment, or change your dosing schedule for any reason without talking to your health care provider. If you stop your treatment early or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n【18】 Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as a blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your treatment can continue.\n【19】 # Side effects\n【20】 ## Minor side effects\n【21】 This medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n【22】 You may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) while you are using this medication. Your doctor will tell you what you should do if you develop hypoglycemia. He or she may tell you to check your blood sugar; eat or drink a food or beverage that contains sugar, such as hard candy or fruit juice; or get medical care. Follow these directions carefully if you have any of the following symptoms of hypoglycemia:\n【23】 - shakiness\n【24】 - dizziness or lightheadedness\n【25】 - sweating\n【26】 - nervousness or irritability\n【27】 - sudden changes in behavior or mood\n【28】 - headache\n【29】 - numbness or tingling around the mouth\n【30】 - weakness\n【31】 - pale skin\n【32】 - hunger\n【33】 - clumsy or jerky movements\n【34】 If hypoglycemia is not treated, severe symptoms may develop.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include ], vasodilatation, chloasma, hirsutism, injection site reaction, pruritus, weight change, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, backache, leg cramp, asthenia, headache, migraine, depression, disturbance in mood, disorder of menstruation, pain of breast, vaginitis, withdrawal bleeding, cough, and pharyngitis.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 ### Indication\n【9】 - Treatment of atrophic vaginitis and kraurosis vulvae\n【10】 - Treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause\n【11】 ### Dosage\n【12】 - Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should  be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.\n【13】 - A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin.\n【14】 - Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.\n【15】 - conjugated estrogens is administered intravaginally in a cyclic regimen (daily for 21 days and then off for 7 days). Generally, women should be started at the 0.5 g dosage strength. Dosage adjustments (0.5 to 2 g) may be made based on individual response.\n【16】 - Conjugated estrogens(0.5 g) is administered intravaginally in a twice-weekly (for example, Monday and Thursday) continuous regimen or in a cyclic regimen of 21 days of therapy followed by 7 days off of therapy.\n【17】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【18】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【19】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in adult patients.\n【20】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【21】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in adult patients.\n【22】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【23】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【24】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in pediatric patients.\n【25】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【26】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【27】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in pediatric patients.\n【28】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【29】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in pediatric patients.\n【30】 # Contraindications\n【31】 - Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.\n【32】 - Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer.\n【33】 - Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia.\n【34】 - Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions.\n【35】 - Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.\n【36】 - Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema to PREMARIN Vaginal Cream.\n【37】 - Known liver dysfunction or disease.\n【38】 - Known protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders.\n【39】 - Known or suspected pregnancy.\n【40】 # Warnings\n【41】 ### Cardiovascular Disorders\n【42】 - An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy.\n【43】 - An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy.\n【44】 - Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n【45】 - Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\n【46】 - In the WHI estrogen-alone sub study, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n【47】 - Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).\n【48】 - In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years).  The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n【49】 - In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on CHD events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo.\n【50】 - In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a non-statistically significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5.\n【51】 - In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE 0.625 mg/MPA 2.5 mg demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit.\n【52】 - During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year one, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one  women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open-label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in the HERS, the HERS II, and overall.\n【53】 - In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n【54】 - In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were  demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n【55】 ### Malignant Neoplasms\n【56】 - An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogen for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n【57】 - The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk  0..\n【58】 - The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo, respectively. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.\n【59】 - Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have  reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies  suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n【60】 - The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.\n【61】 - All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n【62】 - The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 – 3.. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association.\n【63】 ### Probable Dementia\n【64】 - In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n【65】 - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years.\n【66】 - In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.\n【67】 - After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI 1.21–3.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years.\n【68】 - When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19–2.. Since both substudies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n【69】 ### Gallbladder Disease\n【70】 - A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving postmenopausal estrogens has been reported.\n【71】 ### Hypercalcemia\n【72】 - Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.\n【73】 ### Visual Abnormalities\n【74】 - Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogen. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen should be permanently discontinued.\n【75】 ### Anaphylactic Reaction and Angioedema\n【76】 - Cases of anaphylaxis, which developed within minutes to hours after using PREMARIN Intravenous and require emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted.\n【77】 - Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands, and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients using PREMARIN Intravenous. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with PREMARIN Intravenous should not receive PREMARIN Intravenous again.\n【78】 ### Hereditary Angioedema\n【79】 - Exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedem, particularly in women with hereditary angioedema.\n【80】 ## Precautions\n【81】 ### General\n【82】 - Premarin Intravenous for injection is indicated for short-term use. However, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions associated with oral Premarin treatment should be taken into account.\n【83】 - Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n【84】 - There are, however, possible risks which may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogen compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.\n【85】 - In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.\n【86】 - In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.\n【87】 - Estrogen may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.\n【88】 - Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are  receiving estrogen may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n【89】 - Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen are prescribed.\n【90】 - Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in individuals with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.\n【91】 - A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.\n【92】 - Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.\n【93】 # Adverse Reactions\n【94】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【95】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n【96】 - In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of conjugated estrogens(PVC), a total of 423 postmenopausal women received at least 1 dose of study medication and were included in all safety analyses: 143 women in the PVC-21/7 treatment group (0.5 g PVC daily for 21 days, then 7 days off), 72 women in the matching placebo treatment group; 140 women in the PVC-2×/wk treatment group (0.5 g PVC twice weekly), 68 women in the matching placebo treatment group. A 40-week, open-label extension followed, in which a total of 394 women received treatment with PVC, including those subjects randomized at baseline to placebo. In this study, the most common adverse reactions ≥ 1 percent in the double blind phase are shown below\n【97】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【98】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PREMARIN Vaginal Cream. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n【99】 - Abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting, dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain, increase in size of uterine leiomyomata, vaginitis (including vaginal candidiasis), change in cervical secretion, cystitis-like syndrome, application site reactions of vulvovaginal discomfort, (including burning, irritation, and genital pruritus), endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, precocious puberty, leukorrhea.\n【100】 - Tenderness, enlargement, pain, discharge, fibrocystic breast changes, breast cancer, gynecomastia in males.\n【101】 - Deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, increase in blood pressure.\n【102】 - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, increased incidence of gallbladder disease.\n【103】 - Chloasma that may persist when drug is discontinued, loss of scalp hair, hirsutism, rash.\n【104】 - Retinal vascular thrombosis, intolerance to contact lenses.\n【105】 - Headache, migraine, dizziness, mental depression, nervousness, mood disturbances, irritability, dementia.\n【106】 - Increase or decrease in weight, glucose intolerance, edema, arthralgias, leg cramps, changes in libido, urticaria, exacerbation of asthma, increased triglycerides, hypersensitivity.\n【107】 - Additional postmarketing adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving other forms of hormone therapy.\n【108】 # Drug Interactions\n【109】 - No drug interaction studies have been conducted for PREMARIN Vaginal Cream.\n【110】 - In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A. Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice, may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.\n【111】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【112】 ### Pregnancy\n【113】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【114】 - Conjugated estrogensshould not be used during pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early pregnancy.\n【115】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【116】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【117】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in women who are pregnant.\n【118】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【119】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) during labor and delivery.\n【120】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【121】 - The conjugated estrogens should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the breast milk of women receiving estrogen therapy. Caution should be exercised when conjugated estrogens is administered to a nursing woman.\n【122】 ### Pediatric Use\n【123】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) with respect to pediatric patients.\n【124】 ### Geriatic Use\n【125】 - There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing conjugated estrogens to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to PREMARIN Vaginal Cream.\n【126】 - In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE -alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age.\n【127】 - In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE  plus MPA  versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age.\n【128】 - In the WHIMS ancillary studies ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo.\n【129】 - Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n【130】 ### Gender\n【131】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) with respect to specific gender populations.\n【132】 ### Race\n【133】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) with respect to specific racial populations.\n【134】 ### Renal Impairment\n【135】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in patients with renal impairment.\n【136】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【137】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【138】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【139】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【140】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【141】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【142】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【143】 ### Administration\n【144】 - Vaginal\n【145】 ### Monitoring\n【146】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in the drug label.\n【147】 # IV Compatibility\n【148】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in the drug label.\n【149】 # Overdosage\n【150】 - Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, drowsiness and fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding may occur in women. Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of PREMARIN therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.\n【151】 # Pharmacology\n【152】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【153】 - Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women.\n【154】 - Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.\n【155】 - Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.\n【156】 ## Structure\n【157】 - Each gram of PREMARIN (conjugated estrogens) Vaginal Cream contains 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, USP in a nonliquefying base containing cetyl esters wax, cetyl alcohol, white wax, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, methyl stearate, benzyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, glycerin, and mineral oil. conjugated estrogens is applied intravaginally.\n【158】 conjugated estrogenscontains a mixture of conjugated estrogens obtained exclusively from natural sources, occurring as the sodium salts of water-soluble estrogen sulfates blended to represent the average composition of material derived from pregnant mares' urine. It is a mixture of sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate. It contains as concomitant components, sodium sulfate conjugates, 17 α-dihydroequilin, 17 α-estradiol, and 17 β-dihydroequilin.\n【159】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【160】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in the drug label.\n【161】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【162】 - Conjugated estrogens are water soluble and are well-absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The vaginal delivery of estrogens circumvents first-pass metabolism.\n【163】 - A bioavailability study was conducted in 24 postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis. The mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for unconjugated estrone, unconjugated estradiol, total estrone, total estradiol and total equilin following 7 once-daily doses of conjugated estrogens 0.5 g is shown in\n【164】 - The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentration in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.\n【165】 - Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens  undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\n【166】 - Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.\n【167】 - No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in specific populations, including patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n【168】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【169】 - Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n【170】 # Clinical Studies\n【171】 - A 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of 2 conjugated estrogens(PVC) regimens 0.5 g (0.3 mg CE) administered twice weekly and 0.5 g (0.3 mg CE) administered sequentially for 21 days on drug followed by 7 days off drug to matching placebo regimens in the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. The initial 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase was followed by an open-label phase to assess endometrial safety through week 52. The study randomized 423 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 44 to 77 years of age (mean 57.8 years), who at baseline had ≤ 5 percent superficial cells on a vaginal smear, a vaginal pH ≥ 5.0, and who identified a most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The majority (92.2 percent) of the women were Caucasian (n = ; 7.8 percent were Other (n = . All subjects were assessed for improvement in the mean change from baseline to Week 12 for the co-primary efficacy variables of: most bothersome symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (defined as the moderate to severe symptom that had been identified by the woman as most bothersome to her at baseline); percentage of vaginal superficial cells and percentage of vaginal parabasal cells; and vaginal pH.\n【172】 - In the 12-week, double-blind phase, a statistically significant mean change between baseline and Week 12 in the symptom of dyspareunia was observed for both of the conjugated estrogens regimens (0.5 g twice weekly and 0.5 g daily for 21 days, then 7 days off) compared to matching placebo, see TABLE 3. Also demonstrated for each conjugated estrogens regimen compared to placebo was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of superficial cells at Week 12 (28 percent and 26 percent, respectively, compared to 3 percent and 1 percent for matching placebo), a statistically significant decrease in parabasal cells (-61 percent and -58 percent, respectively, compared to -21 percent and -7 percent for matching placebo) and statistically significant mean reduction between baseline and Week 12 in vaginal pH (-1.62 and -1.57, respectively, compared to -0.36 and -0.26 for matching placebo).\n【173】 - Endometrial safety was assessed by endometrial biopsy for all randomly assigned subjects at week 52. For the 155 subjects (83 on the 21/7 regimen, 72 on the twice-weekly regimen) completing the 52-week period with complete follow-up and evaluable endometrial biopsies, there were no reports of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma.\n【174】 - The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age and older (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n【175】 - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n【176】 - The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years; 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n【177】 - After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21–3.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included AD, VaD and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n【178】 - When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19–2.. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n【179】 # How Supplied\n【180】 - PREMARIN (conjugated estrogens) Vaginal Cream—Each gram contains 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, USP.\n【181】 - Combination package: Each contains a net wt of 1.06 oz (30 g) tube with plastic applicator(s) calibrated in 0.5 g increments to a maximum of 2 g (NDC 0046-0872-, or a net wt. 1.5 oz (42.5 g) tube with one plastic applicator calibrated in 0.5 g increments to a maximum of 2 g (NDC 0046-0872-.\n【182】 ## Storage\n【183】 - Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F)\n【184】 # Images\n【185】 ## Drug Images\n【186】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【187】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【188】 There is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) in the drug label.\n【189】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【190】 - Alcohol-Conjugated estrogens (vaginal) interaction has not been established.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include arthralgia and nausea.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 ### Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture\n【9】 - Teriparatide is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.\n【10】 - In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, teriparatide reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.\n【11】 - Dosage: 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.\n【12】 ### Increase of Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture\n【13】 - Teriparatide is indicated to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.\n【14】 - Dosage: 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.\n【15】 ### Treatment of Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture\n【16】 - Teriparatide is indicated for the treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone) at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.\n【17】 - Dosage: 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day\n【18】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【19】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【20】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Teriparatide in adult patients.\n【21】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Teriparatide in adult patients.\n【23】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【24】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【25】 Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients\n【26】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【27】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【28】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Teriparatide in pediatric patients.\n【29】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【30】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Teriparatide in pediatric patients.\n【31】 # Contraindications\n【32】 Do not use teriparatide in patients with:\n【33】 - Hypersensitivity to teriparatide or to any of its excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis\n【34】 # Warnings\n【35】 ### Osteosarcoma\n【36】 In male and female rats, teriparatide caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. Teriparatide should not be prescribed for patients at increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma.\n【37】 These inclu\n【38】 - Paget's disease of bone. Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase may indicate Paget's disease of bone.\n【39】 - Pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses.\n【40】 - Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.\n【41】 Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the voluntary teriparatide Patient Registry, which is designed to collect information about any potential risk of osteosarcoma in patients who have taken teriparatide.\n【42】 ### Treatment Duration\n【43】 The safety and efficacy of teriparatide have not been evaluated beyond 2 years of treatment. Consequently, use of the drug for more than 2 years during a patients' lifetime is not recommended.\n【44】 ### Bone Metastases and Skeletal Malignancies\n【45】 Patients with bone metastases or a history of skeletal malignancies should not be treated with teriparatide.\n【46】 ### Metabolic Bone Diseases\n【47】 Patients with metabolic bone diseases other than osteoporosis should not be treated with teriparatide.\n【48】 ### Hypercalcemia and Hypercalcemic Disorders\n【49】 teriparatide has not been studied in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia. These patients should not be treated with teriparatide because of the possibility of exacerbating hypercalcemia. Patients known to have an underlying hypercalcemic disorder, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, should not be treated with teriparatide.\n【50】 ### Urolithiasis or Pre-existing Hypercalciuria\n【51】 In clinical trials, the frequency of urolithiasis was similar in patients treated with teriparatide and placebo. However, teriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. If active urolithiasis or pre-existing hypercalciuria are suspected, measurement of urinary calcium excretion should be considered. Teriparatide should be used with caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this condition.\n【52】 ### Orthostatic Hypotension\n【53】 teriparatide should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies with teriparatide, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of patients. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.\n【54】 ### Drug Interactions\n【55】 Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium, patients receiving digoxin should use teriparatide with caution.\n【56】 # Adverse Reactions\n【57】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【58】 Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n【59】 ### Treatment of Osteoporosis in Men and Postmenopausal Women\n【60】 The safety of teriparatide in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1382 patients (21% men, 79% women) aged 28 to 86 years (mean 67 years). The median durations of the trials were 11 months for men and 19 months for women, with 691 patients exposed to teriparatide and 691 patients to placebo. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.\n【61】 The incidence of all cause mortality was 1% in the teriparatide group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 16% in teriparatide patients and 19% in placebo patients. Early discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 7% of teriparatide patients and 6% of placebo patients.\n【62】 TABLE 1 lists adverse events from the two principal osteoporosis trials in men and postmenopausal women that occurred in ≥2% of teriparatide-treated and more frequently than placebo-treated patients.\n【63】 - Immunogenicity: In the clinical trial, antibodies that cross-reacted with teriparatide were detected in 3% of women (15/ receiving teriparatide. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and diminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions or allergic reactions among these patients. Antibody formation did not appear to have effects on serum calcium, or on bone mineral density (BMD) response.\n【64】 - Serum Calcium: teriparatide transiently increased serum calcium, with the maximal effect observed at approximately 4 to 6 hours post-dose. Serum calcium measured at least 16 hours post-dose was not different from pretreatment levels. In clinical trials, the frequency of at least 1 episode of transient hypercalcemia in the 4 to 6 hours after teriparatide administration was increased from 2% of women and none of the men treated with placebo to 11% of women and 6% of men treated with teriparatide. The number of patients treated with teriparatide whose transient hypercalcemia was verified on consecutive measurements was 3% of women and 1% of men.\n【65】 - Urinary Calcium: teriparatide increased urinary calcium excretion, but the frequency of hypercalciuria in clinical trials was similar for patients treated with teriparatide and placebo.\n【66】 - Serum Uric Acid: teriparatide increased serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 3% of teriparatide patients had serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 1% of placebo patients. However, the hyperuricemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis.\n【67】 - Renal Function: No clinically important adverse renal effects were observed in clinical studies. Assessments included creatinine clearance; measurements of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes in serum; urine specific gravity and pH; and examination of urine sediment.\n【68】 ### Studies in Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis\n【69】 The safety of teriparatide in the treatment of men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with ≥ 5mg per day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months. The duration of the trial was 18 months with 214 patients exposed to teriparatide and 214 patients exposed to oral daily bisphosphonate (active control). All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.\n【70】 The incidence of all cause mortality was 4% in the teriparatide group and 6% in the active control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 21% in teriparatide patients and 18% in active control patients, and included pneumonia (3% teriparatide, 1% active control). Early discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15% of teriparatide patients and 12% of active control patients, and included dizziness (2% teriparatide, 0% active control).\n【71】 Adverse events reported at a higher incidence in the teriparatide group and with at least a 2% difference in teriparatide-treated patients compared with active control-treated patients were: nausea (14%, 7%), gastritis (7%, 3%), pneumonia (6%, 3%), dyspnea (6%, 3%), insomnia (5%, 1%), anxiety (4%, 1%), and herpes zoster (3%, 1%), respectively.\n【72】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【73】 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of teriparatide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n【74】 - Osteosarcoma: Cases of bone tumor and osteosarcoma have been reported rarely in the postmarketing period. The causality to teriparatide use is unclear. Long term osteosarcoma surveillance studies are ongoing.\n【75】 - Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia greater than 13.0 mg/dL has been reported with teriparatide use.\n【76】 Adverse events reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to teriparatide therapy include the following:\n【77】 - Allergic Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, drug hypersensitivity, angioedema, urticaria\n【78】 - Investigations: Hyperuricemia\n【79】 - Respiratory System: Acute dyspnea, chest pain\n【80】 - Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasms of the leg or back\n【81】 - Other: Injection site reactions including injection site pain, swelling and bruising; oro-facial edema.\n【82】 # Drug Interactions\n【83】 ### Digoxin\n【84】 - A single teriparatide dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin's calcium-mediated cardiac effect).\n【85】 - However, because teriparatide may transiently increase serum calcium, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digoxin.\n【86】 ### Hydrochlorothiazide\n【87】 - The coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with teriparatide did not affect the serum calcium response to teriparatide 40 mcg.\n【88】 - The effect of coadministration of a higher dose of hydrochlorothiazide with teriparatide on serum calcium levels has not been studied.\n【89】 ### Furosemide\n【90】 - Coadministration of intravenous furosemide (20 to 100 mg) with teriparatide 40 mcg in healthy people and patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CrCl 13 to 72 mL/min) resulted in small increases in the serum calcium (2%) and 24-hour urine calcium (37%) responses to teriparatide that did not appear to be clinically important.\n【91】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【92】 ### Pregnancy\n【93】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【94】 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of teriparatide in pregnant women. In animal studies, teriparatide increased skeletal deviations and variations in mouse offspring at doses more than 60 times the equivalent human dose and produced mild growth retardation and reduced motor activity in rat offspring at doses more than 120 times the equivalent human dose. teriparatide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n【95】 In animal studies, pregnant mice received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses 8 to 267 times the human dose. At doses ≥ 60 times the human dose, the fetuses showed an increased incidence of skeletal deviations or variations (interrupted rib, extra vertebra or rib). When pregnant rats received subcutaneous teriparatide during organogenesis at doses 16 to 540 times the human dose, the fetuses showed no abnormal findings.\n【96】 In a perinatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received subcutaneous teriparatide from organogenesis through lactation. Mild growth retardation in female offspring at doses ≥120 times the human dose (based on surface area, mcg/m. Mild growth retardation in male offspring and reduced motor activity in both male and female offspring occurred at maternal doses 540 times the human dose. There were no developmental or reproductive effects in mice or rats at doses 8 or 16 times the human dose, respectively.\n【97】 Exposure multiples were normalized based on body surface area (mcg/m. Actual animal doses: mice (30 to 1000 mcg/kg/day); rats (30 to 1000 mcg/kg/day).\n【98】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【99】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Teriparatide in women who are pregnant.\n【100】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【101】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Teriparatide during labor and delivery.\n【102】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【103】 It is not known whether teriparatide is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for teriparatide in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【104】 ### Pediatric Use\n【105】 The safety and efficacy of teriparatide have not been established in any pediatric population. teriparatide should not be prescribed in patients at an increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma which include pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses. Therefore, teriparatide is not indicated for use in pediatric or young adult patients with open epiphyses.\n【106】 ### Geriatic Use\n【107】 Of the patients receiving teriparatide in the osteoporosis trial of 1637 postmenopausal women, 75% were 65 years of age and over and 23% were 75 years of age and over. Of the patients receiving teriparatide in the osteoporosis trial of 437 men, 39% were 65 years of age and over and 13% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n【108】 ### Gender\n【109】 Although systemic exposure to teriparatide was approximately 20% to 30% lower in men than women, the recommended dose for both genders is 20 mcg/day.\n【110】 ### Race\n【111】 The populations included in the pharmacokinetic analyses were 98.5% Caucasian. The influence of race has not been determined.\n【112】 ### Renal Impairment\n【113】 In 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl<30 mL/min), the AUC and T1/2 of teriparatide were increased by 73% and 77%, respectively. Maximum serum concentration of teriparatide was not increased.\n【114】 No pharmacokinetic differences were identified in 11 patients with mild or moderate renal impairment  administered a single dose of teriparatide. In 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl<30 mL/min), the AUC and T1/2 of teriparatide were increased by 73% and 77%, respectively. Maximum serum concentration of teriparatide was not increased. No studies have been performed in patients undergoing dialysis for chronic renal failure.\n【115】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【116】 No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【117】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【118】 No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous teriparatide doses of 30, 100, or 300 mcg/kg/day prior to mating and in females continuing through gestation Day 6 (16 to 160 times the human dose of 20 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m.\n【119】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【120】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Teriparatide in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【121】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【122】 ### Administration\n【123】 Subcutaneous\n【124】 ### Monitoring\n【125】 There is limited information regarding Teriparatide Monitoring in the drug label.\n【126】 # IV Compatibility\n【127】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Teriparatide and IV administrations.\n【128】 # Overdosage\n【129】 Incidents of overdose in humans have not been reported in clinical trials. Teriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 mcg and in repeated doses of up to 60 mcg/day for 6 weeks. The effects of overdose that might be expected include a delayed hypercalcemic effect and risk of orthostatic hypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache might  occur.\n【130】 In postmarketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication errors in which the entire contents (up to 800 mcg) of the teriparatide delivery device (pen) have been administered as a single dose. Transient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, no adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have been reported.\n【131】 There is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include discontinuation of teriparatide, monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus, and implementation of appropriate supportive measures, such as hydration.\n【132】 # Pharmacology\n【133】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【134】 Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues.\n【135】 The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.\n【136】 ## Structure\n【137】 It has an identical sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids (the biologically active region) of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone.\n【138】 Teriparatide has a molecular weight of 4117.8 daltons and its amino acid sequence is shown below:\n【139】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【140】 Effects on Mineral Metabolism — Teriparatide affects calcium and phosphorus metabolism in a pattern consistent with the known actions of endogenous PTH (e.g., increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphorus).\n【141】 Serum Calcium Concentrations — When teriparatide 20 mcg is administered once daily, the serum calcium concentration increases transiently, beginning approximately 2 hours after dosing and reaching a maximum concentration between 4 and 6 hours (median increase, 0.4 mg/dL). The serum calcium concentration begins to decline approximately 6 hours after dosing and returns to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose.\n【142】 In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with teriparatide (teriparatide 20 mcg) was 2.42 mmol/L (9.68 mg/dL) at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL) in >99% of women at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.\n【143】 In this study, 11.1% of women treated with teriparatide had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal  compared with 1.5% of women treated with placebo. The percentage of women treated with teriparatide whose serum calcium was above the upper limit of normal on consecutive 4- to 6-hour post-dose measurements was 3.0% compared with 0.2% of women treated with placebo. In these women, calcium supplements and/or teriparatide doses were reduced. The timing of these dose reductions was at the discretion of the investigator. teriparatide dose adjustments were made at varying intervals after the first observation of increased serum calcium (median 21 weeks). During these intervals, there was no evidence of progressive increases in serum calcium.\n【144】 In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, the effects on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with teriparatide was 2.35 mmol/L (9.44 mg/dL) at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL) in 98% of men at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.\n【145】 In this study, 6.0% of men treated with teriparatide daily had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal  compared with none of the men treated with placebo. The percentage of men treated with teriparatide whose serum calcium was above the upper limit of normal on consecutive measurements was 1.3% (2 men) compared with none of the men treated with placebo. Although calcium supplements and/or teriparatide doses could have been reduced in these men, only calcium supplementation was reduced.\n【146】 In a clinical study of women previously treated for 18 to 39 months with raloxifene (n= or alendronate (n=, mean serum calcium >12 hours after teriparatide injection was increased by 0.09 to 0.14 mmol/L (0.36 to 0.56 mg/dL), after 1 to 6 months of teriparatide treatment compared with baseline. Of the women pretreated with raloxifene, 3 (11.5%) had a serum calcium >2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL), and of those pretreated with alendronate, 3 (9.1%) had a serum calcium >2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL). The highest serum calcium reported was 3.12 mmol/L (12.5 mg/dL). None of the women had symptoms of hypercalcemia. There were no placebo controls in this study.\n【147】 In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.\n【148】 Urinary Calcium Excretion — In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily teriparatide increased urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 4.8 mmol/day (190 mg/day) at 6 months and 4.2 mmol/day (170 mg/day) at 12 months. These levels were 0.76 mmol/day (30 mg/day) and 0.3 mmol/day (12 mg/day) higher, respectively, than in women treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (>7.5 mmol Ca/day or 300 mg/day) was similar in the women treated with teriparatide or placebo.\n【149】 In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily teriparatide had inconsistent effects on urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 5.6 mmol/day (220 mg/day) at 1 month and 5.3 mmol/day (210 mg/day) at 6 months. These levels were 0.5 mmol/day (20 mg/day) higher and 0.2 mmol/day (8.0 mg/day) lower, respectively, than in men treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (>7.5 mmol Ca/day or 300 mg/day) was similar in the men treated with teriparatide or placebo.\n【150】 Phosphorus and Vitamin D — In single-dose studies, teriparatide produced transient phosphaturia and mild transient reductions in serum phosphorus concentration. However, hypophosphatemia (<0.74 mmol/L or 2.4 mg/dL) was not observed in clinical trials with teriparatide.\n【151】 In clinical trials of daily teriparatide, the median serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was increased at 12 months by 19% in women and 14% in men, compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration decreased by 2% in women and increased by 5% in men. The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at 12 months was decreased by 19% in women and 10% in men compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration was unchanged in women and increased by 1% in men.\n【152】 In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum phosphorus were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.\n【153】 Effects on Markers of Bone Turnover — Daily administration of teriparatide to men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in clinical studies stimulated bone formation, as shown by increases in the formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP). Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men.\n【154】 In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum markers of bone turnover were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.\n【155】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【156】 Teriparatide is absorbed after subcutaneous injection; the absolute bioavailability is approximately 95% based on pooled data from 20-, 40-, and 80- mcg doses. The rates of absorption and elimination are rapid. The peptide reaches peak serum concentrations about 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection of a 20-mcg dose and declines to non-quantifiable concentrations within 3 hours.\n【157】 Systemic clearance of teriparatide (approximately 62 L/hr in women and 94 L/hr in men) exceeds the rate of normal liver plasma flow, consistent with both hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance. Volume of distribution, following intravenous injection, is approximately 0.12 L/kg. Intersubject variability in systemic clearance and volume of distribution is 25% to 50%. The half-life of teriparatide in serum is 5 minutes when administered by intravenous injection and approximately 1 hour when administered by subcutaneous injection. The longer half-life following subcutaneous administration reflects the time required for absorption from the injection site.\n【158】 No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide. However, the mechanisms of metabolism and elimination of PTH and intact PTH have been extensively described in published literature. Peripheral metabolism of PTH is believed to occur by non-specific enzymatic mechanisms in the liver followed by excretion via the kidneys.\n【159】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【160】 Two carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in Fischer 344 rats. In the first study, male and female rats were given daily subcutaneous teriparatide injections of 5, 30, or 75 mcg/kg/day for 24 months from 2 months of age. These doses resulted in systemic exposures that were, respectively, 3, 20, and 60 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Teriparatide treatment resulted in a marked dose-related increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma, a rare malignant bone tumor, in both male and female rats. Osteosarcomas were observed at all doses and the incidence reached 40% to 50% in the high-dose groups. Teriparatide  caused a dose-related increase in osteoblastoma and osteoma in both sexes. No osteosarcomas, osteoblastomas or osteomas were observed in untreated control rats. The bone tumors in rats occurred in association with a large increase in bone mass and focal osteoblast hyperplasia.\n【161】 The second 2-year study was carried out in order to determine the effect of treatment duration and animal age on the development of bone tumors. Female rats were treated for different periods between 2 and 26 months of age with subcutaneous doses of 5 and 30 mcg/kg (equivalent to 3 and 20 times the human exposure at the 20-mcg dose, based on AUC comparison). The study showed that the occurrence of osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma and osteoma was dependent upon dose and duration of exposure. Bone tumors were observed when immature 2-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day for 24 months or with 5 or 30 mcg/kg/day for 6 months. Bone tumors were  observed when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day for 6 or 20 months. Tumors were not detected when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 5 mcg/kg/day for 6 or 20 months. The results did not demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to bone tumor formation, associated with teriparatide treatment, between mature and immature rats.\n【162】 The relevance of these animal findings to humans is uncertain.\n【163】 Teriparatide was not genotoxic in any of the following test systems: the Ames test for bacterial mutagenesis; the mouse lymphoma assay for mammalian cell mutation; the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without metabolic activation; and the in vivo micronucleus test in mice.\n【164】 In single-dose rodent studies using subcutaneous injection of teriparatide, no mortality was seen in rats given doses of 1000 mcg/kg (540 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m or in mice given 10,000 mcg/kg (2700 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m.\n【165】 In a long-term study, skeletally mature ovariectomized female monkeys (N=30 per treatment group) were given either daily subcutaneous teriparatide injections of 5 mcg/kg or vehicle. Following the 18-month treatment period, the monkeys were removed from teriparatide treatment and were observed for an additional 3 years. The 5 mcg/kg dose resulted in systemic exposures that were approximately 6 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Bone tumors were not detected by radiographic or histologic evaluation in any monkey in the study.\n【166】 # Clinical Studies\n【167】 ### Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women\n【168】 The safety and efficacy of once-daily teriparatide, median exposure of 19 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 1637 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (teriparatide 20 mcg, n=.\n【169】 All women received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. Baseline and endpoint spinal radiographs were evaluated using the semiquantitative scoring. Ninety percent of the women in the study had 1 or more radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures defined as changes in the height of previously undeformed vertebrae. Such fractures are not necessarily symptomatic.\n【170】 New Vertebral Fractures: teriparatide, when taken with calcium and vitamin D and compared with calcium and vitamin D alone, reduced the risk of 1 or more new vertebral fractures from 14.3% of women in the placebo group to 5.0% in the teriparatide group. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.; the absolute reduction in risk was 9.3% and the relative reduction was 65%. teriparatide was effective in reducing the risk for vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, or baseline BMD.\n【171】 New Nonvertebral Osteoporotic Fractures: teriparatide significantly reduced the risk of any nonvertebral fracture from 5.5% in the placebo group to 2.6% in the teriparatide group (p<0.. The absolute reduction in risk was 2.9% and the relative reduction was 53%. The incidence of new nonvertebral fractures in the teriparatide group compared with the placebo group was ankle/foot (0.2%, 0.7%), hip (0.2%, 0.7%), humerus (0.4%, 0.4%), pelvis (0%, 0.6%), ribs (0.6%, 0.9%), wrist (0.4%, 1.3%), and other sites (1.1%, 1.5%), respectively.\n【172】 The cumulative percentage of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who sustained new nonvertebral fractures was lower in women treated with teriparatide than in women treated with placebo  FIGURE .\n【173】 teriparatide increased lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Statistically significant increases were seen at 3 months and continued throughout the treatment period. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were treated with teriparatide had statistically significant increases in BMD from baseline to endpoint at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body.\n【174】 teriparatide treatment increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 96% of postmenopausal women treated. Seventy-two percent of patients treated with teriparatide achieved at least a 5% increase in spine BMD, and 44% gained 10% or more.\n【175】 Both treatment groups lost height during the trial. The mean decreases were 3.61 and 2.81 mm in the placebo and teriparatide groups, respectively.\n【176】 The effects of teriparatide on bone histology were evaluated in iliac crest biopsies of 35 postmenopausal women treated for 12 to 24 months with calcium and vitamin D and teriparatide 20 or 40 mcg/day. Normal mineralization was observed with no evidence of cellular toxicity. The new bone formed with teriparatide was of normal quality (as evidenced by the absence of woven bone and marrow fibrosis).\n【177】 ### Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis\n【178】 The safety and efficacy of once-daily teriparatide, median exposure of 10 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 437 men with either primary (idiopathic) or hypogonadal osteoporosis (teriparatide 20 mcg, n=. All men received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD.\n【179】 teriparatide increased lumbar spine BMD in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis. Statistically significant increases were seen at 3 months and continued throughout the treatment period. teriparatide was effective in increasing lumbar spine BMD regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD. The effects of teriparatide at additional skeletal sites are shown in TABLE 4.\n【180】 teriparatide treatment for a median of 10 months increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 94% of men treated. Fifty-three percent of patients treated with teriparatide achieved at least a 5% increase in spine BMD, and 14% gained 10% or more.\n【181】 ### Treatment of Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis\n【182】 The efficacy of teriparatide for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with ≥5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months. The duration of the trial was 18 months with 214 patients exposed to teriparatide. In the teriparatide group, the baseline median glucocorticoid dose was 7.5 mg/day and the median duration of glucocorticoid use was 1.5 years. The mean (SD) baseline lumbar spine BMD was 0.85 ± 0.13 g/cm2 and lumbar spine BMD T-score was –2.5 ± 1 (number of standard deviations below the mean BMD value for healthy adults). A total of 30% of patients had prevalent vertebral fracture(s) and 43% had prior non-vertebral fracture(s). The patients had chronic rheumatologic, respiratory or other diseases that required sustained glucocorticoid therapy. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.\n【183】 Because of differences in mechanism of action (anabolic vs. anti-resorptive) and lack of clarity regarding differences in BMD as an adequate predictor of fracture efficacy, data on the active comparator are not presented.\n【184】 In patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, teriparatide increased lumbar spine BMD compared with baseline at 3 months through 18 months of treatment. In patients treated with teriparatide, the mean percent change in BMD from baseline to endpoint was 7.2% at the lumbar spine, 3.6% at the total hip, and 3.7% at the femoral neck (p<0.001 all sites). The relative treatment effects of teriparatide were consistent in subgroups defined by gender, age, geographic region, body mass index, underlying disease, prevalent vertebral fracture, baseline glucocorticoid dose, prior bisphosphonate use, and glucocorticoid discontinuation during trial.\n【185】 # How Supplied\n【186】 Teripatide delivery device (pen) is available in the following package size:\n【187】 - 2.4 mL prefilled delivery device NDC 0002-8400-01 (MS.\n【188】 ## Storage\n【189】 Store at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)\n【190】 # Images\n【191】 ## Drug Images\n【192】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【193】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【194】 ### Potential Risk of Osteosarcoma and Voluntary teriparatide Patient Registry\n【195】 Patients should be made aware that in rats, teriparatide caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the voluntary teriparatide Patient Registry, which is designed to collect information about any potential risk of osteosarcoma in patients who have taken teriparatide.\n【196】 ### Orthostatic Hypotension\n【197】 teriparatide should be administered initially under circumstances where the patient can immediately sit or lie down if symptoms occur. Patients should be instructed that if they feel lightheaded or have palpitations after the injection, they should sit or lie down until the symptoms resolve. If symptoms persist or worsen, patients should be instructed to consult a physician before continuing treatment.\n【198】 ### Hypercalcemia\n【199】 Although symptomatic hypercalcemia was not observed in clinical trials, physicians should instruct patients taking teriparatide to contact a health care provider if they develop persistent symptoms of hypercalcemia (e.g., nausea, vomiting, constipation, lethargy, muscle weakness).\n【200】 ### Other Osteoporosis Treatment Modalities\n【201】 Patients should be informed regarding the roles of supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, and modification of certain behavioral factors such as cigarette smoking and/or alcohol consumption.\n【202】 ### Use of Delivery Device (Pen)\n【203】 Patients and caregivers who administer teriparatide should be instructed on how to properly use the delivery device (refer to User Manual), properly dispose of needles, and be advised not to share their delivery device with other patients. The contents of the delivery device should NOT be transferred to a syringe.\n【204】 Each teriparatide delivery device can be used for up to 28 days including the first injection from the delivery device. After the 28-day use period, discard the teriparatide delivery device, even if it still contains some unused solution.\n【205】 ### Availability of Medication Guide and User Manual\n【206】 Patients should read the Medication Guide and delivery device (pen) User Manual before starting therapy with teriparatide and re-read them each time the prescription is renewed. Patients need to understand and follow the instructions in the teriparatide delivery device User Manual.

Explain that it is associated with a lower risk of postpartum haemorrhage and/or blood transfusion.\n【370】 Consider active management of the third stage with additional uterotonics for women who have 1 or more risk factors (in addition to a twin or triplet pregnancy) for postpartum haemorrhage.\n【371】 ## Blood transfusion\n【372】 By 28 weeks of pregnancy, discuss with women with a twin or triplet pregnancy the potential need for blood transfusion, including the need for intravenous access. Document this discussion in the woman's notes.\n【373】 At the start of established labour in women with a twin or triplet pregnancy:\n【374】 ensure that intravenous access is available so that prompt blood transfusion and intravenous fluids can be given if needed\n【375】 take a maternal blood sample for a full blood count and group and save.\n【376】 Ensure that the appropriate blood transfusion is available for urgent administration.\n【377】 For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on managing the third stage of labour .\n【378】 Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I: interventions to prevent postpartum haemorrhage in the third stage of labour.\n【379】 Loading. Please wait.\n【380】 # Terms used in this guideline\n【381】 ## Active management of the third stage\n【382】 In a vaginal birth, active management consists of 10 IU of oxytocin by intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the last baby and before the cord is clamped and cut. In a caesarean section, it consists of 5 IU of oxytocin by intravenous injection immediately after the birth of the last baby and before the cord is clamped and cut.\n【383】 ## Amnionicity\n【384】 The number of amnions (inner membranes) that surround babies in a multiple pregnancy. Pregnancies with 1 amnion (so that all babies share an amniotic sac) are described as monoamniotic; pregnancies with 2 amnions are diamniotic; and pregnancies with 3 amnions are triamniotic. Also see the box on chorionicity and amnionicity in twin and triplet pregnancy.\n【385】 ## Chorionicity\n【386】 The number of chorionic (outer) membranes that surround babies in a multiple pregnancy. If there is only 1 membrane, the pregnancy is described as monochorionic; if there are 2, the pregnancy is dichorionic; and if there are 3, the pregnancy is trichorionic. Monochorionic twin pregnancies and monochorionic or dichorionic triplet pregnancies carry higher risks because babies share a placenta. Also see the box on chorionicity and amnionicity in twin and triplet pregnancy.\n【387】 ## Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome\n【388】 Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome (FFTS) occurs when blood moves from one baby to another. The baby that loses the blood is called the donor and the baby receiving the blood is called the recipient. Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome is a complication of monochorionic multiple pregnancies arising from shared placental circulation. It is  referred to as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in twin pregnancies.\n【389】 ## Group and save\n【390】 This is a blood sampling process. It consists of a blood group and an antibody screen to determine the woman's blood group and whether she has atypical red cell antibodies in her blood. If atypical antibodies are present, the laboratory will do additional work to identify them. This will allow blood to be issued in an emergency very quickly.\n【391】 ## Specialist obstetrician\n【392】 An obstetrician with a special interest, experience and knowledge of managing multiple pregnancy, and who works regularly with women with a multiple pregnancy.\n【393】 ## Tertiary level fetal medicine centre\n【394】 A specialist regional (or supra-regional) fetal medicine centre that has a multidisciplinary team with the expertise and infrastructure to assess and manage complicated twin and triplet pregnancies. This includes providing complex fetal interventions or therapies, for example, fetoscopic laser ablation for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome; and selective termination of pregnancy using techniques such as fetoscopic cord occlusion or radiofrequency ablation.\n【395】 ## Twin anaemia polycythaemia sequences\n【396】 Twin anaemia polycythaemia sequences (TAPS) is a complication affecting monochorionic twin or triplet pregnancies. It is a rare, chronic form of feto-fetal transfusion caused by the joining of fine blood vessels connecting the fetal circulations on the placenta. It presents when there are unequal blood counts between the twins in the womb. When TAPS occurs, the recipient twin is at risk for successively increasing blood count, called polycythaemia, and the donor twin for progressive blood loss, or anaemia. TAPS occurs without the differences in levels of amniotic fluids between the fetuses (polyhydramnios-oligohydramnios) that is usually seen in FFTS.# Recommendations for research\n【397】 The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.\n【398】 As part of the 2019 update, the guideline committee made an additional recommendation for research on the identification on twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS). The committee removed 6 of the 2011 recommendations on screening for chromosomal conditions, screening for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome, defining fetal growth restriction, predicting and preventing spontaneous preterm birth, and perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in babies born by elective birth.\n【399】 # Key recommendations for research\n【400】 ## Screening to detect twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence\n【401】 What is the most accurate prenatal screening marker for TAPS, including middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA‑PSV)?\n【402】 For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale on diagnostic monitoring for twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence .\n【403】 Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: screening for TAPS.\n【404】 Loading.

They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the committee's discussion.\n【429】 # Intrapartum care\n【430】 Recommendation 1.3.6\n【431】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【432】 The committee recognised that the core multidisciplinary team recommended by the previous guideline  recommendation 1.3. provides care during the antenatal period and would not be the same team providing intrapartum care. Because intrapartum care was added to the guideline update, they made a recommendation to clarify that healthcare professionals supporting women when they are giving birth should  have knowledge and experience in multiple pregnancy.\n【433】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【434】 The recommendation reinforces current practice.\n【435】 Return to recommendation\n【436】 # Screening for chromosomal conditions\n【437】 Recommendations 1.4.3 to 1.4.8\n【438】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【439】 Since the 2011 guideline, the National Screening Committee's recommendations on screening for fetal chromosomal conditions have been published and have been implemented by the NHS fetal anomaly screening programme (FASP). These apply to women with both singleton and twin pregnancies, so the 2011 recommendations were replaced by a cross reference to this screening programme. The committee recognised that no current guidance exists for triplets so they retained a recommendation on triplets from the 2011 guideline. However, based on their expertise they decided this existing recommendation would apply only to screening in trichorionic triplets so they made an additional recommendation about dichorionic and monochorionic triplet pregnancies. Because of the complexity of screening these types of triplet pregnancies, this screening should only be carried out after referral to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre.\n【440】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【441】 The recommendations reinforce current best practice.\n【442】 Return to recommendations\n【443】 # Screening for preterm birth\n【444】 Recommendations 1.4.13 to 1.4.15\n【445】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【446】 The committee agreed, based on their experience and expertise, that women should be given information about the higher risk of preterm birth in twin and triplet pregnancy compared with singleton pregnancy.\n【447】 The committee retained the existing 2011 recommendations that fetal fibronectin testing and home uterine activity monitoring should not be used to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm birth because there was still no evidence suggesting they were accurate.\n【448】 ## Why the committee did not make a recommendation on cervical length screening in twin pregnancy\n【449】 The evidence suggested that cervical length is a moderate predictor of spontaneous preterm birth in twin pregnancy. Although there were some inconsistencies between studies, the committee agreed they still supported the use of cervical length measurements to predict preterm birth in twin pregnancy. Establishing that a woman is at risk of preterm birth allows an intervention to be offered, and there is some evidence that vaginal progesterone may reduce this risk in women with a twin pregnancy. However, the committee was  aware that new evidence would be emerging about the use of vaginal progesterone in subgroups of women with a short cervix that could change their conclusions about its effectiveness. This uncertainty meant the committee could not recommend vaginal progesterone to prevent preterm birth. Because of this, the committee  decided they could not recommend cervical length screening in the absence of an effective intervention to offer women with a higher risk of preterm birth.\n【450】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【451】 The recommendations reinforce current best practice.\n【452】 Return to recommendations\n【453】 # Screening for fetal growth restriction and feto-fetal transfusion syndrome in the first trimester\n【454】 Recommendation 1.4.16\n【455】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【456】 There was evidence that discordance in either crown–rump length or nuchal translucency during the first trimester is not an accurate predictor of growth discordance in the second and third trimester. The committee discussed the evidence for other ultrasound screening measures in the first trimester and decided that because of its low quality they were not confident in recommending any screening tests in the first trimester.\n【457】 The evidence showed that none of the first trimester screening tests were able to detect the risk of feto-fetal transfusion syndrome developing later in the pregnancy. Although there were uncertainties in this evidence, it was supported by the committee's clinical experience and current clinical practice.\n【458】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【459】 The recommendation reinforces current practice.\n【460】 Return to recommendations\n【461】 # Diagnostic monitoring for fetal growth restriction in dichorionic twin and trichorionic triplet pregnancies\n【462】 Recommendations 1.4.17 to 1.4.23\n【463】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【464】 Based on evidence which showed that abdominal palpation and symphysis–fundal height were not accurate measurements to diagnose fetal growth restriction, the committee recommended that these should not be used.\n【465】 Fetal growth restriction is associated with perinatal mortality, morbidity and preterm birth. The committee agreed that monitoring using ultrasound scanning is essential to identify women in this high-risk group.\n【466】 The evidence was limited on the frequency of ultrasound scanning for women with dichorionic twin pregnancies but, based on their expertise, the committee agreed that women with a dichorionic twin pregnancy should have scans no more than 28 days apart.\n【467】 They  recommended ultrasound monitoring at least every 14 days for women with all types of triplet pregnancy (recommendations 1.4.19 and 1.4. because they are at higher risk of fetal growth restriction.\n【468】 Based on both the evidence and their expertise, the committee recommended using at least 2 different biometric parameters as well as amniotic fluid level assessment to provide greater accuracy in calculating estimated fetal weight (EFW).\n【469】 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green Top guideline on monochorionic twin pregnancy recommends referring women 'for assessment and management in fetal medicine units with recognised relevant expertise' if there is an EFW discordance of more than 20%. In the committee's experience, this level of discordance should cause concern in all types of twin and triplet pregnancy and should prompt increased monitoring. However, they recommended instead increasing to weekly monitoring and adding the extra parameter of a doppler assessment. This would be equivalent to the specialist assessment recommended by the Green Top guideline because it would need to be carried out by the specialist core team (in line with recommendation 1.3. who have experience and knowledge of managing twin and triplet pregnancies. The committee agreed that this would not be inconsistent with the Green Top guideline.\n【470】 The committee  agreed that the EFWs themselves should be taken into account. Based on the evidence and their expertise they recommended the 10th centile for gestational age as a threshold for concern that should prompt increased monitoring.\n【471】 The evidence was inconclusive about an exact threshold for referral to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre, so based on their own experience the committee decided that an EFW discordance of 25% or more (along with an EFW below the 10th centile for gestational age) should warrant referral. At this level of discordance, there would be an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality that should prompt intervention rather than increased assessment. The tertiary level fetal medicine centre would have the expertise to weigh up the benefits and risks of conservative management, birth or invasive fetal therapy to improve the chance of a positive pregnancy outcome.\n【472】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【473】 These recommendations are largely reinforcing current practice in twin pregnancy and should have a minimal impact on local ultrasound resourcing. They are consistent with other national and international guidance.\n【474】 The recommendations to monitor all women with a triplet pregnancy at no more than 14‑day intervals (irrespective of chorionicity) are a change in practice, particularly for women with a trichorionic triamniotic pregnancy. For these women, previous recommendations suggested 4‑weekly scans. However, the change is justified because all types of triplet pregnancy are at high risk of fetal growth restriction. The recommendation should not have a significant impact on clinical resources because of the low number of women with a triplet pregnancy.\n【475】 Return to recommendations\n【476】 # Diagnostic monitoring for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome\n【477】 Recommendations 1.4.24 to 1.4.29\n【478】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【479】 The committee agreed that feto-fetal transfusion syndrome is difficult to detect using amniotic fluid discordance before 16 weeks of pregnancy. After this stage, amniotic fluid levels have increased and differences between them can be used to diagnose feto-fetal transfusion syndrome. Monitoring fortnightly from 16 weeks should ensure that feto-fetal transfusion syndrome is diagnosed as early as possible. The committee decided based on their expertise – and on limited evidence from studies that conducted diagnostic scans after 24 weeks – that continuing fortnightly monitoring until birth would improve outcomes for women who develop feto-fetal transfusion syndrome later in pregnancy (although it is less common after 26 weeks). The committee  agreed that offering women with a monochorionic pregnancy scans at 14-day intervals means that the woman can be monitored efficiently for all the complications in recommendation 1.4.24 at each scan.\n【480】 To support this frequency of monitoring, the committee  increased the number of reviews by the specialist obstetrician from at least 2 (in the 2011 guideline) to at least 5 for dichorionic and monochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies (recommendation 1.3.. Dichorionic triamniotic triplets have an increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with monochorionic diamniotic twins if feto-fetal transfusion occurs. The risk of complications of monochorionicity, and of adverse outcomes if complications occur, is higher in triplets than in twins. More frequent review by the specialist obstetrician would ensure optimal critical assessment of ultrasound findings (including findings related to feto-fetal transfusion syndrome) and any need for more frequent monitoring.\n【481】 The committee agreed that making sure the amniotic membrane is visible in the scan reduces the chance of measuring the same sac twice in error and improves accuracy in identifying a difference between the babies' amniotic fluid levels.\n【482】 Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that women should be referred immediately to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre when differences in amniotic fluid levels meet the criteria for diagnosing feto-fetal transfusion syndrome. The clinical course of feto-fetal transfusion syndrome can be unpredictable so this would allow prompt assessment and early intervention. They  agreed that when differences in amniotic fluid levels are measured that do not yet meet the threshold for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome, women should be seen by their named specialist obstetrician for multiple pregnancy and offered more frequent monitoring, using doppler assessment to help detect feto-fetal transfusion syndrome as early as possible.\n【483】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【484】 Monitoring for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome from 16 weeks of pregnancy until birth is a change to current practice, in which monitoring is only carried out until week 24. Early detection would enable prompt management, and this would outweigh the cost of additional ultrasound.\n【485】 Return to recommendations\n【486】 # Diagnostic monitoring for fetal growth restriction in monochorionic twin and triplet pregnancy\n【487】 Recommendations 1.4.30 to 1.4.36\n【488】 A monochorionic twin or triplet pregnancy is one in which any of the babies share a placenta and a chorionic (outer) membrane. This includes monochorionic twins and dichorionic and monochorionic triplets.\n【489】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【490】 Based on evidence which showed that abdominal palpation and symphysis–fundal height were not accurate measurements to diagnose fetal growth restriction, the committee recommended that these should not be used.\n【491】 Fetal growth restriction is associated with perinatal mortality, morbidity and preterm birth. The committee agreed that monitoring using ultrasound scanning is essential to identify women in this high-risk group.\n【492】 The evidence was limited on the frequency of ultrasound scanning for women with monochorionic pregnancies, so the committee used their expertise to make recommendations. They agreed that women with a monochorionic twin pregnancy need more frequent scans than women with a dichorionic twin pregnancy because they have a higher risk of severe growth discordance.\n【493】 Scanning at no more than 14-day intervals would allow the woman to be referred promptly either to her specialist obstetrician for multiple pregnancy or to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre depending on the EFWs  below). The committee  agreed that because women with a monochorionic pregnancy should be having scans at 14‑day intervals to monitor for feto-fetal transfusion syndrome, these timings mean they can be monitored for both of these complications at the same time (in line with recommendation 1.4..\n【494】 The committee  recommended ultrasound monitoring at least every 14 days for women with all types of triplet pregnancy (recommendations 1.4.19 and 1.4. because they are at higher risk of fetal growth restriction.\n【495】 Based on both the evidence and their expertise, the committee recommended using at least 2 different biometric parameters as well as amniotic fluid level assessment to provide greater accuracy in calculating EFW.\n【496】 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green Top guideline on monochorionic twin pregnancy recommends referring women 'for assessment and management in fetal medicine units with recognised relevant expertise' if there is an EFW discordance of more than 20%. The committee agreed with the Green Top guideline that this level should cause concern and prompt increased monitoring, but they recommended instead increasing to weekly monitoring and adding the extra parameter of a doppler assessment. This would be equivalent to the specialist assessment recommended by the Green Top guideline because it would need to be carried out by the specialist core team (in line with recommendation 1.3. who have experience and knowledge of managing twin and triplet pregnancies. The committee agreed that this would not be inconsistent with the Green Top guideline.\n【497】 The committee  agreed that the estimated fetal weights themselves should be taken into account. Based on the evidence they recommended the 10th centile for gestational age as a threshold for concern that should prompt increased monitoring.\n【498】 The evidence was inconclusive about an exact threshold for referral to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre, so based on their own experience the committee decided that an EFW discordance of 25% or more (along with an EFW below the 10th centile) should warrant referral. At this level of discordance, there would be an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality that should prompt intervention rather than increased assessment. The tertiary level fetal medicine centre would have the expertise to weigh up the benefits and risks of conservative management, birth or invasive fetal therapy to try to improve the chance of a positive pregnancy outcome.\n【499】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【500】 These recommendations are largely reinforcing current practice in twin pregnancy and should have a minimal impact on local ultrasound resourcing. They are consistent with other national and international guidance.\n【501】 The recommendation to monitor all women with a triplet pregnancy at no more than 14‑day intervals (irrespective of chorionicity) is a change in practice, particularly for women with a trichorionic triamniotic pregnancy. For these women, previous recommendations suggested 4‑weekly scans. However, the change is justified because all types of triplet pregnancy are at high risk of fetal growth restriction. The recommendation should not have a significant impact on clinical resources because of the low number of women with a triplet pregnancy.\n【502】 Return to recommendations\n【503】 # Diagnostic monitoring for twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence\n【504】 Recommendations 1.4.37 and 1.4.38\n【505】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【506】 There was limited evidence for screening and diagnostic monitoring for twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS). The committee discussed, based on their expertise, that there is  limited evidence on the natural history of spontaneous TAPS and effective interventions for it in uncomplicated monochorionic pregnancies. They agreed that its incidence is likely to be low, so they could not recommend screening for it in women whose monochorionic pregnancy is uncomplicated.\n【507】 The committee agreed that monitoring would be beneficial for women with the complications in recommendations 1.4.37 and 1.4.38. They recommended screening for TAPS in this population for 2 reasons:\n【508】 Complicated monochorionic pregnancies have an increased risk of fetal and neonatal death and morbidity. Diagnosing TAPS as a further complication is likely to influence how the woman's pregnancy is managed, including the timing of preterm birth.\n【509】 Advanced TAPS (stages 3 and  is associated with abnormal fetal umbilical artery and ductus venosus doppler parameters, or signs of fetal cardiac failure in the anaemic baby. These can  occur in a number of other conditions, so the diagnosis of severe TAPS (either alone or as a comorbidity) may be missed if it is not specifically screened for.\n【510】 The committee concluded that for women who have a pregnancy in which TAPS is a comorbid complication or is of advanced stage, the risk to the babies without diagnosis and intervention is likely to be greater than the potential harms of interventions. These include preterm birth or potential in‑utero therapies, such as in‑utero transfusion, in pre-viable or extremely premature pregnancies.\n【511】 The committee agreed that when TAPS is suspected, women should be referred to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre. They felt that the benefits of managing complicated monochorionic pregnancies in this setting would outweigh the potential disadvantages of inconvenience of travel and transfer to units away from home. The committee decided not to specify diagnostic criteria because they wanted to emphasise the importance of referral to a tertiary level referral centre when TAPS is suspected, so that decisions about further assessment and management can be made with each individual woman.\n【512】 Given the limited evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA‑PSV) for all types of monochorionic twins, regardless of complications, and uncertainties about the natural history of TAPS and its management, the committee decided to make a recommendation for research on screening to detect twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence to inform future guidance.\n【513】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【514】 The recommendation may increase the number of assessments of women with complicated monochorionic pregnancies and referral for appropriate management. However, the committee agreed that any increase in referrals would be offset by the benefits of better detection and management of complicated monochorionic pregnancies.\n【515】 Return to recommendations\n【516】 # Preventing preterm birth\n【517】 Recommendations 1.5.1 and 1.5.2\n【518】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【519】 The evidence for intramuscular progesterone in the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth showed it had no clinical benefit and, in some instances, had negative or unpleasant side effects, so it was not recommended.\n【520】 The committee retained the existing 2011 recommendation that arabin pessary, bed rest, cervical cerclage and oral tocolytics should not be used routinely to prevent spontaneous preterm birth because there was still no evidence to support their use.\n【521】 ## Why the committee did not make a recommendation on vaginal progesterone\n【522】 The committee decided not to make recommendations on the use of vaginal progesterone to prevent preterm birth because they knew about evidence that would be emerging about the use of progesterone in subgroups of women with a short cervix that could change their conclusions about its effectiveness. This  meant the committee preferred not to recommend cervical length screening  the rationale section on cervical length screening in twin pregnancy). NICE will carry out an exceptional update based on the new evidence when it becomes available.\n【523】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【524】 The recommendations reinforce current practice.\n【525】 Return to recommendations\n【526】 # Planning birth: information and support\n【527】 Recommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.3\n【528】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【529】 The committee discussed the importance of providing care that is woman-centred, in which shared decision-making between the woman and her healthcare professional is essential. The committee agreed on the topics that need to be discussed with women to explain the available options and find out their wishes. Information needs to be tailored to each woman's pregnancy because some twin and triplet pregnancies carry more risks than others.\n【530】 The committee acknowledged equality considerations for women who may have additional needs (such as needing an interpreter) in the context of providing information and communication. They cross-referred to NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, which describes general good practice on how to do this.\n【531】 Return to recommendations\n【532】 # Timing of birth\n【533】 Recommendations 1.9.1 to 1.9.12\n【534】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【535】 The committee agreed that it was critical to give women the information they need to participate in shared decisions about when their babies are born. This includes explaining the known risk of spontaneous preterm birth in twin and triplet pregnancy and its possible consequences, such as admission to a neonatal unit. The committee retained this advice from the 2011 guideline because it was consistent with their experience and knowledge. They agreed that this information is important for planning the timing of birth.\n【536】 Women  need to know why it is recommended for them to have a planned birth by a particular week of pregnancy ( see when to offer planned birth). There is a trade-off between clinical benefits and harms when women have not given birth spontaneously by a given gestational age. These include the risks of neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with planned birth compared with the risks of stillbirth from continued pregnancy. The committee agreed that both timing and mode of birth should be discussed with women in the context of these potential risks. Women can use this advice to make an informed choice.\n【537】 There was not enough good evidence to conclusively identify the optimal timing of birth according to chorionicity and amnionicity, so the committee  used their expertise and experience to make recommendations.\n【538】 Evidence suggests a consistently higher fetal death rate (at all gestational ages) in monochorionic twin pregnancies than in dichorionic twin pregnancies. The committee therefore recommended earlier planned birth, at 36 weeks, for women with a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy to reflect the higher risk and complexity of this type of pregnancy. This was consistent with the 2011 guideline and therefore corresponds to current clinical practice.\n【539】 The committee  clarified the timing of birth for monochorionic monoamniotic twins, which was not explicitly covered by the 2011 guideline – the previous guideline did not divide monochorionic twins into diamniotic or monoamniotic groups. Based on some evidence and their own knowledge and experience, the committee recommended offering planned birth between 32+0 and 33+6 weeks because this timing did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes.\n【540】 The committee clarified the recommendations from the 2011 guideline by considering triplet pregnancies by type rather than as a single group. No evidence was found on timing of birth in triplet pregnancy but the committee agreed based on their own clinical experience that continuing an uncomplicated trichorionic triamniotic or a dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy beyond 35+6 weeks of pregnancy would lead to an increased risk of fetal death (recommendation 1.9.. Planned birth should therefore be offered at 35 weeks (recommendation 1.9..\n【541】 Because of significant risks for the babies in complicated twin and triplet pregnancies, and the rareness of monochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies and triplet pregnancies with a shared amnion, timing of birth should be assessed and discussed individually (recommendations 1.9.8 and 1.9..\n【542】 The committee highlighted that women's choice needs to be respected and that if a woman declines planned birth at the recommended time, she should be offered weekly appointments to minimise risk, monitor progress and help to identify any complications as soon as possible.\n【543】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【544】 The recommendations clarify the timing of when women with a monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy should be offered planned birth. Although this is a change from the 2011 guideline, it reinforces current practice.\n【545】 Return to recommendations\n【546】 # Mode of birth\n【547】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【548】 Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5\n【549】 For women who are more than 32 weeks pregnant and have an uncomplicated pregnancy, the evidence showed there is no significant difference in risk between vaginal birth and caesarean section, both for the woman and her babies. The committee's experience supported this, so they agreed that healthcare professionals should explain this to the woman and support her choice as long as the conditions in recommendation 1.10.1 are met and the first baby is in a head-first position.\n【550】 There was only limited evidence about mode of birth when the first baby is not head first. The committee agreed that in their clinical experience, this carries a higher risk of problems such as cord accidents during birth. Because of this, a caesarean section is the safest option to offer women after 32 weeks and for women in established preterm labour between 26 and 32 weeks.\n【551】 According to the evidence, not all women give birth according to their birth plan. The committee decided it was important to explain this to women so that they are prepared for the possibility of not giving birth in the way they prefer.\n【552】 Recommendations 1.10.6 and 1.10.7\n【553】 Monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancies and triplet pregnancies are the least common and highest-risk types of pregnancy and evidence about mode of birth was limited for these women. However, the committee agreed from their experience that caesarean section should be the preferred option and should be offered at the time the birth is planned to happen or after the diagnosis of established labour. If the first twin is close to being born vaginally there can be risks for the babies, so the committee decided that senior obstetric assessment would be needed.\n【554】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【555】 The recommendations largely reflect current practice. Supporting the woman's preferred mode of birth might increase the number of planned vaginal births, which may reduce costs. This is likely to be partly offset by the fact that a proportion of these women would go on to give birth by caesarean section for one or both twins.\n【556】 Return to recommendations\n【557】 # Fetal monitoring during labour in twin pregnancy\n【558】 Recommendations 1.11.1 to 1.11.21\n【559】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【560】 There was no evidence on the most effective method of fetal monitoring in labour for improving outcomes in women with a twin pregnancy and their babies, so the committee used their expertise and experience along with NICE guidance on fetal monitoring in singleton pregnancy (NICE's guideline on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies) to make recommendations. They agreed that clinically it is well recognised that twins are at increased risk of complications during labour, especially the second twin, so they recommended continuous fetal monitoring. Continuous cardiotocography monitoring is the only modality that can assess both twin fetal heart rates simultaneously during established labour.\n【561】 The committee agreed on the importance of explaining to women the lack of evidence about monitoring with cardiotocography specifically in twins, and that recommendations are based on NICE guidance for singleton pregnancy (intrapartum care for healthy women and babies). Healthcare professionals should provide a detailed explanation of what cardiotocography involves and why it is used and give women a chance to discuss their wishes and concerns. Recommending this before 28 weeks gives women time to make an informed decision and takes into account the fact that many twins are born prematurely.\n【562】 The committee recommended offering continuous cardiotocography to women in established labour with a twin pregnancy over 26 weeks because at this gestational age, neonatal survival rates improve and the risks of neonatal morbidity from preterm birth are falling. The advantages of using cardiotocography over intermittent auscultation monitoring include the ability to assess baseline variability and monitor continuously.\n【563】 Performing a portable ultrasound (bedside) scan at the start of established labour not only helps to confirm which is the first and which the second twin and locate the fetal hearts but  confirms presentation – malpresentation is more common in twin pregnancy than singleton pregnancy and an emergency caesarean section may be indicated if the first twin presents in the breech position.\n【564】 The committee recommended involving a senior obstetrician to decide how twins are monitored in established extreme premature labour (23+0 to 25+6 weeks of pregnancy) in line with NICE's guideline on premature labour and birth in singleton pregnancies.\n【565】 The committee recommended dual channel monitors to make sure both fetal heart rates could be monitored and displayed accurately at the same time on the same record during labour. Maternal pulse monitoring should be displayed on the same continuous cardiotocography trace to ensure 2 fetal heart rates were being recorded (without mistaking the maternal heart rate for a fetal heart rate).\n【566】 The committee recommended classifying and interpreting cardiotocography in a way that is broadly consistent with the NICE guideline on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies, but with additional considerations specific to twins. These include regarding twin pregnancy as a fetal clinical risk factor when classifying a cardiotocograph finding as 'abnormal' or 'non-reassuring'. This would result in a lower threshold for classifying a cardiotocograph as pathological.\n【567】 Failing to successfully monitor one or both babies could lead to adverse perinatal outcomes so the committee recommended involving a senior healthcare professional. They  recommended applying a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby if abdominal monitoring is unsuccessful or there are concerns about synchronicity of the fetal hearts. This should only be carried out after 34 weeks of pregnancy and if there are no contraindications such as HIV, hepatitis or maternal thrombocytopenia.\n【568】 If there is 'suspicious' cardiotocography in the first baby during established labour, the committee recommended involving a senior healthcare professional to help manage reversible causes such as dehydration, infection or positional loss of contact, before applying a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby (in the absence of contraindications) while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby.\n【569】 In case of 'pathological' cardiotocography in the first baby, a senior healthcare professional should discuss with the woman using fetal blood sampling in the first baby if the benefits are likely to outweigh the potential risks – these include avoiding a second-stage caesarean section, which increases maternal morbidity and mortality.\n【570】 After the first baby is born, cardiotocographic monitoring of the second baby should continue to detect any 'suspicious' or 'pathological' cardiotocography that could lead to the need for a caesarean section.\n【571】 The committee did not make recommendations for women with a triplet pregnancy because most of these women give birth by caesarean section. Monitoring in labour would therefore be rare and decisions would be made on an individual basis.\n【572】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【573】 The recommendations are consistent with the NICE guideline on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies taking into account the twin-specific measures. It is not anticipated that the recommendations will lead to major changes in current clinical practice.\n【574】 Return to recommendations\n【575】 # Analgesia\n【576】 Recommendations 1.12.1 to 1.12.3\n【577】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【578】 There is limited evidence on analgesia in labour for women with a twin pregnancy, and no evidence for women with a triplet pregnancy, so the committee used their expertise and experience along with the very limited evidence to make recommendations. They agreed that there is variation in practice in relation to when healthcare professionals discuss analgesia and anaesthesia with women and what they should discuss, so they specified when this should happen during pregnancy and what to cover.\n【579】 Women with a twin or triplet pregnancy have an increased risk of intervention in labour, including assisted birth or caesarean section for one or more of the babies, and additional internal manoeuvres. Having an epidural in place allows analgesia or anaesthesia to be given quickly when it is needed, reducing the potential need for emergency general anaesthesia.\n【580】 The limited evidence suggested that having an epidural in place  reduces the need for emergency caesarean section for the second twin after vaginal birth of the first twin, possibly by allowing more effective internal manoeuvres to allow the second twin to be born vaginally.\n【581】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【582】 The recommendations reinforce current best practice.\n【583】 Return to recommendations\n【584】 # Managing the third stage of labour\n【585】 Recommendations 1.13.1 to 1.13.9\n【586】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【587】 The evidence was very limited, so the committee used their clinical expertise and experience to make recommendations. Multiple pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum haemorrhage  NICE's guideline on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies) because of over-distension of the uterus and enlarged placenta(s). The committee agreed that healthcare professionals should explain this to women in the antenatal period and assess and re-evaluate each woman's individual risk as her pregnancy progresses.\n【588】 Because of the risk of postpartum haemorrhage, the committee agreed that active management of the third stage of labour using uterotonics should be offered to all women, and physiological management should not be offered.\n【589】 It is already well-established as current practice and is supported by the committee's experience that when women have more than 1 risk factor for postpartum haemorrhage, additional uterotonics can reduce this risk. There is no clear evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different uterotonics in twin or triplet pregnancy. Each uterotonic has risk factors and contraindications, so the committee did not recommend a specific one.\n【590】 The committee agreed on the importance of having existing intravenous access and blood products readily available in case a postpartum haemorrhage does occur.\n【591】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【592】 The recommendations reinforce current best practice.\n【593】 Return to recommendations# Context\n【594】 Twins or triplets occur in approximately 1 in 60 pregnancies (16 in every 1,000 women giving birth in 2015 had a multiple birth), and 3% of live-born babies are from multiple gestations. The incidence of multiple births has risen in the past 30 years. This is due mainly to increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and  to changing demographics as women defer pregnancy and twins are more common at later ages (102 in every 1,000 women giving birth in 2015 were aged 45 or over).\n【595】 Women with a twin or triplet pregnancy are at higher risk compared with women with a singleton pregnancy. Adverse outcomes are more likely, both for the woman and her babies, during the prenatal and intrapartum periods. Because of this, women need increased monitoring and more contact with healthcare professionals during their pregnancy.\n【596】 Assessment and planning start as soon as the twin or triplet pregnancy is detected and continue throughout pregnancy at each antenatal contact. Determining the chorionicity and amnionicity of the pregnancy allows the risk to be stratified and the number of antenatal visits and ultrasound examinations to be planned. It is important that ultrasound surveillance is carefully scheduled to monitor for complications including selective fetal growth restriction, feto-fetal transfusion syndrome and twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS).\n【597】 Identifying complications earlier means that decisions can be made promptly about referring the woman to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre. It  informs discussions with women in their second and third trimesters about their hopes and wishes in relation to timing and mode of birth, and the management of the intrapartum period (including fetal monitoring, analgesia and the third stage of labour).\n【598】 This guideline replaces the previous NICE guideline on multiple pregnancy (CG. The surveillance process found new evidence and identified a need to include intrapartum care, an area that was not included in the original guideline. In current practice, a significant proportion of multiple pregnancy losses occur intrapartum and the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes is greater in multiple than in singleton pregnancies.\n【599】 The guideline updates recommendations on screening and monitoring for selective fetal growth restriction and feto-fetal transfusion syndrome, and makes new recommendations on screening and monitoring for TAPS; screening for and preventing preterm birth; and timing of birth. New recommendations on intrapartum care cover mode of birth, fetal monitoring, analgesia and managing the third stage of labour.\n", "seq_id": 1736, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#4#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-18 23:09:52"}

Open or blind adhesiolysis may be considered for neurological or persistent symptoms unresponsive to conservative treatment.\n【12】 # Outline of the procedure\n【13】 Endoscopic division of epidural adhesions aims to reduce or eliminate pain related to adhesions around spinal nerves.\n【14】 The procedure is carried out with the patient under local anaesthesia and mild sedation. The epidural space is accessed at the appropriate level using fluoroscopic guidance, and a guidewire and endoscope are inserted. The epidural space is distended by injection of saline. Endoscopic manipulation is used to identify painful nerve roots (by communication with the patient). Endoscopic instruments are used to divide epidural adhesions around the spinal nerve roots or the spinal cord.\n【15】 Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n【16】 # Efficacy\n【17】 A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 83 patients treated by the procedure or diagnostic endoscopy alone (control group), reported a greater pain improvement from baseline (using a 10-point visual analogue scale ; lower scores indicate less pain) in the treatment (9.0 to 5. compared with the control group (8.9 to 8. at 12-month follow-up (p = 0.001 both for improvement from baseline and for between group comparisons).\n【18】 In a comparative case series of 183 patients treated by the procedure, patients with previous nerve decompression had significantly less leg and low-back pain at 3-month follow-up compared with those without such history (p < 0..\n【19】 The RCT of 83 patients reported a significant improvement from baseline in mean Oswestry Disability Index score (functional ability questionnaire with scores from 0%  to 100% ) in the treatment group, from 36% at baseline to 25% at 12-month follow-up (p = 0.. This compares with improvement in the control group from 34% to 33% (p = 0.001 compared with the treatment group).\n【20】 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as pain relief, improved function and disability score, quality of life, psychological status, return to work and avoidance of spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain.\n【21】 # Safety\n【22】 Dural puncture was reported in 3% (4/ and 2% (1/ of patients in the case series of 183 and a case series of 58 patients, and in 1 patient in a case report. Contrast medium leakage into the cerebrospinal fluid space was  reported in this case report (causing postoperative rhabdomyolysis and acute encephalopathy; patient recovered after 20 hours, was able to walk after 24 hours and recovered fully).\n【23】 In a case series of 120 patients, subarachnoid puncture and subarachnoid block (potentially leading to neural damage, including paralysis) were reported in 12% (7/ and 7% (4/ of patients treated by the procedure and 7% (4/ and 3% (2/ of patients treated by non-endoscopic (radiologically guided) division of adhesions (timing of events not stated). The RCT of 83 patients reported 1 case of postoperative subarachnoid block in the intervention group (treated with steroids and resolved without sequelae).\n【24】 Visual disturbance (clinical significance and degree and speed of resolution not described) was recorded in 12 patients in a safety report on visual impairment because of retinal haemorrhage, treated by epidural injection, epiduroscopy or lysis of adhesions (denominator not stated). An additional case report described blurred vision and bilateral central scotomas immediately after the procedure (which resolved spontaneously within 2 months) in 1 patient.\n【25】 'Non-persistent' lower limb paraesthesia was reported in 2 patients in the case series of 38 patients (timing and resolution of the event not stated).\n【26】 The Specialist Advisers considered theoretical adverse events to include catheter shearing, nerve root avulsion, nerve palsy, meningitis, arachnoiditis, paralysis, epidural infection or abscess and excessive epidural hydrostatic pressure associated with injection of fluid which could cause events such as spinal compression and haematoma. They listed anecdotal adverse events as numbness in the lower limbs and blindness.# Further information\n【27】 This guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed audit support (which is for use at local discretion).\n【28】 For related NICE guidance see our website.\n【29】 # Information for patients\n【30】 NICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance').

If diazepam is reduced with LAH as in Ex 9, actually the product produced is 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine, not medazepam.\n【7】 A second way of making medazepam consists of the initial reduction of the carbonyl group by lithium aluminum hydride into 7-chloro-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one—the first intermediate product in the synthesis of diazepam—which is synthesized by the cyclocondensation of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone with glycine ethyl ester into 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine, and the subsequent methylation of the secondary amine nitrogen atom of the resulting product by methyl iodide, using sodium hydride as a base.\n【8】 A third method of making medazepam consists of a new way of making 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine, which consists in heterocyclization of\n【9】 1--1-phenylimine is synthesized by the reaction of 2,5-dichlorobenzonitrile\n【10】 with phenylmagnesium bromide.\n【11】 A fourth method of making medazepam from 4-chloro-N-methylaniline is suggested. The last is reacted with aziridine (or ethylene imine) in the presence of aluminum chloride, giving N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-methylethylenediamine.  Acylation of the resulting product with BzCl gives the respective amide, which cyclizes into the desired medazepam using phosphorus oxychloride.\n【12】 A fifth method  exists:\n", "seq_id": 30160, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#12#12#没表述完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-19 02:15:17"}

When widespread vaccination is used, the risk for an unvaccinated  pregnant patient to be exposed to a related infection is low, allowing for postponement, in general, of routine vaccinations to the postpartum period.\n【3】 Nevertheless, immunization during pregnancy may occur either inadvertently, or be indicated in a special situation, when it appears prudent to reduce the risk of a specific disease for a potentially exposed pregnant woman or her fetus.\n【4】 As a rule of thumb the vaccination with live virus or bacteria is contraindicated in pregnancy.\n【5】 # Live attenuated virus vaccine\n【6】 In general, the administration of live attenuated virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, this includes vaccines against measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, rubella, yellow fever, and varicella. It should be noted, that cases of fetal damage due to the inadvertent administration of these vaccines has not been confirmed. Also, no case of congenital rubella syndrome has been reported when rubella vaccine was given inadvertently during a pregnancy. MMR vaccination can be given during lactation and does not affect the baby.\n【7】 The CDC recommends that non-pregnant women who receive the MMR vaccine or varicella vaccination should wait four weeks before getting pregnant.\n【8】 # Inactivated or assembled virus vaccine\n【9】 In situations where inactivated virus or parts of a virus are administered, in general, there is no contraindication to immunization during pregnancy. Thus influenza vaccination is given to pregnant women at risk, as are vaccinations against hepatitis A and B. In the case of rabies vaccination, information is very limited.\n【10】 HPV vaccine was recently introduced. It has no indication and is not to be used during pregnancy.

{"id": 713055, "user_id": "65e7dd234a08e7753ad36f9f", "user_name": " 黄艳玲", "task_id": 316, "source_info": {"text": "【0】 Lithium\n【1】 # Overview\n【2】 Lithium is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3.   It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements.  Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element.  Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable.  For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil.  When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish.  Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, which are usually ionic.  Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays.  On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n【3】 The nuclei of lithium verge on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides.  Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light in atomic weight. For related reasons, lithium has important links to nuclear physics.  The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium-6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\n【4】 Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, high strength-to-weight alloys used in aircraft, lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries.  These uses consume more than half of lithium production.\n【5】 Trace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms.  The element serves no apparent vital biological function, since animals and plants survive in good health without it.  Non-vital functions have not been ruled out.  The lithium ion Li+ administered as any of several lithium salts has proved to be useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder, due to neurological effects of the ion in the human body.\n【6】 ## Atomic and Physical\n【7】 Like the other alkali metals, lithium has a single valence electron that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, it is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though the least reactive of the alkali metals.  Lithium's low reactivity compared to other alkali metals is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in lithium's 1s orbital and are much lower in energy, and therefore they do not participate in chemical bonds).\n【8】 Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife.  When cut, it possesses a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray due to oxidation. While it has one of the lowest melting points among all metals (180 °C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.\n【9】 Lithium has a very low density of 0.534 g/cm3, comparable with that of pine wood.  It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature, the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm being more than 60% denser.  Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only 2/3 as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm. Lithium  can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.\n【10】 Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. It has the highest specific heat capacity of any solid element.  Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa) At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations.  At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic.  At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is the most prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been reported for lithium at high pressures.\n【11】 Lithium has a specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications.\n【12】 ## Chemistry and compounds\n【13】 Lithium reacts with water easily, but with noticeably less energy than other alkali metals do.  The reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually stored under cover of a hydrocarbon, often petroleum jelly.  Though the heavier alkali metals can be stored in more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO.\n【14】 When placed over a flame, lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color, but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver.  Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals.  The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent, as the hydrogen produced will not ignite on its own.  As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers, specifically the Class D type  Types of extinguishing agents).  Lithium is the only metal which reacts with nitrogen under normal conditions.\n【15】 Lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium, an element of similar atomic and ionic radius.  Chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with N2, the formation of an oxide (Li2O) and peroxide (Li2O when burnt in O2, salts with similar solubilities, and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides. The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride (LiH).\n【16】 Other known binary compounds include the halides (LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI), and the sulfide (Li2S), the superoxide (LiO, carbide (Li2C.  Many other inorganic compounds are known, where lithium combines with anions to form various salts: borates, amides, carbonate, nitrate, or borohydride (LiBH.  Multiple organolithium reagents are known where there is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms effectively creating a carbanion.  These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles.  In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures.\n【17】 ## Isotopes\n【18】 Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon compared to the next lighter and heavier elements, helium and beryllium, which means that alone among stable light elements, lithium can produce net energy through nuclear fission.  The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3.  As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.\n【19】 Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms.  All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms.  The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.\n【20】 7Li is one of the primordial elements (or, more properly, primordial nuclides) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  A small amount of both 6Li and 7Li are produced in stars, but are thought to be burned as fast as produced. Additional small amounts of lithium of both 6Li and 7Li may be generated from solar wind, cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms, and from early solar system 7Be and 10Be radioactive decay. While lithium is created in stars during the Stellar nucleosynthesis, it is further burnt.  7Li can  be generated in carbon stars.\n【21】 Lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange.  Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration.  The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo.  The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes.\n【22】 Nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics uses are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent as to slightly but measurably change the 6Li to 7Li ratios even in natural sources, such as rivers.  This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.\n【23】 ## Astronomical\n【24】 According to modern cosmological theory, lithium—as both of its stable isotopes lithium-6 and lithium-7—was among the 3 elements synthesized in the Big Bang. Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a \"cosmological lithium discrepancy\" in the Universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have far more.  The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \"mixing\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed. Furthermore, lithium is produced in younger stars.  Though it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than predicted in later-generation stars, for causes not yet completely understood.\n【25】 Though it was one of the three first elements (together with helium and hydrogen) to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron are markedly less abundant than other nearby elements.  This is a result of the low temperature necessary to destroy lithium, and a lack of common processes to produce it.\n【26】 Lithium is  found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars.  Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \"lithium test\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun. Certain orange stars can  contain a high concentration of lithium.  Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X- orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.\n【27】 ## Terrestrial\n【28】 Although lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar;\n【29】 higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.\n【30】 Estimates for crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, with the largest concentrations in granites.  Granitic pegmatites  provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20 mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.\n【31】 According to the Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium, \"Lithium is a comparatively rare element, although it is found in many rocks and some brines, but always in very low concentrations.  There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value.  Many are very small, others are too low in grade.\"\n【32】 One of the largest reserve base of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia, which has 5.4 million tonnes.  US Geological Survey, estimates that in 2010 Chile had the largest reserves by far (7.5 million tonnes) and the highest annual production .  Other major suppliers include Australia, Argentina and China.\n【33】 In June 2010, the New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there.  \"Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large as those of Bolivia, which now has the world's largest known lithium reserves.\" These estimates are \"based principally on old data, which was gathered mainly by the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan from 1979–1989\" and \"Stephen Peters, the head of the USGS's Afghanistan Minerals Project, said that he was unaware of USGS involvement in any new surveying for minerals in Afghanistan in the past two years.  'We are not aware of any discoveries of lithium,' he said.\"\n【34】 ## Biological\n【35】 Lithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb).  In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids have been found to contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial ones. It is not known whether lithium has a physiological role in any of these organisms, but nutritional studies in mammals have indicated its importance to health, leading to a suggestion that it be classed as an essential trace element with an RDA of 1 mg/day. Observational studies in Japan, reported in 2011, suggested that naturally occurring lithium in drinking water may increase human lifespan.\n【36】 # History of discovery and use\n【37】 Petalite (LiAlSi4O was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist and statesman José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden. However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore. This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline. Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name \"lithion/lithina\", from the Greek word λιθoς (transliterated as lithos, meaning \"stone\"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood.  He named the metal inside the material \"lithium\".\n【38】 Arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande  described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure henceforth led to commercial production of lithium, beginning in 1923, by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n【39】 The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history.  The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines or similar applications in World War II and shortly after.  This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps.  The small market for lithium soaps and the lubricating greases based upon them was supported by several small mining operations mostly in the United States.\n【40】 The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons.  Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride.  The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s.  At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide.  The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some \"natural sources\" of lithium ion which had been \"contaminated\" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.\n【41】 Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s.  After the end of the nuclear arms race the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. But in the mid-1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive method than underground or even open-pit mining.  Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials as only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price.  For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the turn of the 21st century.\n【42】 The use in lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007. With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s, new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand.\n【43】 Lithium toxicity must be differentiated from other causes of hypercalcaemia\n【44】 Lithium toxicity must be differentiated from other causes of diabetes insipidus.\n【45】 # Production\n【46】 Since the end of World War II lithium production has greatly increased.  The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals such as those above.  Lithium salts are extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools and brine deposits.  The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450o C. In 1998 it was about 95 US$ / kg (or 43 US$/pound).\n【47】 Worldwide identified reserves of lithium in 2008 were estimated by the US Geological Survey as 13 million tonnes.  Deposits of lithium are found in South America throughout the Andes mountain chain.  Chile is the leading lithium producer, followed by Argentina.  Both countries recover the lithium from brine pools.  In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada. However, half the world's known reserves are located in Bolivia, a nation sitting along the central eastern slope of the Andes.\n【48】 In 2009 Bolivia was negotiating with Japanese, French, and Korean firms to begin extraction. According to the US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Uyuni Desert has 5.4 million tonnes of lithium. A newly discovered deposit in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated at 228,000 tons.  Additional deposits in the same formation were extrapolated to be as much as 18 million tons.\n【49】 After an industry wide pricing reduction for lithium carbonate after the Great Financial Crisis, where major suppliers such as Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM) dropped pricing by 20% in light of incoming lithium resource developers and to further defend their market position, pricing in 2012 scaled up due to increased lithium demand.  A 2012 Business Week article outlined the existing oligopoly in the lithium space, \"SQM, controlled by billionaire Julio Ponce, is the second-largest, followed by Rockwood, which is backed by Henry Kravis’s KKR & Co., and Philadelphia-based FMC.\" Global consumption may jump to 300,000 metric tons a year by 2020 from about 150,000 tons in 2012, as demand for lithium batteries has been growing at about 25 percent a year, outpacing the 4 percent to 5 percent overall gain in lithium\n【50】 A potential source is geothermal wells.   Geothermal fluids carry leachates to the surface; recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field.  As the lithium is separated by simple filtration techniques, the process and environmental costs are primarily that of the already-operating geothermal well; relative environmental impacts may thus be positive.\n【51】 There are differing opinions about the potential growth of lithium production.  According to a 2011 study conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles.  The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.\n【52】 However, another study concluded that \"realistically achievable lithium carbonate production will be sufficient for only a small fraction of future PHEV and EV global market requirements\", that \"demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade\", and that \"mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound, it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that LiIon propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the 'Green Car'.\n【53】 ## Ceramics and glass\n【54】 Lithium oxide is a widely used flux for processing silica, reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes of improved physical properties including low coefficients for thermal expansion. Lithium oxides are a component of ovenware.  Worldwide, this is the single largest use for lithium compounds.  Lithium carbonate (Li2CO is generally used in this application: upon heating it converts to the oxide.\n【55】 ## Electrical and electronics\n【56】 In the later years of the 20th century, owing to its high electrochemical potential, lithium became an important component of the electrolyte and of one of the electrodes in batteries.  A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells.  Because of its low atomic mass, it  has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio.  Lithium batteries are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as an anode. Lithium batteries are not to be confused with lithium-ion batteries, which are high energy-density rechargeable batteries.  Other rechargeable batteries include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.\n【57】 ## Lubricating greases\n【58】 The third most common use of lithium is in greases.  Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate.  Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.\n【59】 ## Metallurgy\n【60】 When used as a flux for welding or soldering, metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities.  Its fusing quality is  important as a flux for producing ceramics, enamels and glass.  Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make high-performance aircraft parts   Lithium-aluminium alloys).\n【61】 ### Pyrotechnics\n【62】 Lithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.\n【63】 ### Air purification\n【64】 Lithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams.  Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification.  Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.\n【65】 Lithium peroxide (Li2O in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but  releases oxygen. The reaction is as follows:\n【66】 Some of the aforementioned compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen.  These can  include small amounts of boron, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.\n【67】 ### Optics\n【68】 Lithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications.  It has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the farthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.\n【69】 The high non-linearity of lithium niobate  makes it useful in non-linear optics applications.  It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals.  Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.\n【70】 ### Organic and polymer chemistry\n【71】 Organolithium compounds are widely used in the production of polymer and fine-chemicals.  In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.  Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.\n【72】 Many other lithium compounds are used as reagents to prepare organic compounds.   Some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH, lithium triethylborohydride (LiBH(C2H.\n【73】 ### Military applications\n【74】 Metallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as Li, are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants. Lithium aluminum hydride can  be used by itself as a solid fuel.\n【75】 The Mark 50 Torpedo stored chemical energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium.  The reaction generates heat which is used to generate steam.  The steam propels the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle.\n【76】 Lithium hydride containing lithium-6 is used in hydrogen bombs.  In the bomb, it is placed around the core of an atomic bomb.\n【77】 ## Nuclear\n【78】 Lithium-6 is valued as a source material for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion.  Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.\n【79】 Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb.  When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test.  Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve.  Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride still apparently plays a role in modern nuclear weapons, as a fusion material.\n【80】 Lithium fluoride, when highly enriched in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors.  Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have low melting points.  In addition, 7Li, Be, and F are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.\n【81】 In conceptualized nuclear fusion power plants, lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel.  Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium:\n【82】 Lithium is  used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei.  When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed, which undergoes fission to form two alpha particles.  This feat, called \"splitting the atom\" at the time, was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction.  It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932. (Nuclear reactions and human-directed nuclear transmutation had been accomplished as early as 1917, but by using natural radioactive bombardment with alpha particles).\n【83】 ## Medicine\n【84】 In the treatment of bipolar disorder, lithium compounds are used.  Lithium salts may  be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression.  The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li+. There have been suggestions of increased risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women taking lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n【85】 # Precautions\n【86】 Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact.  Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate the nose and throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.  The metal itself is a handling hazard because of the caustic hydroxide produced when it is in contact with moisture.  Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.\n【87】 ## Regulation\n【88】 Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers.  Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia.\n【89】 Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway.  Most consumer lithium batteries have thermal overload protection built-in to prevent this type of incident, or their design inherently limits short-circuit currents.  Internal shorts have been known to develop due to manufacturing defects or damage to batteries that can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.\n", "seq_id": 31943, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:03:25"}

For example, it does not evaluate use of FibroScan outside secondary and specialist care to allow widespread screening for early liver disease. The recommendation for its use outside secondary and specialist care does not affect who should have testing as recommended in national guidelines.\n【4】 FibroScan is recommended as an option for assessing liver fibrosis or cirrhosis outside secondary and specialist care if:\n【5】 each FibroScan device is expected to be used for at least 500 scans per year, typically requiring use in locations which cover larger populations, such as community diagnostic hubs\n【6】 this is likely to improve access to testing for underserved groups\n【7】 it is used in accordance with national guidelines  sections 2.3 to 2.\n【8】 a clear care pathway with guidance for healthcare professionals doing the test on what to do based on a FibroScan result is established locally through collaboration between primary or community care and secondary or specialist care providers\n【9】 there is training for healthcare professionals on how to do the test, and\n【10】 the company provides supporting materials to make sure people using the test continue to use it correctly.\n【11】 Why the committee made these recommendations\n【12】 Using FibroScan to assess liver fibrosis and cirrhosis outside secondary and specialist care has the potential to detect liver disease earlier. Providing tests at locations that are closer to more people who need them may improve access and attendance at appointments. This may  reduce health inequalities for people from underserved groups (such as disabled people, people living in rural areas or people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds).\n【13】 This assessment did not assess wider use of FibroScan than what is currently recommended in national guidelines  sections 2.3 to 2.. It only considered changing the location of testing and therefore FibroScan is only recommended for use outside secondary and specialist care in line with national guidelines. To maintain test performance, testing should be done as part of a clear care pathway. Also, training on doing the test should be provided and trained operators should use the device frequently to maintain their expertise.\n【14】 There is some uncertainty about the overall long-term costs of using the test outside secondary and specialist care. But, it is likely that if each device is used frequently, the immediate costs of doing a test in the community will be lower than the cost of referring a person for testing in secondary or specialist care. So, FibroScan is recommended as an option for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis outside secondary and specialist care.# The diagnostic test\n【15】 # Clinical need and practice\n【16】 Liver fibrosis happens when persistent inflammation of the liver causes excessive scar tissue to build up in the organ and nearby blood vessels. The presence of scar tissue can impair overall liver function and limit blood flow which may lead to the death of liver cells. Advanced liver fibrosis can develop into cirrhosis, liver failure, portal hypertension and possibly needing a liver transplant. Liver fibrosis is caused by hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease.\n【17】 Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease that happens when inflammation and fibrosis has spread throughout the liver and disrupts the shape and function of the liver. Cirrhosis usually develops silently after exposure to 1 or more risk factors such as alcohol misuse and hepatitis B or C which cause inflammation in the liver, or obesity. But, not everyone with inflammation of the liver will eventually develop cirrhosis. Untreated cirrhosis can cause liver failure, liver cancer or death.\n【18】 NICE's guideline on assessing and managing cirrhosis in over 16s recommends using transient elastography to diagnose cirrhosis in people with hepatitis C, high alcohol consumption, diagnosed alcohol-related liver disease, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease advanced fibrosis.\n【19】 NICE's guideline on diagnosing and managing chronic hepatitis B recommends transient elastography as an initial test for liver disease in adults newly referred for assessment and for the annual reassessment of liver disease in adults who are not taking antiviral treatment.\n【20】 NICE's guideline on assessing and managing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease states that the enhanced liver fibrosis test should be considered for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to test for advanced liver fibrosis. Clinical experts highlighted that this test is not available everywhere, and FibroScan is often used instead of, or alongside, the enhanced liver fibrosis test. This is consistent with the British Society of Gastroenterology's guidance on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and guidance on diagnosing and monitoring non-alcoholic fatty liver disease published in the British Medical Journal.\n【21】 # The intervention\n【22】 ## FibroScan used outside secondary and specialist care\n【23】 FibroScan (Echosens) is a non-invasive medical device that assesses liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by measuring the degree of liver stiffness. It can distinguish normal liver or minimal fibrosis from cirrhotic livers.\n【24】 FibroScan uses proprietary vibration-controlled transient elastography to quantify liver stiffness, which is essentially a measure of the extent of liver scarring.\n【25】 There are multiple products in the FibroScan range with different features, but all measure liver stiffness using transient elastography. The full list of devices can be found in  of the scope.\n【26】 Different sizes of probes (small, medium or extra-large) are available. The device comes with a medium probe. Small and extra-large probes are optional extras. The extra-large probe is designed to enhance signal penetration through deeper tissues, reducing device failure rates in people with obesity.\n【27】 In this assessment, the intervention is FibroScan used outside secondary and specialist care. The population tested included only those who would have FibroScan in line with current NHS practice. The assessment focused on where the test should be done, rather than who should have the test.\n【28】 Submissions provided by the company were based on the cost of the FibroScan 430 Mini+ at £48,000 both within and outside of secondary and specialist care settings.\n【29】 # The comparator\n【30】 ## FibroScan used in secondary or specialist care\n【31】 The comparator is FibroScan used in the same way as the intervention, but in secondary or specialist care.# Committee discussion\n【32】 The diagnostics advisory committee considered evidence on FibroScan for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis from several sources, including an external assessment report and an overview of that report. Full details are in the project documents for this guidance.\n【33】 # Increased access to FibroScan may improve early detection of liver disease\n【34】 Liver disease is a significant and growing cause of mortality in the UK and is often asymptomatic in early stages. Clinical experts explained that bringing FibroScan testing closer to people who need it improves attendance at appointments which could help with earlier detection of liver disease. They highlighted that there is a need to enable early detection of liver disease to reduce the number of cases being identified late in the disease course, and that fibrosis is reversible at early stages. Clinical experts commented that people generally have a positive experience with FibroScan and could be motivated by the test results to make behavioural changes that can reverse the course of their liver disease if detected early. But, they clarified that there was no evidence showing long-term behavioural change after FibroScan use.\n【35】 ## There may be benefits to local testing\n【36】 Patient experts reported that people often travel long distances to access FibroScan, especially in rural areas. Easier access to the test could reduce time and costs associated with this. It could help people attend the test in a more familiar environment. It could  help people with disabilities that make it difficult to travel. Patient experts commented that needing to travel longer distances could be a particular barrier for people from lower socioeconomic groups, who may be at higher risk of liver disease and typically die from the condition much earlier. The committee commented that the benefits outlined may not be seen if multiple appointments are needed to first do the scan and then separately deliver lifestyle advice. Clinical experts responded that lifestyle interventions are often delivered by healthcare assistants or nurses, and that any advice needed based on a FibroScan result would be given in the same appointment as the scan was done  section 3.. Clinical experts further commented that the increasing prevalence of liver disease means that secondary care services risk being overwhelmed, and that moving some aspects of care like FibroScan testing to alternative settings could help manage the workload. The extent to which making FibroScan available outside of secondary and specialist care would improve access to testing depends on which locations testing is made available, and what transport links are available (compared with transport links to secondary or specialist care).\n【37】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【38】 ## There is no data comparing the performance of FibroScan when used in alternative settings with its use in secondary or specialist care\n【39】 There was no evidence comparing the performance of FibroScan for measuring liver fibrosis when it is used in alternative settings with when it is used in secondary or specialist care. At consultation on the draft guidance, the lack of published evidence was confirmed by the company.\n【40】 ## Performance of FibroScan may depend on the experience of the user\n【41】 Clinical experts explained that how well FibroScan works depends on the experience of the user. They stated that if FibroScan is used often enough to make sure it is being used correctly, performance between different care settings would be comparable.\n【42】 ## There is no evidence on how often FibroScan would need to be used to maintain competence\n【43】 The committee considered the level of use that would be needed for users to maintain competence with FibroScan. The company commented that it encouraged users to make sure that competency is validated in practice, but that it does not currently provide guidance on requirements for the level of use. Clinical experts highlighted that there is no independent accreditation scheme for users, and that this is  the case for tests done in secondary or specialist care. They explained that FibroScan users outside secondary or specialist care in their areas had close links with local hepatology departments which could provide support when needed. The company explained that pilot schemes in primary care networks typically saw 20 to 30 people a month. The committee noted that it is unclear how many FibroScan tests are currently done in the NHS  section 3.. Clinical experts highlighted that there is no clear evidence to define a number or frequency of tests that need to be done to achieve and maintain expertise. The committee considered that sufficient levels of use may not be achieved if the test was available in individual GP practice populations, but use in services that cover larger populations, such as community diagnostic hubs or across a primary care network, would likely mean the users do enough tests to be sure it is being used correctly. The committee concluded that if used outside secondary or specialist care, it would be important to make sure that operators used FibroScan often enough to be able to accurately use the test, and for centres to consider having an accreditation framework in place.\n【44】 ## FibroScan can be done by any healthcare professional if they are suitably trained\n【45】 Clinical experts commented that FibroScan is relatively simple to use, that it indicates if the test has not worked, and that all grades of staff can use the technology if appropriately trained. At consultation, the company proposed several measures they could introduce to make sure that user competency is maintained after the initial training. These included developing a competency checklist and framework for annual assessment, offering on-site assessment, developing online competency assessments, or getting continuing professional development accreditation for FibroScan training. The committee agreed these would be valuable and would build confidence in test results. The committee concluded that if these measures were put in place, it would give reassurance that FibroScan assessment done outside secondary or specialist care would be done effectively.\n【46】 ## With appropriate training and quality assurance, and frequent use, FibroScan can be done effectively outside secondary or specialist care\n【47】 The committee recalled that there was no data directly comparing the performance of FibroScan tests done in, or outside, secondary or specialist care  section 3.. But, if the test was done in an alternative setting where appropriately trained operators do enough scans to maintain their expertise  section 3., the committee concluded that it was likely that test performance could be maintained outside of secondary or specialist care, if there are ongoing measures to ensure quality such as those proposed by the company  section 3..\n【48】 ## There was concern that greater availability of FibroScan outside secondary and specialist care could lead to wider use\n【49】 The committee recalled that the population in this assessment was restricted to those who would have FibroScan as in current NHS practice  section 2.. The test was only assessed for use in people it is already recommended for. It noted that performance of the test would depend on the population being tested, and that the value of testing would depend on the availability and effectiveness of interventions for the population tested, based on test results. Some consultation comments mentioned a potential benefit of FibroScan outside secondary or specialist care may be that it allows for wider screening for early liver disease. The committee noted that such use had not been assessed in this guidance and expressed concern that using FibroScan outside secondary or specialist care could lead to its use in a wider population than assessed, which could in turn affect its performance. It concluded that if recommended, the test should only be used as recommended in national guidelines  sections 2.3 to 2..\n【50】 ## FibroScan should be used as part of a clear care pathway\n【51】 Clinical experts and committee members emphasised that clear guidance on what to do with the results of FibroScan is vital, particularly if testing is done outside a specialist setting. FibroScan done in alternative settings could reduce the number of unnecessary referrals to hepatology services. But, if there is uncertainty about what to do based on a result, a referral to specialist services, or contact with these services to ask advice, may still be made. Clinical experts highlighted that this could happen often if multiple conflicting test results (including FibroScan) were available. Liver pathways should be designed in agreement with primary and secondary care centres, and incorporate all tests used for detection and characterisation of liver disease, not just FibroScan. The committee concluded that establishing clear care pathways, with guidance for healthcare professionals on what to do based on a FibroScan result based on existing national guidelines, would be essential to ensure appropriate clinical management of liver disease in people who have FibroScan tests done outside secondary and specialist care settings.\n【52】 # Cost modelling\n【53】 ## The long-term effects of testing outside secondary and specialist care on costs are uncertain\n【54】 In the base-case analysis provided by the company, the economic model used a 1‑year time horizon. The committee commented that this omits potential costs or cost savings that would only appear many years after testing, such as the costs of treating previously undetected liver disease. The committee noted that increased attendance at FibroScan appointments in primary or community care increased costs in the model, because more people were referred for follow-up appointments in hepatology. But, any potential cost savings or health benefits of greater detection of liver disease were not considered  section 3.. At consultation on the draft guidance, the company submitted a scenario analysis with a 5‑year time horizon, which estimated lower long-term costs of about £30 less per person if testing was done in primary or community care. The external assessment group (EAG) explained that the lower cost was because there were fewer people with missed liver disease if testing was done in primary or community care, because more people attended scans. The committee considered it was unclear what assumptions were made in the modelling to base this on. Company representatives were not able to provide further clarity in the committee meeting. The company's model did not allow people's liver disease to progress in the 5‑year time period modelled. Clinical experts commented that this may not be appropriate for people with alcohol-related liver disease, whose condition can progress at a faster rate. The committee noted that the effect of lifestyle advice may differ depending on who provides it, for example a GP compared with a liver specialist, but experts said that there was no evidence on this. Clinical experts commented that referrals to hepatology services may increase after adopting FibroScan outside secondary and specialist care, but this may mean that more people who would benefit from specialist care are able to access it. Clinical experts  commented there was uncertainty about the long-term effect of using the test outside secondary or specialist care, for example, on levels of hospitalisation. The committee considered it plausible that testing in alternative settings could lead to longer term cost savings but thought that the company analysis did not allow this to be assessed. In advance of the third committee meeting, the company provided a revised model, and accompanying description, of the long-term implications of missing liver disease. This included allowing liver disease to progress within the modelled time period. This led to lower costs if FibroScan was done in primary or community care because increased attendance at scans was assumed to increase detection of liver disease and reduce progression to more severe stages. The EAG questioned the long-term costs used in the model because they came from a study of antiviral treatment for people with chronic hepatitis C  as an alternative source. Some of the results from the updated model provided by the company for the third committee meeting, and further analyses run by the EAG using this model, did indicate that testing in primary or community care reduced long-term costs. Clinical experts said that earlier detection of liver disease could plausibly lead to cost savings. But, the committee  considered that costs could be higher in the long term (although potentially with accompanying improvements in health-related quality of life), particularly if a time frame longer than the 5 years modelled was used. The committee concluded that there is considerable uncertainty about the long-term effect of FibroScan testing outside secondary or specialist care on costs.\n【55】 ## There is uncertainty about the cost per scan in secondary care but the model likely underestimates this cost\n【56】 The committee discussed the costs used in the original model submitted by the company, and the revised costs used by the EAG. The EAG removed a cost from the company's model for staff time to do and evaluate FibroScan in secondary or specialist care because this time was already incorporated within an existing cost used in the model. This meant that, using the figure proposed by the company for testing in this setting, the cost of doing FibroScan was greater per scan when done in primary or community care. Experts agreed that the staff costs of doing the scan would be included in the Health Resource Group (HRG) cost used by the company. The company used HRG bundled costs for ultrasound elastography to estimate the cost of FibroScan in secondary or specialist care, at £43.93 in the base case. This cost was  used by the EAG. The company highlighted that a scenario analysis done by the EAG in which a higher cost per use in secondary or specialist care (£61. was used, based on a weighted average of 2 different costs attributed to the HRG code, and suggested that this might be more appropriate. The EAG commented that the results of this scenario still indicated that using FibroScan outside secondary or specialist care was cost incurring. In their report, the EAG highlighted difficulties in evaluating the costs of doing FibroScan in the different settings that were a consequence of comparing a bundled HRG cost from secondary care with a cost obtained by micro-costing in a non-hospital setting, where a HRG code does not currently exist. The committee noted that the HRG code for ultrasound elastography was used only 3,561 times for outpatients in 2019 to 2020, which likely underestimated the number of FibroScan tests done in the NHS. Further scans may be done during outpatient appointments and recorded using other HRG codes, potentially at higher cost. At consultation, the company provided further analyses. Its base-case analysis kept the higher cost of testing in secondary care, including additional costs for staff time to do the test as well as the HRG code. Analyses using alternative costs were not cost neutral or cost saving for testing done in primary or community care. The company did not provide any further support for their choice of cost used in the base case or rationale for the most appropriate choice of cost for the test in secondary care. The committee  questioned whether the full costs of a referral for testing in secondary or specialist care had been incorporated. Missed appointments were included as a separate cost in the model. A clinical expert commented that the cost of missed appointments was likely to already be captured in the cost of doing scans used in the company's model. If so, including an additional cost for missed appointments was not appropriate. Clinical experts noted that if a person misses an appointment in secondary care, they may need to restart the referral pathway to access FibroScan, incurring further cost. The committee concluded that there was still considerable uncertainty about the costs of testing in secondary care, and suggested further analysis to address this. In advance of the third committee meeting, the company provided further analyses. This included a micro-costing-based estimate of £40.61 for doing FibroScan in secondary care. The number of scans  used to determine this was from a survey of 4 NHS trusts. The EAG noted some limitations in the company's micro-costing approach but stated this was its preferred method for assessing costs. Clinical experts noticed that the company's micro-costing only included costs of doing FibroScan but not the costs of a referral for a hepatologist outpatient appointment that would happen in practice if a GP decided that the scan was needed. The EAG noted that the NHS reference cost for this appointment is £268 (cost in individual trusts may vary). The committee concluded that while there is uncertainty about the exact cost of testing, it is likely that the model underestimates the cost of doing FibroScan in secondary care.\n【57】 ## The extent of use of FibroScan outside secondary or specialist care will affect cost per use\n【58】 The committee noted that the cost the company has provided for FibroScan in primary or community care in their original submission is higher (£58.00 per scan, plus £10.50 for staff time to do the test and evaluate FibroScan result) than the HRG code cost used in the EAG's base case and scenario analysis for FibroScan in secondary or specialist care  section 3.. This was based on a fixed cost being charged by the company per scan, with no upfront cost for the machine. At consultation, the company submitted an alternative costing model in which the FibroScan device was purchased outright, which included a maintenance contract over the assumed 7‑year lifespan of the device. The average cost per scan, calculated assuming 500 scans per year being done based on Southampton clinical commissioning group use, was £34.29 plus staff time to do the test. The EAG did a threshold analysis and found that the device would have to be used at least 300 times a year for this model to be cheaper than the pay-per-scan model originally suggested. The company stated that their intended use of the tests outside secondary or specialist care is in hubs and diagnostic centres, rather than single GP practices, where use would be expected to be higher. The committee agreed that this usage may be achieved if the device was used in primary care networks or community diagnostic hubs  section 3.. But, it noted that only a single estimate of expected use in primary or community care had been provided by the company. The committee recalled that moving FibroScan testing outside secondary and specialist care would potentially move workload to other settings for activities that happen based on test results, such as lifestyle advice, and questioned whether the time taken by healthcare professionals to do this has been adequately captured in costs of doing the test outside secondary and specialist care. They further highlighted that even if a person is not referred to a specialist service after a test done outside this setting, advice from staff in these services may be sought. A clinical expert emphasised that community and primary care staff such as nurses and healthcare assistants are experienced in providing lifestyle and diet advice  section 3. and that any advice could be given in the same appointment as the FibroScan test was done. The committee concluded that there was uncertainty about whether the costs of doing FibroScan outside secondary and community care used in the company's model were an accurate reflection of the true cost of testing. It further noted that if buying the FibroScan device outright, the cost per use would depend on the extent of use, and asked for further information to support estimates of expected use. In advance of the third committee meeting, the company provided further analysis. Using local real-world data and national data sources, the company estimated that 1 FibroScan device shared between 5 primary care networks would be used for 2,500 to 5,000 scans per year. The EAG considered the estimates based on real-world data more robust but stated that using 6 sources of information provided by the company, the EAG found only 1 example where FibroScan was used in as many as 500 to 1,000 people per year per primary care network. But of the 8 clinical experts consulted by the EAG, 5 said sharing 1 device between 5 primary care networks was plausible in some scenarios and all thought a single network would be able to do 500 scans per year. The clinical experts attending the committee meeting supported this view. The committee noted that in its updated submissions, the company had provided the cost per FibroScan done in primary care based on buying the device outright and at least 500 scans per device being done per year (£44., rather than the cost per scan based on a pay-per-scan charging model as in its original submission (£58.00 per scan, plus £10.50 for staff time).\n【59】 ## Using FibroScan in alternative settings is likely to cost less than doing the test in secondary care\n【60】 There is still uncertainty about the true cost of doing a test both in secondary and specialist care  section 3. or outside these settings  section 3.. The committee recalled that it is likely that the model underestimated the cost of testing in secondary care  section 3.. Higher cost of testing in this setting would make testing outside of secondary and specialist care more likely to be cost saving. The committee concluded that, based on buying FibroScan 430 Mini+ outright  section 2. and an expected use of at least 500 scans per year per device as modelled by the company, the immediate costs related to a FibroScan test were likely to be lower outside of secondary and specialist care. The committee  recalled that making sure FibroScan was used enough outside secondary and specialist care was important to make sure operators do enough scans to maintain their expertise  section 3..The committee further recalled that there is considerable uncertainty about the long-term effect on costs of using the test outside secondary and specialist care  section 3.. On balance, the committee concluded that there was enough certainty that the immediate costs of using FibroScan for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis outside secondary and specialist care are likely to be lower than the cost of referring people for testing in secondary or specialist care to allow it to recommend use in this setting.\n【61】 ## It would be beneficial to monitor the effect of FibroScan outside secondary and specialist care to make sure that the expected benefits are seen\n【62】 The committee commented that it would be beneficial to monitor the effect of greater availability of FibroScan outside secondary and specialist care on relevant costs and outcomes to make sure that the proposed benefits are being achieved in practice in the NHS.\n", "seq_id": 1215, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#10#10#接上一条\n缺少换行#14#14#最后一句另起一行\n缺少换行#31#31#最后一句另起一行", "type3": "无关文本#32#32#最后1句与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-18 19:28:28"}

Anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and NSAIDs act by downregulating eicosanoid synthesis.\n【7】 There are four families of eicosanoids—the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, the thromboxanes and the leukotrienes.  For each,  there are two or three separate series, derived either from an ω-3 or ω-6 essential fatty acid.  These series' different activities largely explain the health effects of ω-3 and ω-6 fats.\n【8】 # Nomenclature\n【9】 \"Eicosanoid\"  (eicosa-,  Greek for \"twenty\"; see icosahedron) is the collective term for oxygenated derivatives of three different 20-carbon essential fatty acids:\n【10】 - Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an ω-3 fatty acid with 5 double bonds;\n【11】 - Arachidonic acid (AA), an ω-6 fatty acid, with 4 double bonds;\n【12】 - Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an ω-6, with 3 double bonds.\n【13】 Current usage limits the term  to the leukotrienes (LT) and three types of prostanoids—prostaglandins (PG) prostacyclins (PGI), and  thromboxanes (TX).  This is the definition used in this article.  However, several other classes can technically be termed eicosanoid, including the hepoxilins, resolvins, isofurans, isoprostanes, lipoxins, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and some endocannabinoids.\n【14】 A particular eicosanoid is denoted by a four-character abbreviation, composed of:\n【15】 - Its two letter abbreviation (above),\n【16】 - One A-B-C sequence-letter; and\n【17】 - A subscript, indicating the number of double bonds.\n【18】 Examples are:\n【19】 - The EPA-derived prostanoids have three double bonds, (e.g. PGG3, PGH3, PGI3, TXA while its leukotrienes have five, (LTB.\n【20】 - The AA-derived prostanoids have two double bonds, (e.g. PGG2, PGH2, PGI2, TXA while its leukotrienes have four, (LTB.\n【21】 Two families of enzymes catalyze fatty acid oxygenation to produce the eicosanoids:\n【22】 - Cyclooxygenase, or COX, which comes in at least three isoforms, COX-1, -2, -3  – leading to the prostanoids.\n【23】 - Lipoxygenase, in several forms.  5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) generates the leukotrienes.\n【24】 # Biosynthesis\n【25】 Eicosanoids are a class of oxygenated fatty acids, found widely in a variety of microorganisms, plants and animals.  In humans, eicosanoids are local hormones  that are released by most cells, act on that same cell or nearby cells (i.e., they are autocrine and paracrine mediators), and then are rapidly inactivated.  They are potent in the nanomolar range.  Eicosanoids are not stored within cells, but are synthesized as required.\n【26】 They derive from fatty acids which are incorporated as esters into larger molecules—the phospholipids and  diacylglycerols—found in the cell membrane and nuclear membrane.\n【27】 The first step of eicosanoid biosynthesis occurs when cell is activated by mechanical trauma, cytokines, growth factors or other stimuli.\n【28】 (The stimulus may even be an eicosanoid from a neighboring cell; the pathways are complex.)  This triggers the release of a phospholipase at the cell wall.\n【29】 The phospholipase travels to the nuclear membrane.\n【30】 There, the phospholipase catalyzes ester hydrolysis of phospholipid (by A or diacylglycerol (by phospholipase C).\n【31】 This frees a 20-carbon essential fatty acid.  This hydrolysis appears to be the rate-determining step for eicosanoid formation.\n【32】 The fatty acids may be released by any of several phospholipases.\n【33】 Of these, type IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA is the key actor, as cells lacking cPLA2 are generally devoid of eicosanoid synthesis.  The phospholipase\n【34】 cPLA2 is specific for phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at the SN2 position.\n【35】 Interestingly, cPLA2 may  release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.\n【36】 ## Peroxidation and reactive oxygen species\n【37】 Next, the free fatty acid is oxygenated along any of several pathways; see the Pathways table.  The eicosanoid pathways (via lipoxygenase or COX) add molecular oxygen (O.  Although the fatty acid is symmetric, the resulting eicosanoids are chiral; the oxidation proceeds with high stereospecificity.\n【38】 The oxidation of lipids is hazardous to cells, particularly when close to the nucleus.\n【39】 There are elaborate mechanisms to prevent unwanted oxidation.\n【40】 COX, the lipoxygenases and the phospholipases are tightly controlled—there are at least eight proteins activated to coordinate generation of leukotrienes.\n【41】 Several of these exist in multiple isoforms.\n【42】 Oxidation by either COX or lipoxygenase releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the initial products in eicosanoid generation are themselves highly reactive peroxides.\n【43】 LTA4 can form adducts with tissue DNA.\n【44】 Other reactions of lipoxygenases generate cellular damage; murine models implicate 15-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n【45】 The oxidation in eicosanoid generation is compartmentalized; this limits the peroxides' damage.\n【46】 The enzymes which are biosynthetic for eicosanoids (e.g. glutathione-S-transferases, epoxide hydrolases and carrier proteins) belong to families whose functions are largely involved with cellular detoxification.\n【47】 This suggests that eicosanoid signaling may have evolved from the detoxification of ROS.\n【48】 The cell must realize some benefit from generating lipid hydroperoxides close-by its nucleus.\n【49】 PGs and LTs  may  signal or regulate DNA-transcription there;\n【50】 LTB4 is ligand for PPARα.\n【51】 ( diagram at  PPAR).\n【52】 ## Biosynthesis of prostanoids\n【53】 Cyclooxygenase (COX)  catalyzes the conversion of the free essential fatty acids to prostanoids by a two-step process.\n【54】 First, two molecules of O2 are added as two peroxide linkages, and a 5-member carbon ring is forged near the middle of the fatty acid chain.  This forms the short-lived, unstable intermediate Prostaglandin G (PGG).\n【55】 Next, one of the peroxide linkages sheds a single oxygen, forming PGH.  ( diagrams and more detail of these steps at Cyclooxygenase).\n【56】 All three classes of prostanoids originate from  PGH.\n【57】 All have distinctive rings in the center of the molecule.\n【58】 They differ in their structures.\n【59】 The PGH compounds (parents to all the rest) have a 5-carbon ring, bridged by two oxygens (a peroxide.)  As the example in Structures of Selected Eicosanoids figure  shows,\n【60】 the derived prostaglandins contain a single, unsaturated 5-carbon ring.\n【61】 In prostacyclins, this ring is conjoined to another oxygen-containing ring.\n【62】 In thromboxanes the ring becomes a 6-member ring with one oxygen.  The leukotrienes do not have rings.\n【63】 ( more detail, including the enzymes involved, in diagrams at Prostanoid.)\n【64】 ## Biosynthesis of leukotrienes\n【65】 The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) uses 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) to convert arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which spontaneously reduces to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE).  The enzyme 5-LO acts again on 5-HETE to convert it into leukotriene A4 (LTA, which may be converted into LTB4 by the enzyme leukotriene A4 epoxide hydrolase. Eosinophils, mast cells, and alveolar macrophages use the enzyme leukotriene C4 synthase to conjugate glutathione with LTA4 to make LTC4, which is transported outside the cell, where a glutamic acid moiety is removed from it to make LTD4. The leukotriene LTD4 is then cleaved by dipeptidases to make LTE4.  The leukotrienes\n【66】 LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 all contain cysteine and are collectively known as the cysteinyl leukotrienes.\n【67】 # Function and pharmacology\n【68】 Eicosanoids have a short half-life, ranging from seconds to minutes.  Dietary antioxidants inhibit the generation of some inflammatory eicosanoids, e.g. trans-resveratrol against thromboxane and some leukotrienes.\n【69】 Most eicosanoid receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily; see the Receptors table or the article eicosanoid receptors.\n【70】 ## The ω-3 and ω-6 series\n【71】 Arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 ω-  sits at the head of the 'arachidonic acid cascade'—more than twenty different eicosanoid-mediated signaling paths controlling a wide array of cellular functions, especially those regulating inflammation, immunity and the central nervous system.\n【72】 In the inflammatory response, two other groups of dietary essential fatty acids form cascades that parallel and compete with the arachidonic acid cascade.  EPA (20:5 ω- provides the most important competing cascade. DGLA (20:3 ω- provides a third, less prominent cascade.  These two parallel cascades soften the inflammatory effects of AA and its products.  Low dietary intake of these less-inflammatory essential fatty acids, especially the ω-3s, has been linked to several inflammation-related diseases, and perhaps some mental illnesses.\n【73】 The U.S. National Institutes of Health and the National Library of Medicine state that there is 'A' level evidence ('strong scientific evidence') that increased dietary ω-3 improves outcomes in hypertriglyceridemia, secondary cardiovascular disease prevention and hypertension.\n【74】 There is 'B' level evidence ('good scientific evidence') for increased dietary ω-3 in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis and protection from ciclosporin toxicity in organ transplant patients.\n【75】 They   note more preliminary evidence showing that dietary ω-3 can ease symptoms in several psychiatric disorders.\n【76】 Besides the influence on eicosanoids, dietary polyunsaturated fats modulate immune response through three other molecular mechanisms.  They\n【77】 (a) alter membrane composition and function, including the composition of lipid rafts;\n【78】 (b) change cytokine biosynthesis and (c) directly activate gene transcription.  Of these, the action on eicosanoids is the best explored.\n【79】 ## Mechanisms of ω-3 action\n【80】 The eicosanoids from AA generally promote inflammation.  Those from EPA and  from GLA (via DGLA) are generally less inflammatory, or inactive, or even anti-inflammatory.\n【81】 The figure shows the ω-3 and -6 synthesis chains, along with the major eicosanoids from AA, EPA and DGLA.\n【82】 Dietary  ω-3 and GLA counter the inflammatory effects of AA's eicosanoids in three ways along the eicosanoid pathways.\n【83】 - Displacement—Dietary ω-3 decreases tissue concentrations of AA.  Animal studies show that increased  dietary ω-3  results in decreased AA in brain  and other tissue. Linolenic acid (18:3 ω- contributes to this by displacing linoleic acid (18:2 ω- from the elongase and desaturase enzymes that produce AA.  EPA inhibits phospholipase A2's release of AA from cell membrane.  Other mechanisms involving the transport of EFAs may  play a role.  The reverse is  true – high dietary linoleic acid decreases the body's conversion of α-linolenic acid to EPA.  However, the effect is not as strong; the desaturase has a higher affinity for α-linolenic acid than it has for linoleic acid.\n【84】 - Competitive inhibition—DGLA and EPA compete with AA for access to the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes.  So the presence of DGLA and EPA in tissues lowers the output of AA's eicosanoids.  For example, dietary GLA increases tissue DGLA and lowers TXB2.  Likewise, EPA inhibits the production of series-2 PG and TX.  Although DGLA forms no LTs, a DGLA derivative blocks  the transformation of AA to LTs.  EPA lowers the formation of the AA-derived cysteinyl leukotrienes (series-4 LTC, LTD, LTE) forming the much less active series-5 instead.  Another ω-3 fat, DHA (22:5 ω-, does not form eicosanoids but inhibits the formation of AA-derived prostanoids.\n【85】 - Counteraction—Some DGLA and EPA derived eicosanoids counteract their AA derived counterparts.  For example, DGLA yields PGE1, which powerfully counteracts PGE2.  It  yields the leukotriene LTB5 which impedes the action of the AA-derived LTB4.\n【86】 ## Complexity of pathways\n【87】 Eicosanoid signaling paths are complex.\n【88】 It is therefore difficult to characterize the action of any particular eicosanoid.\n【89】 For example, PGE2 binds four receptors, dubbed EP1–4.\n【90】 Each is coded by a separate gene, and some exist in multiple isoforms.\n【91】 Each EP receptor in turn couples to a G protein.\n【92】 The EP2, EP4 and one isoform of the EP3 receptors couple to Gs.\n【93】 This increases intracellular cAMP and is anti-inflammatory.\n【94】 EP1 and other EP3 isoforms couple to Gq.\n【95】 This leads to increased intracellular calcium and is pro-inflammatory.\n【96】 Finally, yet another EP3 isoform couples to Gi, which both decreases cAMP and increases calcium. Many immune-system cells express multiple receptors that couple these apparently opposing pathways.\n【97】 Presumably, EPA-derived PGE3 has a somewhat different effect of on this system, but it is not well-characterized.\n【98】 ## Role in inflammation\n【99】 Since antiquity, the cardinal signs of inflammation have been known as: calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling) and rubor (redness).  The eicosanoids are involved with each of these signs.\n【100】 Redness—An insect's sting will trigger the classic inflammatory response.  Short acting vasoconstrictors—PGI2 and TXA2—are released quickly after the injury.  The site may momentarily turn pale.  Then TXA2 mediates the release of the vasodilators PGE2 and LTB4.  The blood vessels engorge and the injury reddens.\n【101】 Swelling—LTB4 makes the blood vessels more permeable. Plasma leaks out  into the connective tissues, and they swell.  The process  looses pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n【102】 Pain—The cytokines increase COX-2 activity.  This  elevates levels of PGE2, sensitizing pain neurons.\n【103】 Heat—PGE2 is a  potent pyretic agent.  Aspirin and NSAIDS—drugs that block the COX pathways and stop prostanoid synthesis—limit fever or the heat of localized inflammation.\n【104】 ## Action of prostanoids\n【105】 Prostanoids mediate local symptoms of inflammation: vasoconstriction or vasodilation, coagulation, pain and fever. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase, specifically the inducible COX-2 isoform, is the hallmark of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin. COX-2 is responsible for pain and inflammation, while COX-1 is responsible for platelet clotting actions.\n【106】 Prostanoids  play pivotal functions  inflammation, platelet aggregation, and vasoconstriction/relaxation. Prostanoids activate the PPARγ members of the steroid/thyroid family of nuclear hormone receptors,  directly influencing gene transcription.\n【107】 ## Action of leukotrienes\n【108】 Leukotrienes play an important  role in inflammation.  There is a neuroendocrine role for LTC4 in luteinizing hormone secretion.  LTB4 causes adhesion and chemotaxis of leukocytes and stimulates aggregation, enzyme release, and generation of superoxide in neutrophils.  Blocking leukotriene receptors can play a role in the management of inflammatory diseases such as asthma (by the drugs montelukast and zafirlukast), psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n【109】 The slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis comprises the cysteinyl leukotrienes.  These  have a clear role in pathophysiological conditions such as asthma,  allergic rhinitis and other nasal allergies, and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases.\n【110】 They  are potent bronchoconstrictors, increase vascular permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulate mucus secretion.  They are released from the lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens and  play a pathophysiological role in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\n【111】 Along with PGD, they function in effector cell trafficking, antigen presentation, immune cell activation, matrix deposition, and fibrosis.\n【112】 # History\n【113】 In 1930, gynecologist Raphael Kurzrok and pharmacologist Charles Leib characterized prostaglandin as a component of semen.\n【114】 Between 1929 and 1932, Burr and Burr showed that restricting fat from animal's diets led to a deficiency disease, and first described the essential fatty acids.\n【115】 In 1935, von Euler identified prostaglandin.\n【116】 In 1964, Bergström and Samuelsson linked these observations when they showed that the \"classical\" eicosanoids were derived from  arachidonic acid, which had earlier been considered to be one of the essential fatty acids.\n【117】 In 1971, Vane showed that aspirin and similar drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.  Von Euler received the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1970, which\n【118】 Samuelsson, Vane, and Bergström  received in 1982.\n【119】 E. J. Corey received it in chemistry in 1990 largely for his synthesis of prostaglandins.\n", "seq_id": 28409, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#51#51#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-19 22:26:44"}

A broken interparticle chemical bond and associated strain-releasing local adjustment in centers of vibration form a configuron, an elementary configurational excitation in an amorphous material. Configurons help to understand the transition from a solid to a fluid with viscous flow.\n【3】 # Introduction\n【4】 An amorphous substance is any in which there is no long-range order over the positions of its constituent particles; i.e., no translational periodicity. Some of the internal kinetic energy of these substances can be in the form of interparticle bonds. The particles making up an amorphous substance can range in size from an electron to stars in a galaxy or galaxies in a galactic cluster. Water is an amorphous substance that  can be crystalline. Amorphous substances undergo transitions from solid to liquid, solid to gas, or liquid to gas, or gas to plasma, for example.\n【5】 The chemical bonding within many amorphous substances can produce short-range order while there is long-range disorder. The short-range order is often a symmetrical arrangement of polyhedra. The long-range disorder can be approached with the disordered arrangement of space-filling polyhedra. These polyhedra are bonded together in a solid and undergo bond breaking through the transitions from solid to fluid. A model based on the configuron or configurational microstate is an approach to understanding the viscosity changes that occur with changes in temperature.\n【6】 # Amorphous substances\n【7】 The particles in an amorphous substance can be subatoms, atoms, ions, molecules, dust, crystallites, or grains, stones, boulders, or larger debris. From the point of view of bonding by gravity the universe is an amorphous substance.\n【8】 Amorphous substances can fall into the usual categories of solid, liquid, gas, or plasma. But some substances which are amorphous, such as sand, are fluids.\n【9】 Water as a liquid has much of the available kinetic energy expressed through additional degrees of freedom than water vapor. Some of this energy is in the form of intermolecular bonds. These bonds are a resistance to flow. Water has a resistance to flow that is considered relatively \"thin\", having a lower viscosity (µL) than other liquids such as vegetable oil. At 25°C, water has a nominal viscosity of 1.0 × 10-3 Pa∙s and motor oil has a nominal apparent viscosity of 250 ×  10-3 Pa∙s.\n【10】 Viscous flow, which results from viscosity, in amorphous materials such as water is a thermally activated process as is viscosity:\n【11】 where QL is the activation energy in the liquid state, T is temperature (K), R is the molar gas constant and AL is approximately a constant.\n【12】 With\n【13】 where Hm is the enthalpy of motion of the broken hydrogen bonds.\n【14】 # Solid-liquid transition in amorphous substances\n【15】 In principle, given a sufficiently high cooling rate, any liquid can be made into an amorphous solid. Cooling reduces molecular mobility. If the cooling rate is faster than the rate at which molecules can organize into a more thermodynamically favorable crystalline state, then an amorphous solid will be formed. Because of entropy considerations, many polymers can be made into amorphous solids by cooling even at slow rates. In contrast, if molecules have sufficient time to organize into a structure with two- or three-dimensional order, then a crystalline (or semi-crystalline) solid is formed. Water is one example. Because of its small molecular size and ability to quickly rearrange, it cannot be made amorphous without resorting to specialized hyperquenching techniques. These produce amorphous ice, which has a quenching rate in the range of metallic glasses.\n【16】 The higher the temperature of an amorphous material the higher the configuron concentration. The higher the configuron concentration the lower the viscosity. As configurons form percolating clusters, an amorphous solid can transition to a liquid. This clustering facilitates viscous flow. Thermodynamic parameters of configurons can be found from viscosity-temperature relationships.\n【17】 # Short-range order\n【18】 Like a liquid an amorphous solid has a topologically disordered distribution of particles but elastic properties of an isotropic solid. The symmetry similarity of both liquid and solid phases cannot explain the qualitative differences in their behavior.\n【19】 Due to chemical bonding characteristics amorphous solids such as glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra. The amorphous structure of glassy silica has no long range order but shows local ordering with respect to the tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen atoms around silicon atoms.\n【20】 # Bond structure\n【21】 One useful approach is to consider the bond system instead of considering the set of particles that form the substance. For each state of matter we can define the set of bonds by a bond lattice model. The congruent bond lattice for amorphous materials is a disordered structure. Moreover the bond lattices of amorphous solids and liquids may have different symmetries in contrast to the symmetry similarity of particles in a liquid or fluid and solid phases.\n【22】 For an amorphous material a given unit can be delimited by its nearest neighbors so that its structure may be characterized by a distribution of Voronoi polyhedra filling the space of the disordered material. Molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that the difference between a liquid and glass of an amorphous material results from the formation of percolation clusters of broken bonds in the Voronoi network.\n【23】 # Hausdorff dimension\n【24】 The Hausdorff dimension (d) generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space. In particular, the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, a line is one, a plane is two, a solid is three, etc. The Hausdorff dimension can be thought of as the power of radii for a set of space filling balls formally expressed by\n【25】 where C is the space (S)-filling Content of a countable number (the index number - i) of balls whose radii (ri) are dimensioned (volumed) to produce the space-filling balls.\n【26】 In three dimensions, the balls can be spheres of many different radii and the volume of each ball is proportional to its r3. Hence the Hausdorff dimension, d = 3. In four dimensions, the balls can be hyperspheres of many different radii and the volume of each ball is proportional to its r4. Consider a sphere that changes its radius with time. At each time the sphere has a finite radius rti that differs from each t-1(i- before and after t+1(i+. The volume calculated is proportional to rspace-filling4 that equals the space occupied for all time.\n【27】 Fractals often are spaces whose Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension. A 2-dimensional fractal has a Hausdorff dimension, d as 2<d<3.\n【28】 There is a symmetry change expressed by step-wise variation in the Hausdorff dimension (d) for bonds at the solid-liquid transition. In the solid state d=3 but for the liquid state d=df (the fractal d) = 2.55 ± 0.05. df occurs at each broken bond.\n【29】 # Glass transition temperature of water\n【30】 The glass transition temperature for water is about 136 K or -137°C. Factors in the formation of amorphous ice include ingredients that form a heterogenous mixture with water (such as is used in the production of ice cream), pressure (which may convert one form into another), and cryoprotectants that lower its freezing point and increase viscosity. Melting low-density amorphous ice (LDA) between 140 and 210 K through its transition temperature shows that it is more viscous than normal water. LDA has a density of 0.94 g/cm³, less dense than the densest water (1.00 g/cm³ at 277 K), but denser than ordinary ice.\n【31】 Amorphous ice is used in some scientific experiments, especially in electron cryomicroscopy of biomolecules. The individual molecules can be preserved for imaging in a state close to what they are in liquid water.\n【32】 Hydrated proteins may  be classed among glass-forming systems, but they show great departures from thermorheological simplicity.\n【33】 # Enthalpy of motion for water configurons\n【34】 A simple estimate of QL can be obtained by using the two temperatures 0°C and 100°C, where µ=1.79 x 10-3 Pa·s at 0°C and 0.28 x 10-3 Pa·s at 100°C, and solving for AL and QL. AL = 7.7 x 10-7 Pa·s and QL = 18 kJmol-1. R=8.314472 JK-1mol-1. Temperature is in K (273.15 + °C). QL includes the energy to break the hydrogen bond and move the configuron, as such HM ≤ QL. Using\n【35】 AL and QL to calculate the viscosity of water and comparing the calculated values to the experimentally determined ones for a range of temperature values shows that there is a systematic deviation at the higher temperatures. As the data for the viscosity of water vapor is available, AV and QV can be estimated: AV ~ 1.2 x 10-4 Pa·s and QV ~ - 6.0 kJmol-1. This added to the calculated configuron contribution\n【36】 improves the fit to the liquid water viscosity data remarkably well, suggesting that like other gas molecules mixed into water, water vapor can  be.\n【37】 # Acknowledgements\n【38】 The content on this page was first contributed by: Henry A.

The changes introduced are relatively minor, and inclu\n【1】 Vasectomy is a safe and effective method of birth control. Although it is a simple elective procedure, vasectomy is associated with potential minor and major complications. The early failure rate of vasectomy (presence of motile sperm in the ejaculate at 3-6 months post-vasectomy) is in the range of 0.2-5% and the late failure rate is in the range of 0.04-0.08%. The no-scalpel vasectomy technique is associated with a lower risk of early postoperative complications and the use of cautery or fascial interposition will reduce the risk of contraceptive failure. As such, detailed preoperative counselling and careful assessment of the post-vasectomy ejaculate (for presence of sperm) is imperative. Failure to provide and document adequate information and counselling to patients may lead to litigation.\n【2】 The focus of this guideline is the management of men presenting for vasectomy. Specifically, the topics covered include preoperative counselling, vasectomy efficacy and complications, technical aspects of vasectomy, post-vasectomy semen testing, and interpretation-communication of post-vasectomy semen results. By performing an extensive literature review, we have generated an evidence-based consensus on the management of these men and have provided a recommendation grade based on the level of evidence . The objective of this guideline is to help standardize the treatment of men presenting for vasectomy.\n【3】 # Preoperative counselling\n【4】 The procedure should be described during the initial consultation. Men must be informed about wound care and the potential for early complications: infection (0.2-1.5%), bleeding or hematoma (4-20%), and primary (early) surgical failure (0.2-5%) with motile sperm in the ejaculate at 3-6 months post-vasectomy.  Men should  be made aware of late complications: chronic scrotal pain (1-14%) and delayed vasectomy failure after azoospermia at four months (0.05-1%). 1,5,6 Complications, such as bleeding and testicular pain, can often be managed medically but infrequently (<0.1%) these conditions may require a surgical intervention. 7,8 Exceptionally, surgical management of these complications may lead to testicular atrophy or an orchiectomy. Such information should be discussed verbally, and an information pamphlet should  be provided. The patient must be told that the vasectomy should be viewed as a permanent form of contraception with a high probability of reversibility. 9 Preoperative sperm banking and postoperative vasectomy reversal and sperm retrieval (for subsequent in vitro fertilization) can be discussed if patients are concerned about the permanent nature of the procedure.\n【5】 Patients can be reassured that the data do not demonstrate a clear association between vasectomy and prostate cancer. 10 No other late complications have been associated with vasectomy (e.g., vascular disease, hypertension, testicular cancer) and, as such, these need not be discussed unless the patient inquires.\n【6】 Most men are potentially fertile shortly after vasectomy. Moreover, in cases of early re-canalization or technical failure (e.g., missed vas deferens), men will remain fertile. Therefore, couples must be reminded about the rate of primary (early) surgical failure (0.2-5%) and instructed to use  4 A re-do vasectomy is recommended if motile spermatozoa continue to be present in the ejaculate six months after the procedure. Although the relationship between this finding (motile spermatozoa in the ejaculate at six months postoperatively) and subsequent pregnancy has not been established, pregnancies have been attributed to unprotected intercourse during the immediate post-vasectomy period. 11 While it is good practice to allow patients time for further reflection on their decision to undergo vasectomy, reconsider alternative contraceptive methods, and seek additional opinions from other healthcare providers, some patients may be fully ready to undergo vasectomy at the end of the initial consultation. In fact, it is logical to assume that many men in Canada seeking vasectomy have obtained information on the procedure from various sources, including the media, internet, friends/family, and/or other healthcare providers. Currently, there is no good data in the literature suggesting that providing a \"cool-down\" period after initial encounter of vasectomy counselling correlates to better surgical outcomes or better patient satisfaction. Thus, in the absence of valid medical reasons, such as time required to discontinue certain medications (e.g., anticoagulation) or recovery from temporary change of health status (e.g., acute infection), vasectomy may be performed (in most patients) shortly after the initial consultation.\n【7】 With regards to the age limit of vasectomy, any man with the legal capacity to provide informed consent (this may vary from province to province) may undergo vasectomy. Studies in the U.S. indicate that it is rare for men below the age of 25 to choose vasectomy as a form of contraception. 12,13 An earlier study indicates that men who undergo vasectomy in their 20s have a 12.5 times greater likelihood of subsequently seeking vasectomy reversal. 14 Although data are lacking for men in their 20s seeking vasectomy, it is prudent to offer more time to these men (to reflect on their decision) prior to performing the surgery. Furthermore, when counselling about vasectomy in young patients, particularly minors and patients with an unclear level of understanding of or motivation to undergo vasectomy, surgeons should be prepared to offer consultations for psychosocial and ethical assessment prior to performing the surgery. Special consideration should be given when performing vasectomy in men with a clinical varicocele or with prior varicocelectomy. It has been estimated that varicoceles are found in 15% of the general male population, with a higher prevalence in men with primary or secondary infertility. Men who undergo surgical varicocelectomy for repair of a clinical varicocele may be left with only the deferential veins as the sole testicular venous return. In addition, during varicocelectomy, it is  possible to damage the testicular artery(ies), leaving the deferential artery as the principal arterial supply to the testis. Thus, when a vasectomy is performed in men who have undergone or may undergo varicocelectomy in the future, it is strongly advisable to isolate the vas deferens carefully and completely exclude the associated deferential arteries and veins to avoid potential injury to the deferential vasculature and minimize the risk of ipsilateral testicular injury. 15\n【8】 # Vasectomy technique (access and occlusion)\n【9】 The technique of vasectomy has undergone significant modifications over the years. Furthermore, the equipment, materials, and methods of anesthesia have  evolved over the years. Though experienced surgeons may prefer their own approach for vasectomies, it is advisable for surgeons to obtain regular continuing medical education focusing on various issues surrounding vasectomy, from surgical techniques to new studies in the latest peer-reviewed journals and clinical guidelines.\n【10】 Local anesthesia is sufficient for most patients undergoing a vasectomy; however, anxious patients or those with complicating factors, such as a previous orchidopexy or other scrotal surgery, may require sedation or a general anesthetic. There is controversy regarding the benefit of topical anesthetic before injection of local anesthetic; 16,17 however, a small, 27-32-gauge needle is thought to be beneficial. Pneumatic injectors have not shown a clear benefit, 18,19 but may be suitable for patents with a needle phobia. The use of buffered xylocaine has not been studied in vasectomy patients.\n【11】 # Isolation of the vas deferens\n【12】 # Conventional vs. no scalpel vasectomy\n【13】 The two most common surgical techniques for accessing the vas during vasectomy are the traditional incisional method and the no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV) technique. The conventional incisional technique involves the use of a scalpel to make one or two incisions in the scrotal skin to access the vas deferens; the NSV technique uses a sharp, forceps-like instrument to puncture the skin to access the vas deferens.\n【14】 A Cochrane review of two randomized controlled trials found that compared to the standard incision technique, the NSV approach is associated with a significantly lower risk of postoperative hematoma (odds ratio  0.20, 95%   The Cochrane review  found that NSV is a faster procedure than the standard incision technique; however, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness (azoospermic or absence of motile sperm) between the two procedures (1.6% vs. 1.8% early failure rate for the NSV and the conventional scalpel techniques, respectively). 20\n【15】 Recommendation: NSV should be performed because it is associated with a significantly lower risk of postoperative complications (hematoma, pain, infection) than conventional vasectomy (Grade A-B).\n【16】 # Vas occlusion technique\n【17】 # Fascial interposition vs. no fascial interposition\n【18】 In a randomized controlled trial of over 800 vasectomies, it was shown that the use of fascial interposition during vasectomy is associated with a significantly higher rate of azoospermia at three months than simple ligation and excision without fascial interposition ( 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.;  however, fascial interposition may increase the complication rate of vasectomy. 25\n【19】 # Mucosal cautery\n【20】 In a comparative (case-control) study, cautery of the vas was associated with a lower risk of failure (defined as >100 000 sperm in the ejaculate) than fascial interposition (1% vs. 4.9%,  4.8, 95% CI 1.6-14.. 3\n【21】 # Recommendation: Mucosal cautery and/or fascial interposition (with vas ligation and excision\n【22】 ) should be performed during vasectomy, as these techniques are associated with the lowest failure rates (Grade B). Nonetheless, surgeons may opt to use their preferred occlusion technique as long they obtain consistently low vasectomy failure rates.\n【23】 # Postoperative counselling\n【24】 After the vasectomy has been performed, men should be instructed about proper wound and scrotal care and shortterm physical limitations. Men should be told how to collect the semen sample (completeness, type of container) and reminded of the importance of submitting the sample to the laboratory in a timely fashion (within 30-60 minutes after producing the sample). They should  be told that semen samples should be collected after an abstinence period of two or more days and no more than seven days, and maintained at body temperature before delivery to the laboratory. A list of local laboratories that perform proper postvasectomy semen analysis should be given to the patient. The men must be reminded to use other contraceptive measures until post-vasectomy semen testing has confirmed absence of motile sperm.\n【25】 # Contraceptive efficacy of vasectomy\n【26】 The early failure rate of vasectomy (presence of motile sperm in the ejaculate at 3-6 months post-vasectomy) is in the range of 0.2-5% and has been linked to surgeon experience and the technique. 25 Both technical failure (e.g., missed vas deferens) and early re-canalization of the vas deferens have been proposed as plausible explanations for early vasectomy failure.\n【27】 Late vasectomy failure has been reported to be in the range of 0.04-0.08% (approximately 1/2000 cases) and is defined as the presence of motile spermatozoa in the ejaculate after documented azoospermia in two post-vasectomy semen analyses. 26,27 In most cases, late failure is first identified as a pregnancy and later confirmed by semen analysis (documenting presence of motile spermatozoa).\n【28】 The reappearance of sperm (often immotile) after documented azoospermia three months post-vasectomy may be much higher than 1/2000 according to the reported identification of spermatozoa in nearly 10% of ejaculates from men undergoing semen assessment prior to vasectomy reversal. 28 It is unlikely that the reappearance (or persistence) of immotile sperm years after vasectomy is of clinical significance, as this has not been associated with documented pregnancies. 29,30\n【29】 # Post-vasectomy semen testing\n【30】 The post-vasectomy semen analysis should be performed on fresh (unprocessed) semen and on the centrifuged semen to confirm the absence of low numbers of motile sperm. The laboratory should give an estimation of sperm concentration or numbers of spermatozoa observed per high power field (×400 magnification).  It is important to recognize that compliance with post-vasectomy semen testing is a significant issue, with up to 30% of men failing to submit a single sample. 32,33  depicts a proposed algorithm for post-vasectomy testing protocol.\n【31】 # One vs. two post-vasectomy samples\n【32】 Surveys have shown significant variability in the post-vasectomy testing protocols. 34 Most agree that a single semen analysis showing azoospermia is sufficient to deem the vasectomy effective. 31,35 Moreover, a single semen analysis showing rare non-motile sperm (<100 000 non-motile sperm/ml) is  sufficient to deem the vasectomy effective, assuming the analysis is performed by an experienced, reputable lab.\n【33】 In a study of 5233 vasectomies, Alderman reported that the risk of conversion from azoospermia or rare non-motile sperm to greater numbers of sperm is very rare (approximately 0.1% of cases) and is more commonly followed by conversion to azoospermia. 36 Similarly, Barone et al estimated that the predictive value of a single semen analysis with rare non-motile sperm for vasectomy success is 99.7%. 37 A second semen analysis should be requested in men with greater numbers of non-motile sperm (>100 000 non-motile sperm/ml) and/ or any number of motile sperm on the first semen analysis. Some clinicians may prefer to request two semen samples at the onset, as this may reduce the number of post-vasectomy counselling sessions (e.g., phone calls or office visits); however, this may  decrease the overall compliance. 33 Recommendation: A single semen sample showing azoospermia or rare non-motile sperm (100 000/ml) or any number of motile sperm on the first semen analysis (Grade C).\n【34】 # Timing of post-vasectomy testing\n【35】 Although most studies suggest that post-vasectomy testing be conducted at three months after vasectomy, the issue remains debatable, with some studies suggesting earlier examinations and others proposing later examinations. 33,38,39 The difficulty in establishing a set time point for semen testing stems largely from the variable success of the vasectomy occlusion techniques. 25 Azoospermia is achieved much later with the ligation (and excision) compared to the cautery or fascial interposition techniques. 25,38,40 The argument in favor of waiting at least three months is that this will reduce the number of false-positive samples and minimize the need for repeat laboratory assessment and counselling. 39 Recommendation: Post-vasectomy testing should be conducted at three months after vasectomy (Grade C). CUA BPR: Vasectomy\n【36】 # Interpreting and communicating results\n【37】 Azoospermia or rare immotile sperm (<100 000 per/ml) as an indication of successful vasectomy Contraceptive measures may be abandoned after men have produced one azoospermic sample or one semen sample with rare (<100 000/ml) immotile spermatozoa. It is the physician's responsibility (not the laboratory's) to communicate these results to the patient and measures should be taken to ensure that patients are not lost to followup. Physicians must  remind couples about the risk of late failure (approximately 1/ despite azoospermia or rare immotile sperm on initial testing.\n【38】 It is estimated that approximately 20-40% of samples have rare non-motile sperm at three months post-vasectomy, with a lower percentage having non-motile sperm at six months .32,39 When there is doubt regarding the analysis, physicians may want to contact the laboratory and confirm that there was no reporting error (i.e., that the sample was incorrectly labeled as \"non-motile\"). The literature has suggested that the risk of pregnancy occurring from these nonmotile sperm is small -perhaps no more than the risk of late pregnancy after two azoospermic semen samples because of spontaneous re-canalization. 29,30 Similarly, rare non-motile sperm can appear in the ejaculate one or more years after vasectomy with no increased risk of failure (pregnancy or motile sperm). Therefore, repeat semen testing in men with rare non-motile sperm is unnecessary because pregnancy is very unlikely to occur in this setting.\n【39】 Motile sperm or large numbers of immotile sperm as a measure of failure If any motile sperm or substantial numbers of immotile spermatozoa (>100 000 sperm/ml) are detected, the physician must inform the patient to continue the use of other contraceptive measures and request that a repeat semen analysis be performed. A repeat vasectomy is indicated when there is persistence of motile sperm or large numbers of nonmotile sperm in the ejaculate. No long-term studies have evaluated the risk of pregnancy in this setting.\n【40】 Recommendation: Persistence of any number of motile sperm or >100 000 sperm/ml on two semen samples is an indication of vasectomy failure (Grade C).\n【41】 # Summary\n【42】 Vasectomy is a safe and effective method of birth control. The NSV technique is associated with a lower risk of early postoperative complications and the use of mucosal cautery or fascial interposition will reduce the risk of contraceptive failure. Post-vasectomy testing should consist of analysis of one or two semen samples at approximately three months after vasectomy. The laboratory should examine a freshly produced seminal fluid specimen by direct microscopy and if no sperm are seen, the centrifuged sample should be examined for the presence of motile and non-motile spermatozoa. Other contraceptive measures may be abandoned after the production of one azoospermic ejaculate or one ejaculate with <100 000 immotile spermatozoa. Couples must be counselled (both pre-and postoperatively) about the risks of early and late failure.\n【43】 Competing interests: Dr. Zini holds investments in YAD Tech.

Common adverse reactions include flushing, nausea, fever, and shivering.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 - Dosing Information\n【8】 - Each vial of Profilnine is labeled with total units expressed as international units (IU) according to the WHO International Standard. One unit approximates the activity in one mL of normal plasma.\n【9】 - A 1% increase in factor IX (0.01 units)/units administered/kg can be expected. The amount of Profilnine required to establish hemostasis will vary with each patient and depends on the circumstances. The following formula may be used as a guide in determining the number of units to be administered:\n【10】 - In normal clinical practice there is variability among patients and their clinical condition. Therefore, the factor IX level of each patient should be monitored frequently during replacement therapy.\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【13】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Factor IX complex in adult patients.\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【15】 - Dosing Information\n【16】 - 20 mL of factor IX complex containing 2000 units of factors II, IX, and X\n【17】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【18】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【19】 - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. However, across a well controlled half-life and recovery clinical trial in patients previously treated with factor IX concentrates for Hemophilia B, the two pediatric patients receiving Profilnine responded similarly when compared with the adult patients.\n【20】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【21】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Factor IX complex in pediatric patients.\n【23】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【24】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Factor IX complex in pediatric patients.\n【25】 # Contraindications\n【26】 - None known.\n【27】 # Warnings\n【28】 - Because Profilnine is made from pooled human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. Stringent procedures designed to reduce the risk of adventitious agent transmission have been employed in the manufacture of this product, from the screening of plasma donors and the collection and testing of plasma to the application of viral elimination/reduction steps such as DEAE chromatography, solvent detergent treatment and nanofiltration in the manufacturing process. Despite these measures, such products can potentially transmit disease: therefore the risk of infectious agents cannot be totally eliminated. The physician must weigh the risks and benefits of using this product and discuss these issues with the patient. Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) for patients in receipt of plasma derived factor IX complex concentrates is recommended.\n【29】 - The use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications and the use of such products may be potentially hazardous in patients undergoing surgery, in patients post surgery, in patients with known liver disease, and in patients with signs of fibrinolysis, thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). For these patients, clinical surveillance for early signs of consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product. Profilnine should only be administered to patients when the beneficial effects of use outweigh the serious risk of potential hypercoagulation.\n【30】 ### Precautions\n【31】 - Exercise caution when handling Profilnine due to the limited risk of exposure to viral infection.\n【32】 - Discard any unused Profilnine vial contents. Discard administration equipment after single use. Do not resterilize components. Do not reuse components.\n【33】 # Adverse Reactions\n【34】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【35】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【36】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【37】 - As with other intravenous administration of other plasma-derived products, the following reactions may be observed following administration: headache, fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, tingling, lethargy, hives, or manifestation of allergic reactions.\n【38】 - In addition, during post-approval use of Profilnine, cases of allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria, shortness of breath, hypotension, and pruritus) and adverse reactions characterized by either thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been reported. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n【39】 # Drug Interactions\n【40】 There is limited information regarding Drug Interactions of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【41】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【42】 ### Pregnancy\n【43】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【44】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【45】 - Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Profilnine. It is  not known whether Profilnine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Profilnine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly indicated.\n【46】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【47】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【48】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Factor IX complex in women who are pregnant.\n【49】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【50】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Factor IX complex during labor and delivery.\n【51】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【52】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex with respect to nursing mothers.\n【53】 ### Pediatric Use\n【54】 - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. However, across a well controlled half-life and recovery clinical trial in patients previously treated with factor IX concentrates for Hemophilia B, the two pediatric patients receiving Profilnine responded similarly when compared with the adult patients.\n【55】 ### Geriatic Use\n【56】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex with respect to geriatric patients.\n【57】 ### Gender\n【58】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex with respect to specific gender populations.\n【59】 ### Race\n【60】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex with respect to specific racial populations.\n【61】 ### Renal Impairment\n【62】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex in patients with renal impairment.\n【63】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【64】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【65】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【66】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Factor IX complex in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【67】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【68】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Factor IX complex in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【69】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【70】 ### Administration\n【71】 - Intravenous\n【72】 ### Monitoring\n【73】 - After repeated treatment with Profilnine, patients should be monitored for the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing.\n【74】 # IV Compatibility\n【75】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【76】 # Overdosage\n【77】 ## Acute Overdose\n【78】 There is limited information regarding Acute Overdose of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【79】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【80】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【81】 # Pharmacology\n【82】 There is limited information regarding Factor IX complex Pharmacology in the drug label.\n【83】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【84】 - Profilnine is a mixture of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, II, X and low levels of VII. The administration of Profilnine temporarily increases the plasma levels of factor IX, thus enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency.\n【85】 ## Structure\n【86】 - Factor IX Complex, Profilnine, is a solvent detergent treated, nanofiltered, sterile, lyophilized concentrate of coagulation factors IX, II, and X and low levels of factor VII. The factor II content is not more than (NMT) 150 units- per 100 factor IX units, the factor X content is NMT 100 units per 100 factor IX units, and the factor VII content is NMT 35 units per 100 factor IX units. Profilnine is intended for intravenous administration only. Each vial is a single dose container and is labeled with the factor IX potency expressed in international units. Profilnine does not contain heparin and contains no preservatives. Profilnine contains few, if any, activated factors based on results from the non-activated partial thromboplastin time (NAPTT) test.\n【87】 - Profilnine is prepared from pooled human plasma and purified by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose adsorption. The risk of transmission of infective agents by Profilnine has been substantially reduced by donor selection procedures and virus screening of individual donations and plasma pools by serological and nucleic acid testing. In addition, specific, effective virus elimination steps such as nanofiltration and solvent/detergent (tri-n-butyl phosphate/TNBP) treatment have been incorporated into the Profilnine manufacturing process. Additional removal of some viruses occurs during the DEAE cellulose product purification step.\n【88】 - The ability of the manufacturing process to eliminate virus from Profilnine was evaluated in the laboratory by intentionally adding virus to product just prior to the elimination step and monitoring virus removal.  shows the amounts of virus that can be removed by solvent detergent treatment, nanofiltration and purification by DEAE chromatography when vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), human immunodeficiency virus-1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-, parvo virus, West Nile virus (WNV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) were evaluated in these virus spiking studies. The results indicate that the solvent detergent treatment step effectively inactivates enveloped viruses and the nanofiltration step effectively removes both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.\n【89】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【90】 - A clinical study that evaluated twelve subjects with hemophilia B indicated that, following administration of Profilnine, the factor IX in vivohalf-life was 24.68 ± 8.29 hours and recovery was 1.15 ± 0.16 units/dL per unit infused per kg body weight.\n【91】 - Administration of factor IX complex can result in higher than normal levels of factor II due to its significantly longer half-life.\n【92】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【93】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacokinetics of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【94】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【95】 There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【96】 # Clinical Studies\n【97】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Factor IX complex in the drug label.\n【98】 # How Supplied\n【99】 - Profilnine is supplied in sterile lyophilized form in single dose vials accompanied by a suitable volume of diluent (Sterile Water for Injection, USP), according to factor IX potency. Each vial is labeled with the factor IX potency expressed in International Units which is referenced to the WHO International Standard. Profilnine is packaged with a Mix2Vial filter transfer set for use in administration.\n【100】 - It is available in the following potencies, and the product is  color coded based upon assay on the carton and vial label as follows:\n【101】 - Profilnine is stable for three years, up to the expiration date printed on its label, provided that the storage temperature does not exceed 25 °C (77 °F). Do not freeze.\n【102】 ## Storage\n【103】 There is limited information regarding Factor IX complex Storage in the drug label.\n【104】 # Images\n【105】 ## Drug Images\n【106】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【107】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【108】 - After repeated treatment with Profilnine, patients should be monitored for the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing.\n【109】 - Hypersensitivity and allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported for all factor IX complex concentrate products. Patients must be informed of the early symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reaction, including hives, generalized urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, wheezing, faintness, hypotension, tachycardia and anaphylaxis. Patients must be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician and/or seek immediate emergency care if these symptoms occur.\n【110】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【111】 - Alcohol-Factor IX complex interaction has not been established.

Hand surgeons do not just engage in surgery - they are the primary medical doctors to deal with these issues, and often use non-surgical approaches.\n【3】 In the US, hand surgery is a subspecialty of surgery.  A hand surgeon must first qualify as a general surgeon, plastic surgeon, or orthopedic surgeon, and then must do a one year long fellowship in hand practice.  Board certified general, plastic, or orthopedics surgeons who have completed approved fellowship training in hand surgery and have met a number of other practice requirements are qualified to take the \"Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand\" examination, commonly referred to as the \"CAQSH.\"\n【4】 The historical context for the three qualifying fields is that both plastic surgery and orthopedic surgery are more recent branches off the general surgery main trunk.  Modern hand surgery began in World War II as a military planning decision. US Army Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, knew that hand injuries in World War I had poor outcomes in part because there was no formal system to deal with them. Kirk  knew that his civilian general surgical colleague Dr. Sterling Bunnell had a special interest and experience in hand reconstruction. Kirk tapped Bunnell to train military surgeons in the management of hand injuries to treat the war casualties, and at that time hand surgery became a formal specialty. Orthopedic surgeons continued to develop special techniques to manage small bones, as found in the wrist and hand. Pioneering plastic surgeons developed microsurgical techniques for repairing the small nerves and arteries of the hand. Surgeons from all three specialties have contributed to the development of techniques for repairing tendons and managing a broad range of acute and chronic hand injuries. Hand surgery incorporates techniques from orthopaedics, plastic surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, vascular and microvascular surgery and psychiatry and is a complex, fascinating specialty.\n【5】 Two medical societies exist in the United States to provide continuing medical education to hand surgeons: the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and the American Association for Hand Surgery.\n【6】 \n【7】 \n【8】 \n【9】 hu:Kézsebész\n", "seq_id": 25735, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#5#9#内容与文本无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:36:34"}

Many of them are included below as a sort of glossary to assist with understanding the many articles that include these types of words.\n【3】 # Terms\n【4】 Anterior refers to the direction towards an individuals lips, as opposed to posterior, which refers to the directions towards the back of an individual's head.  The term anterior teeth refers to incisors and canines.\n【5】 Apical refers to the direction towards the root tip(s) of a tooth, as opposed to coronal, which refers to the direction towards the crown.  It may  refer to something relating to the roots, such as apical support. his term is nearly synonymous with both cervical and gingival.\n【6】 Axial refers to a plane parallel to the surface of a tooth. For example, if a drill bur would be inserted into a tooth from any side (proximal, facial or lingual, the depth of the hole is defined by the axial wall of the hole.\n【7】 Buccal refers to the side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek, as opposed to lingual or palatal, which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the tongue or palate, respectively. Although technically referring only to posterior teeth (where the cheeks are present instead of lips, use of this term may extend to all teeth, anterior and posterior), this term may be employed to describe the facial surface of (or directions in relation to) anterior teeth as well.\n【8】 Cervical, which simply means neck in Latin (as in cervical vertebrae), refers to the narrowing of the contours of the tooth surface at or near the CEJ, where the crown meets the root. When referring to direction in relation to entities on or of the crown, it is nearly synonymous with both apical and gingival.\n【9】 Coronal refers to the direction towards the crown of a tooth, as opposed to apical, which refers to the direction towards the tip(s) of the root(s). It may  refer to something relating to the crown, such as coronal forces.\n【10】 Distal refers to the direction towards the last tooth in each quadrant of a dental arch, as opposed to mesial, which refers to the direction towards the anterior midline. Each tooth can be described as having a distal surface and, for posterior teeth, a distobuccal (DB) and a distolingual (DL) corner or cusp.\n【11】 Facial refers to the side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek or lips, as opposed to lingual or palatal, which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the tongue or palate, respectively.  This term is an umbrella term for both the term buccal and labial.\n【12】 Gingival refers to the direction towards the gingiva, synonymous with cervical and similar to apical.  However, locations on teeth already more apical to the interface of the crown and root, referred to as the CEJ, tend not to be described using this term, as it would lead to confusion, as the exact definition is ambiguous.  Additionally, this term would not be used when referring to a tooth ex vivo.\n【13】 Incisal refers either to the direction towards the biting edge of anterior teeth or to something relating to this edge, such as the terms incisal guidance or incisal edge. This is the sister term to occlusal, which related to the analogous location on posterior teeth.\n【14】 Inferior, as usual, refers to the direction towards the feet of an human's body, as opposed to superior, which refers to the direction towards the head.  However, use of these terms should enjoy only limited usage when discussing features of a tooth, as, for example, something more inferior on a mandibular tooth will be situated more superior on a maxillary tooth, as they exhibit an inverted relationship.  It is for this reason that the terms coronal an apical are substituted.\n【15】 Labial refers to the side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the lip, as opposed to lingual or palatal, which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the tongue or palate, respectively.  Although technically referring only to anterior teeth (where the lips are present instead of cheeks, use of the term buccal may extend to all teeth, anterior and posterior.)\n【16】 Lingual refers to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the tongue, as opposed to buccal, labial or facial which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek or lips, respectively.  Although this term is technically specific to the mandible, it enjoys extensive use in reference to the maxilla as well.\n【17】 Mandibular refers to entities related to the mandible.\n【18】 Marginal may be used to refer to a number of different 'margins' that are involved in dentistry. The edge of tooth structure that is prepared to meet the edge of a prosthetic crown is called a margin, as is the aforementioned edge of the crown; an example of this usage would be \"a poorly fitting crown might exhibit marginal leakage.\"  The gingiva and bone that abut the teeth are referred to as 'marginal', as in marginal periodontitis.  The bulk of tooth structure on the occlusal surface at the point of contact of posterior teeth is referred to as the marginal ridge.\n【19】 Maxillary refers to entities related to the maxilla.\n【20】 Mesial refers to the direction towards the anterior midline is a dental arch, as opposed to distal, which refers to the direction towards the last tooth in each quadrant. Each tooth can be described as having a mesial surface and, for posterior teeth, a mesiobuccal (MB) and a mesiolingual (MB) corner or cusp.\n【21】 Occlusal refers either to the direction towards the biting surface of posterior teeth or to something relating to this surface, such as the terms occlusal interference or occlusal surface. This is the sister term to incisal, which related to the analogous location on anterior teeth. Restorations are designated by their location on a tooth, and abbreviated as such. Thus, for example, an amalgam restoration on the distal-occlusal of a tooth would be termed a DO amalgam.\n【22】 Palatal refers to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the palate, as opposed to buccal, labial or facial which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek or lips, respectively.  This term is strictly used in the maxilla.\n【23】 Posterior refers to the direction towards the back of an individual's head, as opposed to anterior, which refers to the directions towards an individuals lips.  The term posterior teeth refers to premolars and molars.\n【24】 Proximal is an umbrella term which includes both mesial and distal, such as when referring to the proximal surfaces of teeth.\n【25】 Superior, as usual, refers to the direction towards the head of an human's body, as opposed to inferior, which refers to the direction towards the feet. However, use of these terms should enjoy only limited usage when discussing features of a tooth, as, for example, something more superior on a mandibular tooth will be situated more inferior on a maxillary tooth, as they exhibit an inverted relationship. It is for this reason that the terms coronal and apical are substituted.\n", "seq_id": 3579, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-14 19:20:13", "update_time": "2024-03-19 01:34:04"}

In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure. Return to top\n【9】 ### Post-marketing experience\n【10】 Postmarketing experience includes reports of acute Risperidone overdosage, with estimated doses of up to 360 mg. In general, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Other adverse events reported since market introduction which were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to Risperidone overdose, include torsade de pointes, prolonged QT interval, convulsions, cardiopulmonary arrest, and rare fatality associated with multiple drug overdose. Return to top\n【11】 ## Management of overdosage\n【12】 In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. Because of the rapid disintegration of Risperdal M-TABOrally Disintegrating Tablets, pill fragments may not appear in gastric contents obtained with lavage.\n【13】 The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects that might be additive to those of risperidone. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of risperidone, resulting in problematic hypotension.\n【14】 There is no specific antidote to Risperidone. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of risperidone-induced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
