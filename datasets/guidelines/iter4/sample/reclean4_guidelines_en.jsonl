Employed by hospitals, clinics, and the military; BMETs are highly skilled technicians responsible for ensuring medical equipment is deemed serviceable, safe, and properly cond to meet the mission of a hospital organization.  These men and women are responsible for installing, inspecting, repairing, calibration, preventive maintenance, education, and modification of biomedical equipment and support systems. BMETs advise staff and other agencies on theory of operation, basic physiological principles, and safe clinical application of biomedical equipment maintaining the facility's patient care and medical staff equipment.\n- The acceptance of the Biomedical Equipment Technician in the private sector was given a big push in 1970 when consumer advocate Ralph Nader wrote an article in which he claimed, \"At least 1,200 people a year are electrocuted and many more are killed or injured in needless electrical accidents in hospitals.\n- These technicians perform much work in the biomedical/clinical engineering field that consists of and cover a vast array of different fields and devices.\n- Examples of different areas of biomedical equipment technology are:\n- Radiographic and flouroscopic x-ray,\n- Diagnostic ultrasound,\n- LASERs,\n- Mamography,\n- Telemedicine,\n- Film image processing,\n- Nuclear Medicine,\n- Gamma cameras,\n- Positron emission tomography (PET),\n- Medical imaging,\n- Computed Topography (CT),\n- Electron microscope,\n- Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS),\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging instrument ,\n- Physiological monitoring,\n- Sterilization,\n- Dental,\n- Optometry,\n- Surgical,\n- Anesthesia,\n- Laboratory,\n- Dialysis,\n- Respiratory Services (ventilators)\n- Computers, and Information Technology\n- BMETs work closely with Medical Materiel personnel to obtain parts, supplies, and equipment and even closer with facility management to coordinate equipment installations requiring certain facility requirements/modifications.\n\n【1】 # Regulatory issues\n- Federal and State Regulatory issues are never far from the mind of a biomedical equipment technician. We must satisfy safety regulations, most biomedical systems must have documentation to show that they were managed, modified, tested, delivered, and used according to a planned, approved quality assurance process. This thought is used to increase the quality and safety of diagnostics and therapeutic equipment using risk management practices by reducing the risk that a patient or staff could be harmed by that piece of equipment.\n- In the United States, BMETs may operate under various different regulatory frameworks. Clinical devices and technologies are generally governed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA  particularly chapter 7, NFPA 70, Life Safety Code 101, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21,  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) hospital or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care standards; and ensures compliance with these codes and standards for the US government registry of biomedical devices.\n- Other countries typically have their own mechanisms for regulation.\n\n【2】 # Biomedical equipment technology training\n- Traditionally, biomedical equipment technology has been an interdisciplinary field to specialize in after completing an Associate degree in Biomedical Equipment Technology, Biomedical Electronics Technology or Biomedical Engineering Technology. Some BMETs get their training through the military.\n- Most entry level BMETs enter into the field with a 2-year associates degree in biomedical equipment technology, or they spend around one year in full time military training. A 4-year graduate is an applied engineer that perform the same medical equipment management duties similar to a clinical engineering(known as clinical engineer), BMET Manager, or Director/Executive. Practical experience is gained through internships. Continuing education in the form of service schools is typically provided by specific medical device manufacturers.\n\n【3】 # Professional certification\n- Many BMETs pursue professional certification, such as satisfying certain education requirements and passing an examination to become a certified biomedical equipment technican (CBET).  There are two other certifications BMETs can obtain such as: radiology equipment specialists (CRES), and Certified Laboratory Equipment Specialists (CLES). In many cases, carrying the title of \"CBET\" is highly encouraged, not mandatory, and is respected within the technical community.\n\n【4】 # Employment\n- In-House:\n find employment with a third-party independent service organization (ISO) or original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n- Field Service:\n- BMETs working for an OEM or ISO are many times called Field Service Engineers (FSE). FSE are more narrowly focused and specialized technicians who support Service and Sales.\n- Both must face increased risk of contact with electrical, mechanical, high pressure steam, noise, blood borne diseases, LASERs, chemicals and nuclear contaminates.\n\n【5】 # Military Roles\n- All military members entering the BMET career field receive comprehensive down to the component level and theory technical training at the DoD Biomedical Equipment Technician Training School.  This school has a partnership with Aims Community College where students receive 81 quarter credits (from the Community College of the Air Force) toward an Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) Degree with an emphasis in Biomedical Electronic Technology.  In addition to the credits acquired from DoD BMET Training School, a minimum of 24 credits must be completed through Aims Community College to receive a degree.\n\n【6】 # United States Air Force\n- Job Code 4A2X1 (where X represents the corresponding skill level 3, 5, 7 or \n- Air Force Instruction 41-201, \"Managing Clinical Engineering Programs\" is essentially the Air Force BMET's bible.\n- More at \n- More at \n- Career Field Education & Training Plan (pdf)\n\n【7】 # United States Army\n- Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) 68A.\n- The Army recently redesignated this MOS from 91A to MOS 68A.\n- More at \n- More at \n\n【8】 # United States Navy\n- Navy Enlisted Codes HM-8479, HM-8478 and HM-8732 (Dental Repair Technician)\n- More regarding HM-8479 Basic BMET at \n- More regarding HM-8478 Advanced BMET at \n- History of the HM-8410 NEC\n - HM-8410 was established and HM-8732 NEC was disestabilshed.  Former HM-8732s were DNEC and given the 8479 NEC.  This was done only due to the fact that the HM-8732 was disestabilished.\n- HM-8732 billets were converted to HM-8479 billets.\n, HM-8478 and HM-8479 have converted to one NEC: HM-8410\n- Navy BMETs follow the guidelines stated in the NAVMED P-5132.  The most current instruction is the NAVMEDLOGCOMINST 6700.1\n\n【9】 # Personal Characteristics\n- The best characteristics of an \"excellent\" BMET are someone that can\\.\n- Due to the wide range of equipment and systems managed, extensive communication with those from management and other healthcare disciplines is required. Life threating decisions rapidly solved with team approaches improve medical care delivery and cost effectiveness. Biomeds work nationally to advance process and improve equipment and devices. Biomeds are called for almost any  new emergency as in house experts on a broad range of challenges. Biomeds monitor safety throughout the healthcare facilities and document trends. BMETs respond at all hours often coordinating service if unable to perform a direct repair.

The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with CUBICIN.\n\n【3】 # Pharmacokinetics\n- CUBICIN Administered over a 30-Minute Period\n- The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of CUBICIN over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h to healthy young adults are summarized in \n- Daptomycin pharmacokinetics were generally linear and time-independent at CUBICIN doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for up to 14 days.  Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose.  The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg q24h were 5.9 (1., 6.7 (1., 10.3 (5., 12.9 (2., and 13.7 (5. mcg/mL, respectively.\n- CUBICIN Administered over a 2-Minute Period\n- Following IV administration of CUBICIN over a 2-minute period to healthy volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N= and 6 mg/kg (N=, the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475  and 701  mcgh/mL, respectively.  Values for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study.  However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy volunteers who received a single dose of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state Cmax values were simulated for CUBICIN 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period.  The simulated mean (SD) steady-state Cmax values were 77.7 (8. and 116.6 (12. mcg/mL, respectively.\n- Distribution\n- Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner.  The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%.\n- In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in subjects with creatinine clearance (CLCR) ≥30 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects with normal renal function.  However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CLCR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%).  The protein binding of daptomycin in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects.\n- The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose.\n- Metabolism\n- In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes.\n- In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay.  Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations.  In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of CUBICIN at 6 mg/kg to subjects.  Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine.  The site of metabolism has not been identified.\n- Excretion\n- Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys.  In a mass balance study of 5 healthy subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity.\n- Specific Populations\n- Renal Impairment\n- Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections  and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected subjects with various degrees of renal function .  Total plasma clearance (CLT), elimination half-life (t1/, and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  Following administration of CUBICIN 4 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CLT was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CLCR50–80 mL/min), moderate (CLCR 30–80 mL/min).  The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t1/2, and Vss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CLCR 30–80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function.  The mean AUC for patients with CLCR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function.  The mean Cmax ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CLCR ≥30 mL/min, while the mean Cmax for patients with CLCR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL.  After administration of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean Cmaxranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.\n- Because renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, adjustment of CUBICIN dosage interval is necessary in patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min) .\n\n【4】 # Hepatic Impairment\n- The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy volunteers (N= matched for gender, age, and weight.  The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.  No dosage adjustment is warranted when CUBICIN is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated.\n\n【5】 # Gender\n- No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed.  No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when CUBICIN is administered.\n\n【6】 # Geriatric\n- The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (≥75 years of age) and 11 healthy young controls (18 to 30 years of age).  Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of CUBICIN by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC0-∞ was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young subjects.  There were no differences in Cmax .\n\n【7】 # Obesity\n- The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index  25 to 39.9 kg/m and 6 extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function.  Following administration of CUBICIN by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls.  The AUC0-∞ of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls.  The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin.  No adjustment of CUBICIN dosage is warranted in obese patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric\n- The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric populations (<18 years of age) have not been established .\n\n【9】 # Drug-Drug Interactions\n- In Vitro Studies\n- In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4.  It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system.\n- Aztreonam\n- In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the Cmax and AUC0-∞ of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam.\n- Tobramycin\n- In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of CUBICIN 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when CUBICIN was coadministered with tobramycin.  The mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with CUBICIN.  These differences were not statistically significant.  The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of CUBICIN is unknown.\n- Warfarin\n- In 16 healthy subjects, administration of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio).\n- Simvastatin\n- In 20 healthy subjects on a sdaily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of CUBICIN 4 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N= had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N= .\n- Probenecid\n- Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of CUBICIN 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period did not significantly alter the Cmax or AUC0-∞ of daptomycin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#3#3#adults are summarized in\nDaptomycin pharmacokinetics是一句话不需要换行", "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#9#9#(N=内容缺失不完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-09 22:16:59"}

This document presents the key recommendations and a summary of the supporting evidence.\n- It is not intended as a comprehensive operational manual on the assessment of iron status or an implementation tool for the conduct of a micronutrient survey.\n A guide for programme managers  . This guideline aims to help WHO Member States and their partners to make evidence-informed decisions on the appropriate use of indicators for assessing a population's iron status and application of the use of ferritin concentrations for monitoring and evaluating iron intervention programmes, in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals  and the global targets as put forward in the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition , endorsed by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly in 2012, in resolution WHA65.6, and the Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health  .\n\n【1】 # Population of interest\n- The guideline will affect all individuals and population groups at the public health level.\n\n【2】 # Priority questions\n- The following key questions were posed, based on the policy and programme guidance needs of Member States and their partners. The population, indicator, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format was used, when appropriate.\n\n【3】 # Outcomes of interest\n- The outcomes of interest considered critical for decision-making included the following:\n- accurate diagnosis of the risk of iron deficiency (using <12 µg/L, <15 µg/L, <30 µg/L and other commonly used cut-off values) (question ;\n- accurate diagnosis of the risk of iron overload (question ;\n- change in ferritin concentrations with iron interventions (question ;\n- change in the prevalence of iron deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia or iron overload with iron interventions (as defined by trialist) (question ;\n- the sensitivity of ferritin methods (question ;\n- the specificity of ferritin methods (question ;\n- the predictive value of ferritin methods (question ;\n- the cost/financial feasibility of ferritin methods (question ;\n- the limit of detection of ferritin methods (question ;\n- the relationship between acute phase proteins and ferritin concentrations (question ;\n- the median difference in the percentage change in prevalence of iron deficiency with different correction factors (question ;\n- the range of prevalence of deficiency when applying different correction factors for inflammation compared to no correction (question ;\n- the validity of different correction factors (question ;\n- the precision of different correction factors (question ;\n- the feasibility of different correction factors (question ; and - correlation coefficients of ferritin concentrations with measures of country/individual development, for determining the magnitude of iron deficiency as a public health problem (question .\n- The key questions and outcomes guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations in this guideline are listed in Annex 1.\n\n【4】 # Target audience\n- The recommendations in this guideline are intended for a wide audience, including health professionals, clinicians, researchers, managers of nutrition and health programmes, and public health policy-makers, their expert advisers, and technical and programme staff at government institutions and organizations involved in the design and conduct of surveys to assess micronutrient status in all settings.\n- The end-users of this guideline are:\n- national and local policy-makers; - implementers and managers of national and local nutrition programmes; - nongovernmental and other organizations and professional societies involved in the planning and management of nutrition actions and the surveillance of nutrition status; and\n- health professionals, including clinicians, researchers, managers of nutrition and health programmes and public health policy-makers in all settings.\n\n【5】 # Iron deficiency and iron overload\n have important deleterious consequences on health if left untreated . Owing to its high reactivity, iron is always bound to a protein, depending on its role and location in the body. Iron circulates in the plasma bound to transferrin, is stored in cells as ferritin, and functions as part of haemoglobin or myoglobin molecules.\n\n【6】 # Iron deficiency\n impair iron absorption, which may mediate iron deficiency in athletes . The most common cause of blood loss is menstruation, which is the primary reason that iron deficiency is more common in women. In low-income settings, other important causes include chronic blood loss from hookworm and schistosomiasis. In all settings, blood donation  and bleeding from intestinal lesions  must be considered. Iron requirements are increased during growth (especially in infants and children under 5 years of age) and adolescence, while iron requirements during pregnancy are increased due to iron needs for maternal and fetal erythropoiesis and fetal growth.\n been estimated that, worldwide, 273 million preschool-age children have anaemia (43% of all children, 42% of cases responsive to iron); 32 million pregnant women have anaemia (38% of all pregnant women, 50% of cases responsive to iron); and 496 million non-pregnant women have anaemia (29% of all non-pregnant women, 50% of cases responsive to iron). Anaemia is most prevalent in central and west Africa and south Asia .\n\n【7】 # Iron overload\n less commonly by mutations in genes that encode haemojuvelin transferrin receptor 2  and ferroportin; conditions associated with ineffective erythropoiesis (for example thalassaemia intermedia and haemoglobin E-beta thalassaemia); and iron accumulation from repeated red cell transfusions, usually to treat inherited (e.g. thalassaemia and other congenital conditions) or acquired (e.g. aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia) anaemia .\n- Over time, iron overload results in excess iron accumulation in organs, especially the liver (resulting in cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma), endocrine organs (causing pituitary and gonadal failure), pancreas (causing diabetes), skin (causing pigmentation) and heart (resulting in cardiomyopathy, heart failure and arrhythmia). Untreated, most patients with severe iron overload succumb to cardiac or hepatic complications. Thus, early diagnosis and non-invasive tests for monitoring treatment are essential to optimal management of iron overload . The global burden of iron overload is uncertain and varies by population (ethnicity, age and sex), as well as the methodology used for estimation (screening with ferritin, transferrin saturation or genetic testing). The prevalence of hereditary haemochromatosis in Caucasian populations has been estimated to be 3.5 to 4.5 per 1000 population with clinical expression, being greater in males than females .\n\n【8】 # Assessment of iron status\n- Indicators for the study of iron status in populations are important for determining its magnitude and distribution, for deciding on intervention options, and for monitoring and evaluating the impact of implemented public health programmes. The strategy may include one or more direct or indirect interventions affecting iron status, such as nutrition education or counselling; universal or targeted provision of iron supplements; point-of-use fortification of foods with micronutrient powders containing iron; fortification of staple foods or condiments with iron and other micronutrients; deworming; and water, sanitation and hygiene.\n- The assessment of iron status is not precise, since proteins reflect the status of different compartments in the body. For example, measurement of serum ferritin assesses storage iron .\n- As these biomarkers are affected by other conditions such as age, sex, disease, smoking, infection and inflammation, it may be difficult to identify a unique indicator of iron status.\n- Ferritin is the primary iron-storage protein and is critical to iron homeostasis . The ferritin molecule is an intracellular hollow protein shell, composed of 24 subunits surrounding an iron core that may contain as many as 4000-4500 iron atoms. In the body, small amounts of ferritin are secreted into the blood circulation. In the absence of inflammation, the concentration of this plasma (or serum) ferritin is positively correlated with the size of the total body iron stores .\n- To determine its usefulness to detect low iron reserves or iron deficiency in populations, the concentration of ferritin can be compared to iron contained in the bone marrow . The absence of stainable iron on a bone marrow aspirate that contains spicules is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In some studies, however, bone marrow aspirates have failed to detect iron deficiency, suggesting methodological and interpretation limitations .\n- On the other side of the spectrum, liver biopsies have commonly been used to detect iron overload, because the liver is the dominant iron-storage organ; liver iron concentration correlates closely with the total iron balance; and the liver is the only organ in which the iron concentration is elevated in all forms of systemic iron overload  and computerized tomography .\n\n【9】 # Ferritin cut-off values\n- Definitive identification of iron status for a patient requires invasive or expensive studies and is generally not available in public health or primary care settings. Iron deficiency is considered to exist when bone marrow iron staining is absent, but bone marrow aspiration cannot be routinely used in the population health context and is often unaccepto patients in routine clinical practice. Iron overload can be assessed by histological assessment of accumulation of iron in tissues .\n raised in inflammation with or without infection, liver disease, obesity, and some rare haematological conditions. Inflammation can distort interpretation of ferritin concentrations, obscure the diagnosis of iron deficiency and be misleading in the diagnosis of iron overload . Clinical or biochemical assessment for concomitant inflammation is therefore essential, but optimal adjustments of ferritin measures to account for inflammation remain uncertain .\n- The existing cut-off points for serum ferritin as a measure of iron stores have been summarized by WHO . Although widely implemented and cited, these cut-off values are based on qualitative expert opinion and not a systematic appraisal of the published literature , and have not been universally adopted. A review of the literature revealed use of a broad range of cut-off values and approaches for obtaining those values .\n- Selection of appropriate cut-off values for an index that yields continuous data to indicate the dichotomous presence or absence of disease necessitates trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. The optimal cut-off point depends on the task of the test: for example, for a screening test, or when the outcome of a false-positive result is not severe, a cut-off value that provides a higher sensitivity would be appropriate. Conversely, if a false-positive outcome puts the patient or population at risk, a cut-off value with higher specificity is preferable. The diagnostic properties of selected thresholds are useful to the end-user to enable appropriate interpretation .\n\n【10】 # Clinical pathways for iron deficiency and overload\n- Evaluation of iron status may be performed clinically, for individual patients, or across a population. Measurement of iron status in individuals is important to correctly define iron status and provide appropriate treatment for iron deficiency; to prompt further testing and management if iron overload is suspected; and to monitor interventions for both iron deficiency and iron overload. Measurement of iron status in populations is important to determine the prevalence and distribution of iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in the population, and thus to decide appropriate interventions, and to monitor and evaluate the impact and safety of implemented public health programmes .\n consider other markers of iron metabolism and clinical conditions. A clinical pathway for investigation of iron deficiency is proposed in Fig. 1. For iron overload, a positive ferritin test  and, potentially, unnecessary treatment with phlebotomy or chelators. The clinical pathway for iron overload with ferritin is depicted in Fig. 2.\n\n【11】 # Ferritin assays\n\n【12】 - Since ferritin concentration is widely used as marker of iron stores and status, it is important to determine whether all commonly used methods can detect and discriminate the full range of iron status (deficiency, repletion and overload), and to assess the comparability of methods across measurement systems.\n\n【13】 # History of the project on the use of ferritin for the assessment of iron status\n- There are previous WHO documents on the use of ferritin for the assessment of iron status in populations from consultations held in 1987 and 1993 .\n be useful to measure the concentration of one or both of the acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) or α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), to account for a high serum ferritin caused by inflammation, as well as measuring transferrin receptor during repeated surveys.\n\n【14】 # Meetings on the ferritin project\n\n【15】 # WHO guideline development group meeting: Use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Panama City, Panama 15-17 September 2010\n- WHO convened the first guideline development group meeting in Panama City, Panama in 2010, on priorities in the assessment of vitamin A and iron status in populations , to discuss and initiate the work of updating WHO guidelines on indicators for the assessment of vitamin A and iron status. With regard to the assessment of iron status, serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor were ranked of highest priority for undergoing a thorough review.\n- Starting in 2013, WHO developed a project for retrieving, summarizing and assessing the evidence to inform WHO recommendations on the use and interpretation of serum/plasma ferritin concentrations for assessing iron status in populations. Five protocols were initially developed to answer specific topics, through systematic reviews of published data and analysis of raw data from international databases. These protocols are listed next.\n- Serum/plasma ferritin for assessing iron status in populations. This protocol examined whether ferritin concentration reflects all possible iron statuses (deficiency, repletion and overload) and what the cut-off points are to define each iron status. This protocol searched for the association of serum/plasma ferritin with other measures of iron stores, as indicated by bone marrow aspirates, haemoglobin, blood smears and liver biopsies.\n\n【16】 # How ferritin concentration responds to nutrition interventions.\n- The aim was to summarize systematic reviews that assess the effects of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions on ferritin concentrations, particularly in children aged 6-59 months, school-age children and pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n- The use of ferritin concentrations in defining levels of public health concern with respect to the iron status of populations. The objective was to describe the magnitude and distribution of iron deficiency as measured by ferritin concentration in different regions of the world, to inform guidelines and to define ranges, severities and proportions of iron deficiency at national or regional levels.\n\n【17】 # WHO/CDC technical consultation: Ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Emory University, Atlanta, United States of America (USA) 3-5 March 2014\n- WHO, in collaboration with CDC, convened a technical consultation to validate the methodological approach to retrieve, summarize and assess the evidence to inform future guidelines on the use of ferritin as an indicator of iron status in populations, including cut-off points to define iron deficiency, repletion and overload in different population groups. Experts in the areas of ferritin methodology, immunology, nutrition and programme implementation met with authors of the meta-analyses, to discuss the draft review protocols and any preliminary results.\n\n【18】 # Meeting: Review of evidence to inform WHO/CDC guidelines on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Geneva, Switzerland 4-5 December 2014\n- WHO, in collaboration with CDC, convened a meeting with the authors of the reviews and invited guests to discuss the outcomes of the reviews and draft recommendations in preparation for a meeting of the WHO guideline development group. The objectives were to describe the WHO guideline development process; present results of each of the reviews for informing the WHO/CDC guideline on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations; and discuss results and develop a draft guideline for consideration by the WHO guideline development group.\n\n【19】 # Meeting: Review of evidence to inform WHO/CDC recommendations on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Bethesda, USA 6-8 May 2015\n- This meeting was held in collaboration with CDC and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The objectives were to present preliminary results of each of the five protocols, retrieving evidence for informing the WHO/CDC recommendations on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, and to discuss the results and main conclusions of the findings .\n\n【20】 # Meeting: Review of evidence to inform WHO recommendations on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Geneva, Switzerland 3-4 March 2016\n- WHO, in collaboration CDC, convened a review group meeting to present the final results of each of the reviews for informing the WHO recommendations on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations; discuss results and main conclusions of the findings; and draft recommendations to put forward to the WHO guideline development group .\n\n【21】 # WHO guideline development group meeting: Use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations, Geneva, Switzerland 15-17 June 2016\n- The WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety established the WHO guideline development group -ferritin, to present and discuss evidence to finalize a recommendation on the use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status in populations; determine the strength of the recommendations, considering costs, values and preferences; define implications for further research; and discus challenges for implementation of the guideline .\n\n【22】 # Why is it important for WHO to develop this guideline?\n- The WHO 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 2019-2023  focuses on delivering impact for the people at the country level, in all countries -low, middle and high income, and is based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The three strategic priorities set out in GPW13, referred to as the triple billion goals, include achieving universal health coverage, addressing health emergencies and promoting healthier populations. Nutrition, as a cross-cutting area in the health and development sectors, is an integral part of these goals . Accurate determination of iron status is crucial for diagnostic and screening purposes in the clinical setting, and to guide public health interventions at the population level. In an individual patient, diagnosis of iron deficiency or overload will help guide management, including further investigations and appropriate therapy. At the population level, determination of the magnitude and distribution of iron deficiency can help prioritize appropriate interventions in settings in which the prevalence is regarded as a severe public health problem, or help identify populations with hereditary conditions that predispose them to iron overload.\n- In support of WHO GPW13, the 2030 SDG agenda, particularly SDG2 and SDG3, and in concert with the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition  , WHO's Ambition and action in nutrition 2016-2025  aims for \"A world free from all forms of malnutrition where all people achieve health and well-being\". It defines the unique value of WHO for advancing nutrition -the provision of leadership, guidance and monitoringand proposes a theory of change. In line with these three core functions, WHO's work in nutrition will build on the outcomes of the efforts to accelerate progress towards achieving the Global Nutrition Targets .\n- This guideline is in line with GPW13, particularly in outcomes 1.1: Improved access to essential nutrition actions as part of quality essential health services; 3.1: Determinants of health addressed; 3.2: Risk factors reduced through multi-sectoral action; and 4.1: Strengthened country capacity in data and innovation .\n\n【23】 # EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n  the remarks, as well as to the evidence summary, including the considerations on implementation. Question 1. Is ferritin an adequate marker of iron stores (risk of deficiency and risk of iron overload)?\n\n【24】 # Summary of evidence\n- The evidence that informed the recommendation on ferritin as a marker of iron stores is based on three systematic reviews. The key question and outcomes guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations on this question are listed in Annex 1.\n- Is ferritin an adequate marker of iron stores (risk of deficiency and risk of iron overload)?\n- a. What is the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin compared to the gold standard in free-living populations?\n- b. What should the cut-off value be to define deficiency/excess?\n- A Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy systematic review on serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload , and a descriptive article detailing results from this review  aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload.\n- All study designs in any language seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any method in individuals of any age, sex, clinical or physiological status from any country were selected, if they compared against bone marrow iron stores for iron deficiency and against liver iron content for iron overload. Risk of bias and applicability was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)  was used to assess the certainty of the evidence and the strength of evidence for conclusions.\n- Seventy-two studies on iron deficiency and 36 on iron overload were included in the quantitative analysis. For iron deficiency, the mean ferritin concentration in healthy individuals was 15.1 μg/L (9 studies, 390 participants) when bone marrow iron content was undetec, and 70.4 μg/L (3 studies, 151 participants) when bone marrow iron was detec In non-healthy populations, mean ferritin concentrations were 82.43 μg/L for iron depletion (38 studies, 1023 participants) and 381.61 μg/L for iron sufficiency (38 studies, 1549 participants), with wide variations depending on the pathology. For iron overload, the results point to a cut-off value close to 500 μg/L, although the data were very limited.\n- Only three studies included pregnant women and none of the reported values were below 30 μg/L. In nonpregnant women (2 studies) mean ferritin concentrations when bone marrow iron content was undetecwere similar, although with a great dispersion of values: 12.5 ± 11.2 μg/L and 13.21 ± 22.41 μg/L. Accuracy estimates of the serum ferritin concentration to detect iron deficiency in healthy populations and in non-healthy populations are presented in Annex 2A and 2B. The GRADE certainty of evidence of these results is very low in both cases, owing to risk of bias, serious indirectness, and imprecision. Estimates of the accuracy of serum ferritin concentration to assess iron overload in non-healthy individuals are shown in Annex 2C. The GRADE certainty of evidence of these results is very low due to risk of bias, serious indirectness, and serious inconsistency.\n- The authors concluded that ferritin concentration is low in iron-deficient individuals and high in iron-loaded individuals, regardless of confounding clinical conditions. Current WHO thresholds for healthy populations appear valid but the data are limited for different age groups or physiological conditions. For iron overload, ferritin concentrations would only help in the presumptive diagnosis and indicate the need for further assessment.\n- A previous systematic review included 55 studies that compared laboratory tests with histological examination of the bone marrow in adults with anaemia and concluded that measurement of serum ferritin was a useful test for the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95; the authors found that a ferritin concentration <15 µg/L had a positive likelihood ratio for iron deficiency of 51.9 .\n- In 2017, a systematic review of the most commonly used ferritin cut-off values to define iron deficiency in pregnant women, and the origin of those cut-off values, was undertaken. Seventy-six studies were included in the systematic review.\n\n【25】  highlighted the need for unified international thresholds of iron deficiency for women throughout pregnancy .\n\n【26】 # Summary of the considerations of the members of guideline development group for determining the direction and strength of the recommendations\n- The guideline development group, with the support of the steering group, formulated recommendations informed by the evidence presented and with explicit consideration of the factors listed next.\n\n【27】 # Certainty of evidence\n- The overall certainty of evidence for the systematic reviews of this section is low to very low.\n\n【28】 # Balance of benefits and harms\n- Selection of appropriate cut-off values: the risks of a missed case of iron deficiency in infants and young children could mean irreversible consequences of iron deficiency and anaemia in this critical period. On the other hand, a misdiagnosed case of iron deficiency in a non-iron-deficient individual would cause unnecessary side-effects from iron therapy.\n discussed considerations about the benefits of knowing the population prevalence of iron deficiency and risk of iron overload, in order to decide in favour of or against iron interventions.\n\n【29】 # Values and preferences\n- The guideline development group discussed the relative importance of knowing iron status, from the viewpoint of the individual being assessed and inquiring about the rejection rate for blood draws in surveys for women in general, pregnant women and children under 2 years of age.\n discussed the importance of knowing whether populations are willing to receive iron interventions without knowing the risk of iron deficiency in that population.\n the acceptability for care providers or national survey coordinators of including ferritin and other markers of inflammation in the assessment.\n\n【30】  implications\n raised.\n\n【31】 # Equity and human rights\n discussion about the next steps after receiving results from a survey: referral or treatment.\n- At the population level, assessment is generally done as part of a large national survey. Considerations about the availability of laboratories in the network for assessing both ferritin and indicators of infection were addressed, and the group was informed of the WHO Global Laboratory Directory.\n- The requirement for a comprehensive regulatory framework and appropriately trained health workers was discussed. The need to facilitate the training was highlighted.\n- The available studies were not sufficient to justify a change in current ferritin cut-off values to define iron deficiency and risk of iron overload by sex or age groups. The recommended cut-off values for ferritin concentrations to define iron deficiency, including previous recommendations and new evidence when available, are presented in  b Markers of inflammation should be assessed along with the ferritin concentration, and ferritin adjusted as necessary.\n- For the purposes of this guideline, an apparently healthy individual is defined as an individual with physical well-being for their age and physiological status, without detecdiseases or infirmities.\n- d In adult, non-healthy populations, a ferritin concentration exceeding 500 µg/L may indicate risk of iron overload or other disease. This cut-off value indicates the need for further clinical and laboratory evaluation to establish the diagnosis and underlying cause of the ferritin levels.\n- e There are several physiological changes occurring in pregnancy that may contribute to the variation in thresholds of iron deficiency in pregnancy as defined by serum ferritin, including a physiological rise in acute phase proteins secondary to pregnancy; second trimester plasma volume expansion; and changes in inflammatory measures in the final trimester of pregnancy.\n- The remarks in this guideline are intended to give some considerations for implementation of the recommendations, based on the discussion of the guideline development group.\n- In the absence of inflammation, the concentration of plasma/serum ferritin is positively correlated with the size of the total body iron stores. Ferritin levels are low in iron-deficient individuals and high in iron-loaded individuals.\n- In populations, ferritin testing to ascertain the prevalence of iron deficiency or to determine the risk of iron overload is usually performed along with haemoglobin testing to assess the prevalence of anaemia. Measures of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein  and/or α-1 acid glycoprotein and additional iron indices, such as soluble transferrin receptor, are commonly used.\n- The physiological changes occurring in hormones, blood composition and haemodynamics, as well as in inflammatory status during pregnancy, render it difficult to establish a fixed, unique ferritin concentration to define iron deficiency, especially when comparing to an invasive gold standard test such as bone marrow biopsy.\n- Ferritin may be elevated due to iron overload or other causes, including liver disease, obesity, inflammation and malignancy. In cases of risk of iron overload, ferritin concentration only indicates the possibility of iron overload and the need for further assessment of the specific diagnosis, and the severity of the problem.\n- Liver biopsies have commonly been used to report iron overload, because the liver is the dominant iron-storage organ, liver iron concentration correlates closely with the total iron balance, and the liver is the only organ in which the iron concentration is elevated in all forms of systemic iron overload. Non-invasive methods such as magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography are widely used to assess iron content in the liver.\n\n【32】 # Question 2. Is ferritin an adequate marker for assessing the impact of iron interventions?\n\n【33】 # Summary of evidence\n- The evidence that informed the recommendation on ferritin response to nutrition interventions is basesd on one overview of systematic reviews and one systematic review. The key question and outcomes guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations on this question are listed in Annex 1.\n- Is ferritin an adequate marker for assessing the impact of iron interventions?\n- a. If yes, when should it be measured?\n- An overview of systematic reviews was commissioned to address the question on how ferritin concentration responds to nutrition interventions. The objective was to summarize the effects of nutrition-specific and nutritionsensitive iron interventions on serum ferritin concentration among relatively healthy populations of children aged 6 months and older and women of reproductive age and to explore the consistency in results across environments and intervention designs, following Cochrane methodology for an overview of reviews. The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42014008926 .\n- The search included peer-reviewed systematic reviews with meta-analyses without date, geographic or language restrictions, on apparently healthy populations that included children aged 6 months to adolescence and/or women of reproductive age who received nutrition-specific and/or nutrition-related interventions. The methodological quality of each meta-analysis was measured using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. This review did not include individual studies or assessments of eligibility or of risk of bias, and did not involve additional meta-analyses of the results extracted from the systematic reviews.\n- Ten meta-analyses were selected, covering four types of interventions: supplementation (6 studies); food fortification (1 study); supplementation + fortification (1 study); late versus early cord clamping (1 study); and anthelmintic treatment (1 study). In all cases, serum ferritin concentration consistently increased in response to interventions.\n- This overview is limited by the fact that results were extracted from available systematic reviews, and no additional analyses were performed. Therefore, while this overview provides support that ferritin concentration consistently responds positively to interventions designed to improve iron status, it is not possible to describe the differential impact of various intervention designs, such as iron supplementation dose or duration, on the change in ferritin status (66; Merrill R, Mei Z, personal communication, 10 February .\n914-1.263, P < 0., serum iron (Hedges' g = 1.004, 95% CI: 0.828-1.181, P < 0. and transferrin saturation (Hedges' g = 0.741, 95% CI: 0.564-0.919, P < 0. and a moderate effect on improving haemoglobin concentration (Hedges' g = 0.695, 95% CI: 0.533-0.836, P < 0 Regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between the effect of iron treatment on serum ferritin and treatment duration, suggesting treatments that lasted beyond 80 days had the least effect on serum ferritin. The authors concluded that iron treatments improve the iron status and aerobic capacity of iron-deficient non-anaemic endurance athletes .\n\n【34】 # Summary of the considerations of the members of guideline development group for determining the direction and strength of the recommendations\n- The guideline development group, with the support of the steering group, formulated recommendations informed by the evidence presented and with explicit consideration of the factors listed next.\n\n【35】 # Certainty of evidence\n- The overall certainty of evidence for the systematic reviews in the overview of reviews in children and women is low by AMSTAR tool.\n\n【36】 # Balance of benefits and harms\n- For this question, the guideline development group discussed the benefits of knowing whether there is a biological response (or not) to an intervention versus the possible harms of drawing blood. Considerations included the many iron interventions being recommended in various settings and the observation that iron deficiency is still a global public health problem.\n\n【37】 # Values and preferences\n- The guideline development group discussed considerations about how countries, health-care providers or individuals value/prefer a biological measure over a functional outcome: would they prefer questions regarding intake (diet, supplementation, fortified food) or blood sampling?\n- The group raised considerations about sampling, especially considering that more than one blood sample would be required from each individual.\n\n【38】  implications\n- The guideline development group agreed that, overall, the implementation of nutrition interventions requires important resources (surveys, drawing blood, transport to laboratory, supplies, assays, human resources, supplements), but the impact is worth the costs.\n- The guideline development group agreed that the impact of iron interventions could be easily analysed in different population groups (e.g. using stratifiers such as age, income group, urban/rural residence, or ethnicity).\n- Nutrition interventions are feasible and, at the population level, assessment is generally done as part of a large national survey.\n\n【39】 # Ferritin concentration increases in response to iron-related interventions and may be used to monitor and assess the impact of interventions on iron status (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).\n- Iron interventions should be implemented in such a manner as to enable monitoring to be undertaken with the lowest number of blood draws.\n- The interval following initiation of an iron intervention at which ferritin should be measured depends on the type of intervention and the amount of iron provided.\n- Comprehensive planning, monitoring and evaluation of all simultaneous interventions that increase iron intake and/or utilization and/or reduce iron losses are required to account for the total amount of iron being received by populations that would result in ferritin changes in cases of iron deficiency, and to avoid risk of iron overload.\n- Knowledge of the prevalence of infection/inflammation is critical for interpretation of ferritin concentrations in population surveys and to interpret changes after iron interventions.\n- The inclusion of markers to diagnose iron-related genetic disorders is valuable, especially in regions where thalassaemias and other haemoglobinopathies are common.\n- Cases of iron overload should be treated at individual level, since high ferritin concentrations are not sensitive to the effects of nutrition interventions.\n- More research is needed to evaluate the effect of nutrition interventions on ferritin concentration through the life-cycle, especially during pregnancy, owing to changes in concentration, especially the typical decrease in concentration in late pregnancy.\n\n【40】 # Question 3. How should ferritin be measured?\n\n【41】 # Summary of evidence\n- The evidence that informed the recommendation on methods to measure ferritin is basesd on one systematic review. The key question and outcomes guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations on this question are listed in Annex 1.\n- How should ferritin be measured?\n- a. What assays are available?\n- b. What biological samples are accepfor analysis (plasma/serum/dried blood spots from venous or capillary blood)?\n- A systematic review analysed the performance and comparability of the most common laboratory methods used for determination of serum or plasma ferritin concentration to detect iron deficiency, repletion or overload. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, under the number CRD42016036222 . The objectives were to determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value among ferritin methods; to assess the variability of serum or plasma ferritin concentrations using different laboratory methods of detection; and to review the use of international standard materials of ferritin for calibration purposes and in global public health surveillance .\n- Two hundred and fifty-two studies were assessed, including 187 studies in the qualitative analysis and 148 in the meta-analysis. The most used methods for determination of ferritin in plasma or serum included radiometric, nonradiometric and agglutination assays. The overall within-run imprecision for the most reported ferritin methods was 6.2 ± 3.4% (95% CI: 5.69-6.70%; n = , between-run imprecision 8.9 ± 8.7% (95% CI: 7.44-10.35%; n =  and recovery rate 95.6% (95% CI: 91.5-99.7%; n = . The pooled regression coefficient was 0.985 among all methods analysed, and 0.984 when comparing nonradiometric and radiometric methods, without statistical differences in ferritin concentration ranging from 2.3 μg/L to 1454 μg/L.\n- There was no significant difference in within-run imprecision, between-run imprecision, limit of detection, recovery rate or linearity between commercial and home-made assays, or between automated multiple-analytes detection equipment and single laboratory apparatus, showing, overall, that the methods used in the included studies, whether commercial or home-made assays, and the use of automated or single apparatus equipment for detection, made no difference for ferritin determinations.\n\n【42】 # Summary of the considerations of the members of guideline development group for determining the direction and strength of the recommendations\n- The guideline development group, with the support of the steering group, formulated recommendations informed by the evidence presented and with explicit consideration of the factors listed next.\n\n【43】 # Certainty of evidence\n- The quality of publications, especially for automated and commercial assays, is low. In many cases, they are only reports or abstracts from scientific meetings that did not result in formal, complete publications.\n- The use of a Diagnostic Test Accuracy approach was not possible, due to the difficulty in unequivocally identifying a gold standard method for ferritin assays to perform comparisons.\n\n【44】 # Balance of benefits and harms\n considered, and the group concluded that with small blood volumes and a limited number of samplings there are no haematological consequences from repeated blood sampling, especially for children or women.\n\n【45】 # Values and preferences\n about blood sampling from participants in a survey or nutrition intervention.\n- The group discussed considerations from laboratory personnel about preferences in methods (less time to perform, easier or more convenient) or concerns about being exposed to radioactivity. From the participants' point of view, there were considerations about sampling, especially if more than one blood sample would be required from each individual.\n\n【46】  implications\n\n【47】  discussed. If additional training is needed, is this factored in the cost estimates? .\n- Although methods are comparable and could be used interchangeably, providing they are standardized to a WHO international standard and performed by trained personnel, the group discussed differences in access to all methods and what mechanisms are in place so that those groups with limited access can be more easily reached.\n\n【48】 - The risks of radioactive contamination and the high cost of equipment are important drawbacks of radiometric assays.\n important to control other sources of error in laboratory testing related to handling of samples; transport and storage conditions; the use of manual versus automated procedures; and differences in equipment performance and those inherent to the operator.\n- Ferritin may be measured in either serum, plasma or other biological fluids, but the same sample matrix should be used when measuring the impact of interventions in individuals and at the population level.\n for evaluating and standardizing new tests for quantification of ferritin. A WHO international standard of ferritin from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, WHO International Laboratory for Biological Standards, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (NIBSC code 94/ , is commercially available and recommended for use with all assays.\n\n【49】 - Quality controls should be included with every run, or at least daily, on instruments measuring ferritin. The inclusion of quality controls of low, medium and high ferritin concentrations is desirable.\n- Laboratories performing ferritin determinations for patient care or for public health assessments should participate in external quality assurance programmes.\n\n【50】 # Question 4. Should ferritin be measured in combination with indicator(s) of infection or inflammation?\n\n【51】 # Summary of evidence\n- The evidence that informed the recommendation on adjustments of ferritin concentration for inflammation is based on two meta-analyses of data. The key question and outcomes guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations on this question are listed in Annex 1. A meta-analysis estimated the increase in ferritin in 32 studies of apparently healthy persons by using CRP and AGP, individually and in combination, to calculate factors to remove the influence of inflammation from ferritin concentrations. The studies in the meta-analysis included infants (5 studies), children (7 studies), men (4 studies) and women (16 studies) (n = 8796 subjects). Inflammation increased ferritin by 49.6% (CRP) or 38.2% (AGP; both P < 0 In 4-group analysis, ferritin was 30%, 90% and 36% (all P < 0. higher in the incubation, early convalescence and late convalescence subgroups, respectively, with corresponding correction factors of 0.77, 0.53 and 0.75. Overall, inflammation increased ferritin by approximately 30% and was associated with a 14% (95% CI: 7-21%) underestimation of iron deficiency. The authors concluded that measures of both APP and CRP are needed to estimate the full effect of inflammation and can be used to correct ferritin concentrations. Few differences were observed between age and sex subgroups .\n- Another meta-analysis assessed the relation between ferritin concentrations and inflammation and malaria in preschool children (6-59 months) and women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and investigated adjustment algorithms to account for these effects. Cross-sectional data from 15 surveys for preschool children (n = 27  and 8 surveys for women of reproductive age (n = 24 , from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia project (BRINDA) were analysed. Several approaches were explored to estimate depleted iron stores (ferritin concentration 5 μg/L or AGP concentrations >1 g/L; and (iii) apply arithmetic correction factors; and (iv) use a regression correction approach.\n- Results show that estimates of depleted iron stores incrementally increased as CRP and AGP deciles decreased (4% compared with 30%, and 6% compared with 29% from the highest compared with lowest CRP deciles for pooled preschool children and women of reproductive age, respectively, with similar results for AGP). Depending on the approach used to adjust for inflammation (CRP plus AGP), the estimated prevalence of depleted iron stores increased by 7-25 and 2-8 absolute median percentage points for preschool children and women of reproductive age, respectively, compared with unadjusted values. Adjustment for malaria in addition to CRP and AGP did not substantially change the estimated prevalence of depleted iron stores.\n- The authors concluded the value of using internal regression correction to estimate the prevalence of depleted iron stores in regions with inflammation. More research is warranted to validate the proposed approaches, but this study contributes to the evidence base to guide decisions about how and when to adjust ferritin for inflammation .\n\n【52】 # Summary of the considerations of the members of guideline development group for determining the direction and strength of the recommendations\n- The guideline development group, with the support of the steering group, formulated recommendations informed by the evidence presented and with explicit consideration of the factors listed next.\n discussed.\n\n【53】 # The increase in ferritin values caused by inflammation should be accounted for in individuals and populations.\n- One method is to raise the cut-off value that defines deficiency, to 30 µg/L or 70 µg/L, depending on the age group . Another method is to exclude individuals with elevated concentrations of CRP or AGP from prevalence calculations based on ferritin. Alternatively, arithmetic or regression correction approaches may be used to adjust ferritin concentrations for inflammation and apply the cut-off points recommended for healthy populations. The adjustment that best suits the country reality should be selected and used as long as those conditions prevail (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).\n- The need for and magnitude of infection/inflammation correction depends on the population group, geographic region and other factors.\n- The application of different adjustment approaches will result in a high degree of variability in the estimated prevalence of depleted iron stores. The selected adjustment based on country conditions should be used as long as those conditions prevail.\n- Determination of both CRP and AGP concentrations may be important because they reflect different phases of the acute phase response that range from acute infection to chronic inflammation.\n- Possible adjustments include the following:\n- the higher ferritin cut-off adjustment approach uses a higher ferritin-concentration cut-off value for individuals with infection/inflammation, e.g. 5 mg/L, AGP concentration >1 g/L, or both) or individuals with malaria infection;\n\n【54】 - Ferritin adjusted = ferritin unadjusted -β 1 (CRP obs -CRP ref -β 2 (AGP obs -AGP ref -β 3 malaria\n\n【55】 - Question 5. What are the population prevalence ranges for determining a public health problem?\n\n【56】 # Summary of evidence\n- The key question guiding the evidence review and synthesis for the recommendations on this question is listed in Annex 1.\n- What are the population thresholds for determining a public health problem?\n- There is a WHO classification of anaemia as a problem of public health significance . To classify anaemia as severe, moderate, mild or no public health problem, the prevalence of anaemia should be ≥40.0%, 20.0-39.9%, 5.0-19.9% or ≤4.9%, respectively. However, there are no details on how these cut-off values were determined.\n- There are currently no population prevalence ranges for defining a public health problem using ferritin concentrations. A review (The magnitude and distribution across countries of iron deficiency using serum/plasma ferritin) was commissioned to describe the magnitude and distribution of iron deficiency as measured by serum/plasma ferritin in different regions of the world, to define ranges in the proportion of a given population below a specific cut-off level of serum/plasma ferritin for iron deficiency associated with the severity as a public health problem .\n- Two data sources were analysed: BRINDA  and the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System (VMNIS) . Data on preschool children (<5 years) and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were examined. The relationships between the prevalence of low ferritin and country gross domestic product, infant mortality rate, anaemia, maternal mortality rate (for women only), and stunting rate (for preschool children only) were examined. The authors reported that correlations between the prevalence of low ferritin and socioeconomic or health characteristics of the country were weak and not statistically significant in non-pregnant women. Correlations were stronger and statistically significant if the inflammation-adjusted prevalence of low ferritin was used in children. The authors concluded that the quartile values of prevalence of low ferritin for children and nonpregnant women could be used to define the severity of ferritin as a public health problem. No public health problem ≤4.9\n\n【57】 # IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GUIDELINE\n\n【58】 # Implementation considerations\n- As this is a global guideline, Member States are expected to adapt the recommendation according to their setting and its feasibility. Public health nutrition, and health programmes for children, women and older persons that include nutrition interventions, anaemia-control programmes and healthy diet promotion and support, require supportive policies and health-care services that enable the proper access to quality services. Other related WHO documents and manuals could be created to help with the implementation of this guideline. WHO regional and country offices assist with these processes.\n- Engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners will be critical in strengthening implementation and sustaining gains in diagnostics of iron deficiency and anaemia control. Working in collaboration with sectors involved in child, adolescent and women well-being; reproductive health; water, sanitation and hygiene; early childhood development and education; social marketing; and others can help ensure a comprehensive, cross-sectoral and more sustainable approach to knowledge of the iron staus of populations and implementation of measures to control iron deficiency or iron overload. Particular attention will be given to improving access to these guidelines \n- Accessing hard-to-reach population groups is extremely important during implementation stages, as it contributes to preventing or tackling health inequities and to furthering the realization of children's rights to health. Appropriate surveillance and monitoring systems can thus provide in\n\n【59】 # Regulatory considerations\n- As this is a global guideline, it should be adapted to the context of each Member State. Prior to implementation, a public health programme should have well-defined objectives that take into account available resources, existing policies, suidelivery platforms and suppliers, communication channels, and potential stakeholders. Ideally, the intervention should be implemented as part of an integrated programme on nutrition and health that includes addressing iron deficiency and anaemia. This recommendation should be framed under the existing national strategy on prevention and control of iron deficiency and anaemia and/or micronutrient deficiencies. The choice of an intervention to prevent micronutrient deficiencies should be considered in the context of that strategy, including consideration of the costs, feasibility, accessibility and acceptability among the different stakeholders (e.g. decision-makers, law-makers, programme managers, manufacturers, industry organizations, importers, exporters, retailers, consumers' organizations, organizations with opposing views). A mapping exercise of the different stakeholders and their interests and form of involvement in the intervention is a useful practice .\n- Once the programme is defined for public health and for individual treatment, the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) compiles medicines that satisfy the priority health-care needs and are selected with due regard to disease prevalence, evidence on efficacy and safety, and comparative cost effectiveness .\n\n【60】 # Ethical and equity considerations\n at the individual and societal levels; and distributing health benefits across social groups, that is, how much an intervention is contributing to health equity; and respecting and promoting the exercise of human rights.\n- An assessment of the accessibility and acceptability of a nutrition programme or survey and ferritin determinations can inform programme design and development, in order to increase therapeutic adherence to iron supplementation and the understanding and acceptance of ferritin determinations to evaluate the impact of the programme. This is particularly relevant in settings where the prevailing social norms and determinants may set unequal conditions and opportunities for different groups. For instance, in some settings, gender norms may create unequal opportunities for girls and boys at any age, both within and out of school; in other settings, social perceptions around ethnicity and race intervene in how certain population groups access and use an intervention. A comprehensive identification and assessment of the social determinants of health affecting the target groups is suggested at an early stage of implementation. Furthermore, intersectoral action is fundamental in those setting where the intervention is delivered in coordination with the education, social development or other sectors. Linking the implementation of these recommendations with other intersectoral interventions will benefit the sustainability and scale-up of the intervention.\n\n【61】 # Monitoring and evaluation of guideline implementation\n- A plan for monitoring and evaluation with appropriate indicators, including equity-oriented indicators, is encouraged at all stages. The impact of this guideline can be evaluated within countries (i.e. monitoring and evaluation of the programmes implemented at national or regional scale) and across countries (i.e. adoption and adaptation of the guideline globally).\n- \n fundamental.\n\n【62】 # RESEARCH GAPS\n- Discussions between the members of the WHO guideline development group and the external resource group highlighted the limited evidence available in some knowledge areas, meriting further research, particularly in the following areas:\n- studies comparing ferritin concentrations and bone marrow iron content in healthy, non-infected/noninflammed populations of all ages;\n- studies comparing ferritin and other iron status indicator concentrations and bone marrow iron content in the presence of biomarkers of inflammation, to validate the different approaches to adjusting iron status for inflammation;\n- well-designed, population-based longitudinal studies to define the role of other iron indicators and their response to iron interventions, which can be used to monitor the impact of public health programmes;\n- studies that clarify cut-off points for iron deficiency and the differential diagnoses when chronic or low-degree inflammation is present in older persons and conditions, such as obesity or controlled diabetes;\n- changes affecting ferritin concentrations during pregnancy and establishment of cut-off points by trimester;\n- factors affecting ferritin levels (fasting, inflammation, infection, liver disase, co-morbidities) in the general population, stratified by age, sex and physiological status, living in different settings (malaria, tuberculosis and HIV);\n- studies on the utility of ferritin concentrations to diagnose the risk of iron overload and to establish cut-off values for all age groups and settings; and\n- the comparability of ferritin concentrations among sample matrices: venous blood collection versus pooled capillary samples or dried serum spot samples.\n\n【63】 # GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n- This guideline was developed in accordance with the WHO evidence-informed guideline-development procedures, as outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development .\n- The inclusion of various sources and qualities of data improved the guideline development process by using different methods for summarizing and assessing programmatic experiences; by translating the solutions or evidence into policy, practice and products that will improve implementation; and by addressing values and preferences that will result in better strategies for communicating the guidelines to managers and policy-makers to scale-up operations.\n necessary to address the risk of iron overload at individual and at population levels and to identify a suiindicator to detect the risk.\n- Clinically, the heterogeneity in recommended and used ferritin thresholds causes confusion for clinicians and patients, while for public health, differences in thresholds impair comparison between surveys, slow development of global estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency, and obscure estimates of the effectiveness and safety of nutrition interventions. Modern processes for guideline development require a rigorous, systematic assessment of the literature, incorporating an assessment of the certainty of evidence . Thus, the evidence supporting the present ferritin thresholds requires a systematic approach to inform the recommendations on the use and interpretation of ferritin levels in clinical and public health settings.\n participated in the meetings of the guideline development group.\n\n【64】 # WHOsteeringgroup\n\n【65】 # Guideline development group\n- The Guideline development group -ferritin was established with 12 experts with a range of technical skills, diverse perspectives, wide geographic representation and gender balance. They consisted of content experts, methodologists, and representatives of potential stakeholders and beneficiaries. The list of members of the guideline development group came from suggestions from all WHO departments with an interest in the provision of scientific nutrition advice, WHO expert advisory panels, previous guideline development group memberships and those identified through a call for experts published on the WHO Nutrition website and distributed to the WHO Nutrition mailing list.\n- The WHO guideline development group -ferritin advised WHO on: (i) the scope of the guidelines and priority questions for which systematic reviews of evidence will be commissioned; (ii) the choice of important outcomes for decision-making and developing recommendations; (iii) the interpretation of evidence with explicit consideration of the overall balance of risks and benefits; and (iv) the formulation of final drafting of recommendations, taking into account existing evidence as well as diverse values and preferences.\n- The initial guideline development group meeting was held in 2010 in Panama City, Panama, where the group agreed on the general scope, key questions (including the ranking of prioritization of the outcomes) and the target audience of the guideline . In preparation for this meeting, four background papers were commissioned, one of which was on the rationale for selecting and standardizing indicators of iron status. The meeting report summarizes the discussions that occurred during the meeting and presents the background papers .\n- In a second meeting of the guideline development group in Geneva, Switzerland on 15-17 June 2016, the group examined the evidence used to inform the recommendation and appraised its certainty using the GRADE evidence profiles . The list of the guideline development group members and their areas of expertise appears in Annex 4. Regional advisers from the WHO regions participated in the meetings of the guideline development group.\n\n【66】 # External resource persons\n- The external resource persons \n\n【67】 # Systematic review teams\n- The systematic review teams provided comprehensive, objective syntheses of the evidence for each of the key questions to inform the recommendations. Advances from systematic reviews were presented in the meetings described in the section History of the project on the use of ferritin for the assessment of iron status. The final results from these systematic reviews were presented at the guideline development group meeting in Geneva in June 2016. The list of systematic reviews and authors is presented in Annex 6.\n\n【68】 # Management of conflicts of interests\n required from each prospective member of the guideline development group, as they engage in their individual capacity and not as institutional representatives.\n- The steering group reviewed the declarations-of-interest statements in conjunction with the curriculum vitae for all guideline development group members. Information from the internet or media were gathered, in order to identify any public statements made or positions held by the prospective guideline development group members and experts on the issue of iron metabolism and cut-off values for ferritin concentrations to determine iron deficiency or risk of iron overload. These were assessed for intellectual bias that may be perceived to, or actually, affect impartiality. All concerns or potential issues were discussed with the WHO Office of Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics. All potential conflicts of interest were managed on a case-by-case basis.\n- All members of the guideline development group were assessed to have no perceived or real conflicts of interests on the topic. At the beginning of both guideline development meetings, the members were asked to verbally declare their research and programme experiences and sources of funding.\n- The names of the guideline development group members, along with a description of the objectives of the meeting, were published on the WHO website, \n\n【69】 # Identification of priority questions and outcomes\n- An initial set of questions to be addressed in the guidelines was the starting point for formulating the recommendation. The questions were drafted by technical staff at WHO, based on the policy and programme guidance needs of Member States and their partners. The questions were discussed and reviewed by the steering group.\n- A meeting of the guideline development group on 15-17 September 2010 in Panama City, Panama, was held to finalize the scope of the questions and to rank the outcomes and populations of interest for the recommendation on indicators for the assessment of iron status. Serum ferritin and transferrin receptor were ranked of highest priority for undergoing a thorough review.\n- The guideline development group discussed the relevance of the questions and modified them as needed. The group scored the relative importance of each outcome from 1 to 9 (where 7-9 indicated that the outcome was critical for a decision, 4-6 indicated that it was important and 1-3 indicated that it was not important). The final key questions on this intervention, along with the outcomes that were identified as critical for decision-making, are listed in PICO format in Annex 1.\n- The population of interest included participants of any sex, age (i.e. infants, children, adults), pregnancy status or hospitalization status, in any country, although some of the questions focused on vulnerable populations, e.g. children and pregnant women. The main comparators were the risk of iron deficiency, as defined by absent iron stores in bone marrow; the risk of iron overload, as defined by excess liver iron content; the response to nutritionspecific or nutrition-sensitive interventions; the methods of ferritin determination; the role of inflammation on ferritin concentrations; and the public health significance of iron deficiency measured by ferritin. The main outcomes were accurate diagnosis of the risk of iron deficiency; accurate diagnosis of the risk of iron overload; change in ferritin concentrations and in the prevalence of iron deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia or iron overload with nutrition interventions; the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of ferritin methods; and correlations between acute phase proteins and ferritin concentrations, and between socioeconomic variables and ferritin concentrations.\n\n【70】 # Evidence identification and retrieval\n- WHO developed a project for retrieving, summarizing and assessing the evidence to inform WHO recommendations on the use and interpretation of serum/plasma ferritin concentrations for assessing iron status in populations. Five protocols were initially developed to address specific topics through systematic reviews of published data and analysis of raw data from international databases.\n- The protocols were:\n- serum/plasma ferritin for assessing iron status in populations;\n\n【71】 # how ferritin concentration responds to nutrition interventions;\n- the accuracy and comparability of methods for measuring ferritin concentration; 4. the influence of inflammation on ferritin concentrations; and 5. the use of ferritin concentrations in defining levels of public health concern with respect to the iron status of populations.\n\n【72】 # Quality assessment and grading of evidence\n- Systematic reviews based on the PICO questions were used to summarize and appraise the evidence. These reviews followed the procedures of the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions  and the Cochrane handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews . Each study included in the systematic reviews was assessed for risk of bias. This was recorded and contributed towards the assessment of the overall certainty of the evidence.\n- During the discussion and deliberations, the steering group and the guideline development group carefully reviewed the certainty, scope and study inclusion criteria for the systematic reviews. The relative weight given to the trials and non-randomized studies was taken into account when evaluating the certainty assessment for each study. When possible, the findings were synthesized with a pooled estimate of effect. The results of the systematic reviews were presented to the guideline development group, along with an assessment of the confidence in the estimates of effect for the critical outcomes.\n- Evidence profiles were prepared according to the GRADE  approach, to assess the overall certainty of the evidence . The certainty of evidence for each outcome was rated as \"high\", \"moderate\", \"low\", or \"very low\", based on a set of criteria including risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias.\n\n【73】 # Formulation of recommendations\n- The draft recommendations were discussed by the steering group and in consultation with the guideline development group, in a meeting held on 15-17 June 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland. The systematic reviews and the GRADE evidence profiles \n- For developing the recommendations, the guideline development group considered the certainty of the existing evidence, values and preferences, costs, the baseline prevalence of iron deficiency and/or anaemia and/or other nutritional deficiencies, and the equity and feasibility of implementation. The domains listed next were prepared by the steering group and discussed during the guideline development group meeting for each of the key PICO questions.\n\n【74】 # Certainty of evidence\n- The overall degree of confidence in the estimates of effect as presented in the GRADE profile was considered in the drafting of the recommendation. The higher the certainty of evidence across critical outcomes that are relevant to decision-making, the higher the likelihood is of a clear positive recommendation.\n\n【75】 # Balance of benefits and harms\n- The guideline development group evaluated the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, including the magnitude of the effects and relative importance of these consequences. Where benefits clearly outweigh harms or vice versa, the greater the likelihood is of a recommendation in favour of or against the intervention, respectively.\n- When establishing cut-off values for iron deficiency, it is important to consider what the consequences of a false-positive finding are. If they are not severe, maybe a higher sensitivity is appropriate. If a false-positive result represents a real risk for the patient population, a higher specificity is better. In day-to-day practice, this means that we don't want to deprive pregnant women or children of iron. Likewise, we don't want to give additional iron to infected populations.\n\n【76】 # Values and preferences\n- The relative importance of the outcome to the individuals or populations directly affected by the recommendation describes the values and preferences. The steering group per\n- Qualitative information on how health-care workers, service providers and end-users perceive interventions to improve iron status and to measure the impact of interventions through multiple blood samplings was analysed during the guideline development group meeting. The higher the acceptability of the intervention among stakeholders, the more likely it is that an intervention will be clearly recommended. When it was deemed necessary to recommend an intervention that is associated with low acceptability, strategies to address concerns about acceptability during implementation were discussed.\n\n【77】  implications\n- This relates to evaluation of how resource intensive and cost effective the intervention is to service users and health systems in different settings. A recommendation in favour of or against the intervention is likely where the resource implications are clearly advantageous or disadvantageous.\n- An intervention is likely to be recommended if it will reduce health inequities among different age groups and settings.\n pick up a lot of false positives. The opposite is true with a very low cut-off value. Based on this, there is a need to confirm the clinical and public health diagnostic accuracy of ferritin as an index of iron deficiency and try to identify the optimal ferritin thresholds. Where there is greater feasibility, the more likely it is that the intervention will be recommended.\n- Based on the discussions during the meeting, each recommendation was supported by a rationale, implementation considerations and research priorities. Recommendations were defined as \"strong\" or \"conditional\", based on the degree to which the guideline development group is confident in the balance between the desirable and undesirable consequences of implementing the recommendation. A strong recommendation is one for which the guideline development group is confident that the desirable effects of adherence outweigh the undesirable effects. A conditional recommendation is one for which the guideline development group concludes that the desirable effects of adherence probably outweigh the undesirable effects, although the trade-offs are uncertain.\n\n【78】 # Decision-making during the guideline development group meeting\n- The chairpersons (Dr Lindsey Allen for the first guideline development group meeting in Panama 2010; and Dr Gary Brittenham and Prof Pattanee Winichagoon for the second guideline development group meeting in Switzerland , were nominated at the opening of the consultation and the nominations were approved by the guideline development group.\n- The procedures for decision-making were established at the beginning of the meetings, including a minimal set of rules for agreement and documentation of decision-making. At least two thirds of the guideline development group members were present for an initial discussion of the evidence and proposed recommendation and remarks. By secret ballot, each member of the guideline development group noted the direction and strength of each of the recommendations, using an online form specifically designed for this purpose. Abstentions were not allowed.\n- Once voting was complete, subsequent deliberations among the members of the guideline development group could take place. If there was no unanimous consensus (primary decision rule), more time was given for deliberations and a second round of online voting took place. If no unanimous agreement was reached, a two-thirds vote of the guideline development group was required for approval of the proposed recommendation (secondary decision rule). The results from voting forms will be kept on file by WHO for up to 5 years.\n\n【79】 # Document preparation and peer-review\n- The responsible technical officer wrote the first draft of the guideline, with comments from the steering group. Technical editing and proofreading were done by a contracted party.\n- The final draft guideline was peer-reviewed by content experts, to provided technical feedback; identify errors of fact; ensure that there were no important omissions, contradictions or inconsistencies with scientific evidence or programmatic feasibility; and assist with clarifying the language, especially in relation to implementation, adaptation and contextual issues Eight potential peer-reviewers were approached after assessment of the declarations of interests. The details of the peer-reviewer appear in Annex 7.\n- The steering group reviewed all comments and revised the document, in order to ensure clarity of the recommendation while maintaining consistency with the original meaning.\n\n【80】 # DISSEMINATION AND PLANS FOR UPDATING\n- This guideline will be disseminated through electronic media such as slide presentations and the World Wide Web, through the WHO Nutrition mailing list , social media, the WHO Nutrition website  or the WHO e-Library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions (eLENA) . eLENA compiles and displays WHO guidelines related to nutrition, along with complementary documents such as systematic reviews and other evidence that informed the guidelines; biological and behavioural rationales; and additional resources produced by Member States and global partners. This guideline will be disseminated via the Bulletin of the World Health Organization , in the public health round-up section. In addition, it will be disseminated through a broad network of international partners, including WHO country and regional offices, ministries of health, WHO collaborating centres, universities, other United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations.\n- Derivative products that are useful \n\n【81】 # Plans for updating the guideline\n- The WHO Secretariat will continue to follow research developments on iron deficiency, particularly on biomarkers to detect it, with emphasis on ferritin determination and cut-off values to define iron deficiency and iron overload in different settings and age groups, and on the influence of infection/inflammation on diagnosis of iron status, particularly for questions in which the certainty of evidence was found to be low or very low. If the guideline merits an update, or if there are concerns about the validity of the guideline, the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety will coordinate the guideline update, following the formal procedures of the WHO handbook for guideline development .\n- As the guideline nears the 10-year review period, the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, along with its internal partners, will be responsible for conducting a search for new evidence.\n\n【82】 # ANNEX 2.

This protein is primarily expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.  Within the cell, it localizes to the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The enzyme has steroid 18-hydroxylase activity to synthesize aldosterone and 18-oxocortisol as well as steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase activity.

Common adverse reactions include dizziness, lightheadedness, and hyperuricemia.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【4】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n- Therapy should be initiated with the lowest possible dose, then titrated according to individual patient response. A single dose given in the morning with food is recommended; divided doses are unnecessary.\n- Dosing Information\n- Initial dose: 15 mg PO qd\n- If the response is insufficient after a suitrial, the dosage may be increased to 30 mg and then to a single daily dose of 45–50 mg.\n- If additional control is required, the addition of a second antihypertensive drug is recommended.\n- Increases in serum uric acid and decreases in serum potassium are dose-related over the 15–50 mg/day range and beyond.\n- Initial dose: Adults, initially 30–60 mg PO qd or 60 mg PO qod.\n- Some patients may require 90–120 mg at these intervals or up to 120 mg daily. Dosages above this level, however, do not usually produce a greater response.\n- Maintenance dose: maintenance doses may often be lower than initial doses and should be adjusted according to the individual patient.\n\n【5】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【6】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorthalidone in adult patients.\n\n【7】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n12.5–25 mg PO qd\n100 mg PO qd\n50–200 mg PO qd\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【9】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\n\n【10】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【11】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorthalidone in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorthalidone in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- Anuria\n- Hypersensitivity to chlorthalidone or other sulfonamide-derived drugs\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n- Thalitone (chlorthalidone USP) should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, chlorthalidone or related drugs may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.\n- Chlorthalidone should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, because minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.\n- Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.\n- The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with thiazide diuretics which are structurally related to chlorthalidone. However, systemic lupus erythematosus has not been reported following chlorthalidone administration.\n- General\n- Hypokalemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia and hypochloremic alkalosis, are common in patients receiving chlorthalidone. These abnormalities are dose-related but may occur even at the lowest marketed doses of chlorthalidone. Serum electrolytes should be determined before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. All patients taking chlorthalidone should be observed for clinical signs of electrolyte imbalance, including dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, palpitations, and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting.\n\n【15】 - Any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In cases of actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.\n- Thiazide-like diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.\n- Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazide-like drugs. Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on thiazide therapy. The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption and peptic ulceration have not been seen.\n- Uric acid\n- Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving chlorthalidone.\n- Other\n- Increases in serum glucose may occur and latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during chlorthalidone therapy. Chlorthalidone and related drugs may decrease serum protein-bound iodine (PBI) levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.\n- Laboratory Tests\n- Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.\n- All patients receiving chlorthalidone should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Chlorthalidone in the drug label.\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, chlorthalidone dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn.\n- The following adverse reactions have been observed, but there is not enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of their frequency.\n- Dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, headache, and xanthopsia\n- Orthostatic hypotension may occur and may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics.\n- Anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), and pancreatitis\n- Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia\n- Purpura, photosensitivity, rash, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (cutaneous vasculitis), and Lyell's syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, muscle spasm, weakness, restlessness, and impotence\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\n- Chlorthalidone may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs.\n- Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased or unchanged. Higher dosage of oral hypoglycemic agents may be required.\n- Chlorthalidone and related drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.\n- Chlorthalidone and related drugs may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.\n- Lithium renal clearance is reduced by chlorthalidone, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity.\n- Chlorthalidone and related drugs may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.\n\n【20】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category B\n- Pregnancy/Teratogenic Effects\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in the rat and the rabbit at doses up to 420 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to chlorthalidone. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Pregnancy/Non-Teratogenic Effects\n- Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. The use of chlorthalidone and related drugs in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in the adult.\n- The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia.\n- Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Chlorthalidone is indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes just as it is in the absence of pregnancy. Dependent edema in pregnancy resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy that is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother (in the absence of cardiovascular disease) but that is associated with edema, including generalized edema, in the majority of pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief. In rare instances, this edema may cause extreme discomfort that is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category C\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Chlorthalidone in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Chlorthalidone during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Thiazides are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from chlorthalidone, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of chlorthalidone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorthalidone with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorthalidone with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorthalidone in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorthalidone in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【30】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorthalidone in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Chlorthalidone in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Chlorthalidone in the drug label.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\n\n【37】 ## Acute Overdose\n\n【38】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of acute overdosage include nausea, weakness, dizziness and disturbances of electrolyte balance.\n- The oral LD50 of the drug in the mouse and the rat is more than 25,000 mg/kg body weight.\n- The minimum lethal dose (MLD) in humans has not been established.\n\n【39】 ### Management\n- There is no specific antidote but gastric lavage is recommended, followed by supportive treatment.\n- Where necessary, this may include intravenous dextrose-saline with potassium, administered with caution.\n\n【40】 ## Chronic Overdose\n- There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Chlorthalidone in the drug label.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Chlorthalidone is a long-acting oral diuretic with antihypertensive activity. Its diuretic action commences a mean of 2.6 hours after dosing and continues for up to 72 hours. The drug produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride. The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone and the benzothiadiazine (thiazide) diuretics appear to arise from similar mechanisms and the maximal effect of chlorthalidone and the thiazides appear to be similar. The site of the action appears to be the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone lead to decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow.\n- Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not wholly clear, sodium and water depletion appear to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect. Like the thiazide diuretics, chlorthalidone produces dose-related reductions in serum potassium levels, elevations in serum uric acid and blood glucose, and it can lead to decreased sodium and chloride levels.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Thalitone (chlorthalidone USP) is an antihypertensive/diuretic supplied as 15 mg ts for oral use. It is a monosulfamyl diuretic that differs chemically from thiazide diuretics in that a double ring system is incorporated in its structure. It is a racemic mixture of 2-chloro-5-(1-hydroxy-3-oxo-1-isoindolinyl) benzenesulfonamide, with the following structural formula:\n- Chlorthalidone is practically insoluble in water, in ether and in chloroform; soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in alcohol.\n- The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The mean plasma half-life of chlorthalidone is about 40 to 60 hours. It is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug in the urine. Non-renal routes of elimination have yet to be clarified. In the blood, approximately 75% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Thalitone (chlorthalidone USP) has been formulated with PVP (povidone polyvinylpyrrolidone), a bioavailability enhancer that provides 104% to 116% bioavailability relative to an oral solution of chlorthalidone. Thalitone cannot be substituted for other formulations of chlorthalidone and likewise, other formulations of chlorthalidone cannot be substituted for Thalitone.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Chlorthalidone in the drug label.\n\n【47】 # Clinical Studies\n- There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Chlorthalidone in the drug label.\n\n【48】 # How Supplied\n- White, kidney-shaped, compressed ts coded M/024 containing 15 mg of chlorthalidone in bottles of 100 (NDC 61570-024-.\n- Storage: Store below 30°C (86°F).\n\n【49】 ## Storage\n- There is limited information regarding Chlorthalidone Storage in the drug label.\n\n【50】 # Images\n\n【51】 ## Drug Images\n\n【52】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n\n【53】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should inform their doctor if they have:\n- Allergic reaction to chlorthalidone or other diuretics\n- Asthma\n- Kidney disease\n- Liver disease\n- Gout\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus\n- Taking other drugs such as cortisone, digitalis, lithium carbonate, or drugs for diabetes\n- Patients should be cautioned to contact their physician if they experience any of the following symptoms of potassium loss: excess thirst, tiredness, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, nausea, vomiting or increased heart rate or pulse.\n be cautioned that taking alcohol can increase the chance of dizziness occurring.\n\n【54】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Orthostatic hypotension may occur and may be aggravated by alcohol.

In patients with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, vigorous physical activity triggers acute narrowing of the airways and is measured by the number of sputum eosinophils. E.I.A. shares many features with other types of asthma, and responds to some typical asthmatic medications, but does not appear to be caused by the same inflammatory reaction as the other types.\n\n【2】 # Pathophysiology\n\n【3】 ## Triggering Factors\n- Exposure to cold or dry air\n- Bronchial hyperresponsiveness\n- Increased duration and intensity of exercise\n- Concomitant viral infection\n- Environmental allergen\n\n【4】 ## Pathogenesis\n- The underlying pathogenesis for E.I.A. is poorly understood.\n- E.I.A usually occurs after at least several minutes of vigorous, aerobic activity, which demands supplementation of normal nasal breathing with mouth breathing. The resultant inhalation of air is neither warmed to bod temperature or humidified by the nasal passages; hence, seems to generate increased blood flow to the linings of the bronchial tree, resulting in edema and subsequent constriction of these bronchial vessels, worsening the degree of obstruction to airflow. This sequence generates symptoms similar to those seen in other forms of asthma, but occurs without the inflammatory changes that underlie them.\n\n【5】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The prevalence of E.I.A in the general population is approximately 7-20%. The majority of asthmatics with symptomatic disease have some degree of exercise induced asthma.\n\n【6】 # Diagnosis\n\n【7】 ## History and Symptoms\n- Initial bronchodilation occurs 6-8 minutes after exercise with subsequent bronchospasm and completely resolves within an hour. During this approximate one hour period, resumption of exercise will likely produce either none or mild symptoms.\n- In most cases, a relative refractory period follows resolution of an attack and is thought to be secondary to the release of inhibitory prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2.\n- Most often than not, approximately 6-10 hours after an initial attack, a rebound attack with milder symptoms often develops without precipitating exertion.\n- Severe attacks are often the result of someone with both, allergic and exercise-induced asthma exercising in a high-allergen environment (e.g. walking uphill alongside slowly moving traffic at dusk) and can be fatal.\n- Common symptoms include:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Cough\n- Wheeze\n- Altered metal status may be the presentation in severe attacks\n\n【8】 ## Physical Examination\n\n【9】 ### Vital Signs\n- Tachypnea\n- Tachycardia\n\n【10】 # HEENT\n- Cyanosis secondary to severe hypoxia\n\n【11】 ### Lungs\n- High-pitch prolong expiratory wheeze that may be audible even without a stethoscope.\n\n【12】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n\n【13】 # Exercise Challenge Test\n- Exercise challenge test is a direct method to establish diagnosis. Test is considered positive if a 10% reduction in FEV1 is observed after a 6-8min treadmill exercise.\n- In athletes, documentation of airway narrowing in response to exercise, aids in the diagnosis and management of asthma by providing evidence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness that will respond to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and is usually associated with a reduction in respiratory symptoms on exercise.\n\n【14】 # Treatment\n\n【15】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The major goal of therapy in exercise-induced asthma is to ensure exercise is not avoided.\n- In athletes who wish to continue their sport, and/or do so at times in adverse conditions, preventive measures, including altered training techniques and medications, can be taken.\n- Some athletes take advantage of the refractory period by precipitating an attack by \"warming up\" and then timing their competition such that it occurs during the refractory period. Step-wise training works in a similar fashion. An athlete warms up in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to get up to a full workload.\n- Therapy should be routinely monitored with the assessment of peak expiratory flow rate performed before and after the exercise. Methacholine challenge test is another alternative to objectively assess response to therapy.\n- Fish oil supplementation may represent a potentially beneficial non-pharmacologic intervention for patients with exercise-induced asthma.\n- The most common medication approach is to use a beta agonist about twenty minutes before exercise.\n- Equipotent doses of the bronchodilators such as salmeterol, formoterol and terbutaline have shown to be effective with respect to their short-term protective potency against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.\n- Tachyphylaxis developed to the protective effect of long and short-acting beta-2 agonist and hence is less effective when used for exercise-induced asthma. However, it remains extremely effective in the prevention of bronchospasm when used immediately before exercise.\n- Nedocromil and cromolyn administered by a pressurized aerosol has shown to provide equal protection against exercise-induced asthma in children. A small randomized study, has shown the additive effects of combining cromolyn and beta-2 agonist and may be indicated in high-performance athletes. Nedocromil sodium used before exercise has shown to reduce the severity and duration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.\n- Inhaled corticosteroids used for weeks and months before exercise significantly attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; however, it does not provide any short-term benefit.\n- Montelukast has shown to provide significant protection against exercise-induced asthma and further reduce the urinary excretion of leukotriene that is commonly observed after exercise. However, leukotriene inhibitors are not effective in all patients with exercise induced asthma.\n- Other pharmacological agents that have been hypothesized to provide therapeutic benefits in patients with exercise induced asthma include frusemide, prostaglandin-E2, indomethacin, and heparin.\n- As evidenced by the many professional athletes who have overcome E.I.A. using some combination of the above treatments, the prognosis is usually very good.\n- Olympic swimmers Tom Dolan, Amy Van Dyken, and Nancy Hogshead, baseball Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter, and American football player Jerome Bettis are among the many who have done so.\n- At the same time, it should be noted that according to International Olympic Committee statistics, during most of Olympic Games in last 20 years from 1/3 to 2/3 of athletes claimed to have asthma.\n- Some medical experts tie such inordinate rates of reported asthma with athletes' desire to use complex medication to help them achieve better results.\n\n【16】 # Futureor Investigational Therapies\n- A randomized crossover study compared oral montelukast with inhaled salmeterol, both given two hours before exercise. Both drugs had similar benefit but montelukast lasted 24 hours.\n- In a large randomized study in children, monotherapy with montelukast and combination therapy with montelukast and budesonide yielded higher beneficial results in comparison to budesonide monotherapy and combined therapy with budesonide and formoterol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:12:55"}

It depicts a nude male in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man. It is stored in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy, but is only displayed on special occasions.\n\n【1】 # Description\n- Da Vinci based his drawing on some hints at correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry in Book III of the treatise De Architectura by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, thus its name. Other artists had attempted to realize the conception, with less success. Vitruvius described as the principal source of proportion among the orders of architecture the proportion of the human \n believed by some that Leonardo symbolized the material existence by the square and spiritual existence by the circle. Thus he attempted to depict the correlation between these two aspects of human existence.\n- According to Leonardo's notes in the accompanying text, written in mirror writing, it was made as a study of the proportions of the (male) human body as described in Vitruvius, who wrote that in the human body:\n- a palm is the width of four fingersTemplate:Vitruvian Man Measurements\n- a foot is the width of four palms (i.e. 12 inches)\n- a cubit is the width of six palms\n- a man's height is four cubits (and thus 24 palms)\n- a pace is four cubits\n- the length of a man's outspread arms is equal to his height\n- the distance from the hairline to the bottom of the chin is one-tenth of a man's height\n- the distance from the top of the head to the bottom of the chin is one-eighth of a man's height\n- the maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of a man's height\n- the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand is one-fifth of a man's height\n- the distance from the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of a man's height\n- the length of the hand is one-tenth of a man's height\n- the distance from the bottom of the chin to the nose is one-third of the length of the head\n- the distance from the hairline to the eyebrows is one-third of the length of the face\n- the length of the ear is one-third of the length of the face\n- Da Vinci is clearly illustrating Vitruvius' De architectura 3.1.3 which reads:\n- The multiple viewpoint that set in with Romanticism has convinced us that there is no such thing as a universal set of proportions for the human body. The field of anthropometry was created in order to describe these individual variations. Vitruvius' statements may be interpreted as statements about average proportions. Vitruvius goes through some trouble to give a precise mathematical definition of what he means by saying that the navel is the center of the body, but other definitions lead to different results; for example, the center of mass of the human body depends on the position of the limbs, and in a standing posture is typically about 10 cm lower than the navel, near the top of the hip bones.\n departs from Vitruvius by drawing the arms raised to a position in which the fingertips are level with the top of the head, rather than Vitruvius's much higher angle, in which the arms form lines passing through the navel.\n- The drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential symmetry of the human body, and by extension, to the universe as a whole.\n- It may be noticed by examining the drawing that the combination of arm and leg positions actually creates sixteen different poses. The pose with the arms straight out and the feet together is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed square. On the other hand, the \"spread-eagle\" pose is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed circle.\n- The drawing was in the collection of Giuseppe Bossi, who illustrated it in his monograph on Leonardo's The Last Supper, Del Cenacolo di Leonardo Da Vinci libri quattro (Milan . The following year he excerpted the section of his monograph concerned with Leonardo's \"Vitruvian Man\" and published it as Delle opinioni di Leonardo da Vinci intorno alla simmetria de'Corpi Umani (Milan: Stamperia Reale, , with a dedication to his friend Antonio Canova.\n- Dedicated by the author to his friend, the neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova, this discussion of Leonardo's theory of human proportions is extracted from Bossi monograph on the Last Supper, pp. 202-26 (No. .\n- After his death in 1815 it was acquired with the bulk of his drawings by the Accademia, and later acquired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.\n\n【2】 # Representations in modern times\n- The Vitruvian Man is now used as a contemporary symbol of medical professionals and medical establishments. Many medical companies have adopted this artwork as their symbol of their group, company and or organization.\n- The medical profession and the Vitruvian Man has become somewhat synonymous with modern medical practices. The United States, Saudi Arabia, India and Germany are the countries which have widely accepted and adopted the Vitruvian Man as a symbol of medical professionalism.\n- The Vitruvian Man remains one of the most referenced and reproduced artistic images in the world today. The proportions for the human body, as proposed by Vitruvius, have inspired many other artists in drawing their version of the Vitruvian Man:\n- Cesare Ceasariano  who edited the important 1521 edition of “De Archtectura” of Vitruvius (Leonardo da Vinci is supposed to have provided the illustrations for this edition).\n- Albrecht Dürer  in his book Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion (Four books on  human proportions)\n- Pietro di Giacomo Cataneo \n- Heinrich Lautensack \n- William Blake  “Glad Day” (now known as \"Albion rose\"). This representation is without the circle and square.\n- As well as its use by the medical profession, the Vitruvian Man has been used in a variety of fictional and non-fictional media, for various symbolic purposes. For example, the image appears on the national side of Italian 1 euro coins, chosen by the Economy minister (and later President of the Italian Republic) Carlo Azeglio Ciampi for its high symbolic meaning of \"man as a measure of all things\".\n- Particularly when used in fiction, the image of the Vitruvian Man is commonly modified to suit the setting by featuring a character, a skeleton or a non-human (such as a robot in science fiction or an animal). The easily-recognisable image lends itself to being referenced.\n- Canadian heavy metal band Triumph used the image, only altered to adapt as the 'Study Of Man' in the 21st century, making it robotic and adding two heads. This image appeared as the cover of the bands seventh album, Thunder Seven\n- The cover of the In Flames album Clayman features the Vitruvian man with the band's logo, the Jesterhead, as the background.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#1#1# pp. 202-26 (No. .  没具体到内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-09 18:59:34"}

Incorporating these conversations into regular practice provides FPs with opportunities to maximize likely benefits of treatments and decrease the risk of harms, to support patients in initiating and sustaining desired lifestyle changes, and to help patients cope with the burdens of diabetes and comorbid conditions. F amily doctors and other primary care clinicians provide most of the care for Canadians living with diabetes and its complications. 1 The increasing number and complexity of cases of this chronic disease 2 provides an opportunity to ensure better supports are in place for persons with diabetes and their care providers. Given recent pharmacologic advances, as well as new evidence about the potential for specific benefits and harms, clinicians today are faced with a range of options when selecting the most appropriate treatment approach for people with diabetes. The challenge for FPs is compounded by the vast amount of new evidence available on a range of clinical topics relevant to the people with diabetes whom they see in their practices. Guidelines help to summarize evidence, but it is not feasible 3 or appropriate 4 for FPs to incorporate every single guideline recommendation relevant to primary care into practice. Which highpriority items deserve attention and action? Which recommendations should FPs make a special effort to understand and discuss with their patients?\n must be able to adopt and adhere to them whenever applicable. 6 To this end, a clinical practice guideline dissemination and implementation (D&I) committee, composed of interprofessional diabetes providers from across the country (some of whom contributed to writing the guideline but many of whom did not), was organized by Diabetes Canada to develop strategies for both people with diabetes and providers, hoping to support translating evidence-based recommendations into practice. Evaluation of the effects of these efforts is ongoing. 7 The \"Diabetes Canada 2018 clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes in Canada\" were published in April 2018. 8 As part of the dissemination effort, a series of readable articles summarizing high-priority recommendations for primary care providers and outlining easy-to-apply practices were planned. This article summarizes the new guidelines, focusing on high-priority recommendations for FPs managing people who live with type 2 diabetes. Herein, we present these guideline recommendations and link these recommendations to approaches and tools that will help FPs put them into practice.\n\n【1】 # Quality of evidence\n- Diabetes Canada is a health charity and advocacy organization that produces comprehensive national guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes in adults and children, with a focus on special populations (those with renal failure, Indigenous peoples, women of childbearing age, etc). Following a rigorous methodology, 9,10 a guideline writing committee, composed of interprofessional diabetes experts, posed then answered clinically relevant questions, resulting in a series of recommendations. 10 The evidence supporting the recommendations ranges from levels I to IV and grades A to D. 8 The Diabetes Canada guideline committee includes primary care practitioners, endocrinologists, diabetes educators, other specialists, and people living with diabetes from across Canada. The resulting diabetes guideline is reviewed and launched in a 5-year cycle, with interim revisions in the event of important practice-changing evidence and treatment options. For the 2018 guidelines, 9 of the 10 authors responsible for developing recommendations for pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes had no conflicts of interest with industry. In the case of disagreement about conflicts or outright conflicts of interest, committee members removed themselves from discussions. This article does not attempt to revise or critique the Diabetes Canada guideline recommendations but presents a family medicine-oriented approach to applying relevant recommendations in practice.\n- The guideline D&I committee co-chairs developed a process of prioritizing and distilling key messages relevant to primary care from 313 recommendations in 38 guideline chapters . 8 The prioritization was  completed anonymously by members of the guideline writing committee, people with diabetes, and members of the D&I committee. Given the large number of recommendations, the first step of the prioritization exercise was to select guideline chapters; each member was asked to select 10 chapters, then, from these chapters, to select and rank 10 recommendations. Based on the number of votes for each recommendation, a list of 22 recommendations was compiled. This was followed by thematic analysis and member checking to summarize key messages. Specifically, the co-chairs (endocrinologist C.H.Y. and FP N.M.I.) collaboratively sorted the recommendations into conceptually similar groups (themes) and drafted key messages that represented these themes. Next, they sought input from the committee members to refine the key messages, similar to the process of member checking in qualitative research. 11 For this manuscript, we sought further input from FPs on the D&I committee to ensure that no important recommendations or concepts had been missed in summarizing the high-priority aspects of the guideline for the management of people with type 2 diabetes by FPs. This involved providing these FPs with the full list of recommendations via e-mail and asking them to identify any missing high-priority recommendations. During the process of converting themes into key messages, and during the process of writing this manuscript, input was sought from members of the D&I committee who live with diabetes to ensure that the content was informed by their needs and perspectives. As a final step, the entire committee identified tools that might support implementation of the key messages. To the extent possible, tools are informed by evidence regarding implementation of evidence in practice.  Some of these tools are identified in this manuscript; these and many others can be accessed at .\n\n【2】 # Main message\n- The prioritization exercise resulted in 22 recommendations nominated for emphasis in dissemination and implementation efforts.

The guideline states that targets for HbA 1c levels and treatments should be individualized based on goals, preferences, and functional status, as described in  8 Lower targets are appropriate when priority is placed on reducing the risk of microvascular outcomes and when the treatments used do not place the patient at risk of hypoglycemia. Higher targets are appropriate when reducing the risk of long-term complications is a lower priority.

Family physicians are particularly well positioned to identify the stressors experienced by patients and to support them in addressing their highest-priority needs. More frequent visits for people struggling to achieve their goals, ideally involving a structured team-based approach, can enable more effective implementation of self-management support. 19 For those not practising in contexts with easy access to a multidisciplinary team, resources from Diabetes Canada have been developed to help implement these recommendations in practice (/reducecomplications/the-5rs), including handouts for people about self-management in general, featuring ABCDES3 for patients (/docs/patientresources/), plus handouts and practice tools that assist in identifying and managing sources of diabetes-related distress (/selfmanagement education/psychosocial).\n offers a toll-free number (1 800 BANTING), as well as a resource manual (/ financial-support-and-services), to support patients with diabetes who have low income or other need to identify local resources and services that might be helpful.\n need to change. In the context of shared decision making, where the needs and preferences of the patient are considered, FPs can periodically identify opportunities to optimize treatment so that the risk of long-term complications is minimized and to prevent immediate symptoms or side effects. The recommendations highlighted here offer guidance on how to achieve this. However, the evidence suggests that the best possible outcomes are achieved when FPs organize their diabetes care in a way that incorporates the patient-centred and evidence-based approaches of the chronic care model.\n\n【6】 # Limitations\n plausible that emergent evidence based on real-world data will identify issues with the newer agents that lead to changes in the guideline recommendations.

It is a herbaceous annual plant growing to 1m tall. The leaves at the base of the plant are simple, 2-5 cm long and shallowly lobed, while leaves higher on the stems are feathery pinnate, divided into numerous leaflets. The flowers are white, 3 mm diameter, produced in dense umbels. The fruit is an oblong dry schizocarp, 3-5 mm long.\n- Pimpinella species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the lime-speck pug and wormwood pug.\n\n【2】 # Uses\n\n【3】 ## Culinary\n- Sweet and very aromatic. Anise contains liquorice-like components.\n- Aniseed is used to make the British confectionery Aniseed balls and the old fashioned New Zealand confectionery, Aniseed wheels.\n used to make the Mexican drink atole called champurrado(similar to hot chocolate).\n- Anise oil is used to make Italian cookies called pizzelles, and used in the frosting of yellow Italian cake-like cookies called \"Drops\" or \"Anise Drops.\"\n- Anise flavouring is used in the Norwegian candy pills \"Knott\", produced by Nidar.\n- Anise toast is a dry bread popular in Italy.\n- Anise (Saunf,Badi-Sheb) is used in India as a digestive after meals.\n\n【4】 ## Medicinal uses\n- Anise leaves are used to treat digestive problems, to relieve toothache, and its essential oil is used to treat lice and scabies.\n- In aromatherapy, aniseed essential oil is used to treat colds and flu. It is being researched for the treatment of bird flu as well.\n used for flavouring some foods.\n- According to Pliny the Elder, anise was used as a cure for sleeplessness, chewed with alexanders and a little honey in the morning to freshen the breath, and when mixed with wine as a remedy for scorpion stings (N.H. 20\n- In the Middle East, aniseed is used in producing alcoholic beverages, such as Arak (Morocco) and Ouzo (Greece).\n- In Thailand it is used to flavor tea.\n\n【5】 ## Other uses\n- Anise can be made into a liquid scent and is used for both hunting and fishing. Anise smells similar to liquorice and is put on fishing lures to attract fish. Anethole, the principal component of anise oil is a precursor that can eventually produce 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde which is used in the clandestine synthesis of psychedelic drugs such as 2C-B, 2C-I and DOB.\n the main flavor of Absinthe as well as being used as a flavoring for pastis, ouzo, pernod, sambuca, Raki, Becherovka, anice tutone, Chartreuse and other liqueurs.

There is a Black Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【5】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【6】 # Indications\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for the management of pain in patients where an opioid analgesic is appropriate.\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, USP  is indicated for the management of moderate-to-severe pain in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids.\n\n【7】 # Dosage\n- General Dosing Considerations\n- Take care when prescribing and administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between the different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Take care to ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total volume of the dose.\n- Selection of patients and administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics to treat patients with acute or chronic pain, and depends upon a comprehensive assessment of the patient. Individualize treatment in every case, using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis and/or combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.\n- The nature of the pain (severity, frequency, etiology, and pathophysiology), as well as the medical status of the patient, will affect selection of the starting dosage. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF), have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks.\n- Individualization of Dosing\n- Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment. Give attention to the following:\n- The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;\n- The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;\n- The daily dose, potency, and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;\n- Concurrent medications\n- The type and severity of the patient's pain\n- Risk factors for abuse or addiction; including whether the patient has a previous or Current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of Mental illness or depression;\n- The balance between pain control and adverse reactions.\n- Periodic reassessment after the initial dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) is required. If pain management is not satisfactory, and opioid-induced adverse events are tolerable, the hydromorphone dose may be increased gradually. If excessive opioid side effects are observed early in the dosing interval, reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride dose. If this results in breakthrough pain at the end of the dosing interval, the dosing interval may need to be shortened. Dose titration should be guided more by the need for analgesia and the severity of adverse events than the absolute dose of opioid employed.\n- Initiation of Therapy in Opioid-Naïve Patients\n- Always initiate dosing in opioid-naïve patients using hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Never administer hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) to opioid-naïve patients.\n- Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration\n- The usual starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid naïve. Adjust the dose according to the severity of pain, the severity of adverse events, as well as the patient's underlying disease and age.\n- Intravenous Administration\n- The initial starting dose is 0.2 to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. Titrate the dose to achieve accepanalgesia and tolerable adverse events. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg.\n- Hepatic Impairment\n- Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment.\n- Renal Impairment\n- Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment.\n- Conversion From Prior Opioid\n- Use the equianalgesic dose below  as a guide to determine the appropriate dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF). Convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. For opioids not in , first estimate the daily amount of morphine that is equivalent to the current total daily amount of other opioid(s) received, then use  to find the approximate equivalent total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF).\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) (for use in opioid-tolerant patients only)\n- Do not use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) for patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant or sedating effects of opioids'.\n- Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer.\n- Use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) ONLY for patients who require the higher concentration and lower total volume of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF).\n- Because of its high concentration, the delivery of precise doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) may be difficult if low doses of hydromorphone are required. Therefore, use hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation.\n- Base the starting dose for hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) on the prior dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection or on the prior dose of an alternate opioid as described above in 4 Conversion From Prior Opioid.\n\n【8】 # Administration and Reconstitution\n- Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) ampules. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (HPF) are physically compatible and chemically sfor at least 24 hours at 25°C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions.\n500 mg/50 mL Vial\n- To use this single dose presentation, do not penetrate the stopper with a syringe. Instead, remove both the aluminum flipseal and rubber stopper in a suiwork area, such as under a laminar flow hood (or equivalent clean air compounding area). The contents may then be withdrawn for preparation of a single, large-volume parenteral solution. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner.\n\n【9】 # DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (high potency formulation) (for use in opioid-tolerant patients only): Each amber ampule and amber single-dose vial contains 10 mg/mL of hydromorphone hydrochloride in a sterile, aqueous solution and is available in 1 mL or 5 mL ampules or in 50 mL single-dose vials.\n\n【10】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【11】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Hydromorphone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【12】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Hydromorphone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【13】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【14】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Hydromorphone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【16】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Hydromorphone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Hydromorphone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【18】 # Contraindications\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection  is contraindicated:\n- In patients with known hypersensitivity to hydromorphone, hydromorphone salts, any other components of the product, or sulfite-containing medications.\n- In any situation where opioids are contraindicated, e.g., in patients with respiratory depression in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings; or patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma.\n- In patients with, or at risk of developing, gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus because hydromorphone diminishes the propulsive peristaltic wave in the gastrointestinal tract and may prolong the obstruction.\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection  is contraindicated in patients who are not opioid tolerant.\n\n【19】 # Warnings\n- Risk of Medication Errors\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) is a 10 mg/mL concentrated solution of hydromorphone, and is intended for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer.\n- Do not confuse Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with standard parenteral formulations of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL) or other opioids, as overdose and death could result.\n- Morphine does not convert to hydromorphone on a mg per mg basis. Use  when converting a patient from morphine to hydromorphone to avoid errors that can lead to overdose or death.\n- Respiratory Depression\n a particular problem following large initial doses in non opioid-tolerant patients or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.\n- Use Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with extreme caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of opioid analgesics may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider using non-opioid analgesics, and administer Hydromorphone HCl Injection only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients.\n- Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist with an abuse liability similar to morphine, and a Schedule II, controlled substance. Hydromorphone has the potential for being abused, is sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders, and is subject to criminal diversion. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to criminal penalty.\n- Abuse of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF), poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. Schedule II opioid agonists have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal respiratory depression.\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion.\n- Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority \n- Interactions with Alcohol and other CNS Depressants\n- The concurrent use of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including but not limited to, other opioids, illicit drugs, sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, muscle relaxants, other tranquilizers, and alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, potentially resulting in coma or death. Use with caution and in reduced dosages in patients taking CNS depressants.\n- Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome\n be physically dependent and may exhibit signs of withdrawal. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may be life threatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts .\n- Use in Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Injury\n- The respiratory depressant effects of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) promote carbon dioxide retention which results in elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This increase in intracranial pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other conditions that predispose patients to increased intracranial pressure.\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may produce effects on pupillary response and consciousness which can obscure the clinical course and neurologic signs of further increase in pressure in patients with head injuries.\n- Hypotensive Effect\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may cause severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure is compromised by a depleted blood volume, or a concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines, general anesthetics, or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone.\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.\n- Administer Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.\n- Sulfites\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.\n- Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease and Other Gastrointestinal Conditions\n- The administration of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.\n- Use Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with caution in patients who are at risk of developing ileus.\n- Use Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, as hydromorphone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions.\n- Special Risk Patients\n- Give Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with caution and the initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function; myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's Disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression.\n- The administration of opioid analgesics including Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may aggravate preexisting convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders.\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF), as with other opioids, may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.\n- Reports of mild to severe seizures and myoclonus have been reported in severely compromised patients, administered high doses of parenteral hydromorphone.\n- Use in Drug and Alcohol Dependent Patients\n- Use Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) with caution in patients with alcoholism and other drug dependencies due to the increased frequency of opioid tolerance, dependence, and the risk of addiction observed in these patient populations. Abuse of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) in combination with other CNS depressant drugs can result in serious risk to the patient.\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) contain hydromorphone, an opioid with no approved use in the management of addiction disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia.\n- Use in Ambulatory Patients\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating machinery). Patients should be cautioned accordingly. Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.\n- Parenteral Administration\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression.\n\n【20】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【21】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n- Serious adverse reactions associated with Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest.\n- The following serious adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling include:\n- Respiratory depression and secondary effects on intracranial pressure\n- Hypotension\n- Gastrointestinal effects and effects in sphincter of Oddi\n- Drug abuse, addiction, and dependence\n- Effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery\n- The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.\n- Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions\n- Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations\n- Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain\n- General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal, chills, injection site urticaria\n- Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic\n- Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite\n- Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity\n- Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope\n- Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams\n- Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects\n- Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm\n- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: injection site pain, urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis\n- Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension\n\n【22】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of hydromorphone. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: anaphylactic reactions, confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, injection site reactions, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence.\n\n【23】 # Drug Interactions\n- Drug Interactions with other CNS Depressants\n- Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result.\n- When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF), may enhance the action of neuromuscular blocking agents and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.\n- Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics\n- Agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist analgesics (buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF). In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.\n- Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)\n- MAOIs may potentiate the action of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF). Allow at least 14 days after stopping treatment with MAOIs before initiating treatment with Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF).\n- Anticholinergics\n- Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may result in increased risk of urinary retention and severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.\n\n【24】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【25】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Teratogenic Effects\n- Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Hydromorphone crosses the placenta. Hydromorphone HCl Injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- No effects on teratogenicity or embryotoxicity were observed in pregnant rats given oral doses up to 7 mg/kg/day which is 3-fold higher than the human dose of 24 mg Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) (4 mg every 4 hours), on a body surface area basis. Hydromorphone administration to pregnant Syrian hamsters and CF-1 mice during major organ development revealed teratogenic effects likely the result of maternal toxicity associated with sedation and hypoxia. In Syrian hamsters given single subcutaneous doses from 14 to 258 mg/kg during organogenesis (gestation days 8 to , doses ≥ 19 mg/kg of hydromorphone produced skull malformations (exencephaly and cranioschisis). In CF-1 mice, continuous infusion of hydromorphone (≥ 15 mg/kg over 24 hours) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (gestation days 7 to  produced soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites). The malformations and variations observed in the hamsters and mice were observed at doses approximately 6-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, than the human dose of 24 mg Hydromorphone HCl Injection (4 mg every 4 hours), on a body surface area basis.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Hydromorphone (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【26】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- Hydromorphone HCl should be used with caution during labor. Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and physiologic effects in neonates. Sinusoidal fetal heart rate patterns may occur with the use of opioid analgesics.\n- Occasionally, opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF), may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.\n- Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF), may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate.\n exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth or in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.\n- The effect of Hydromorphone HCl, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.\n\n【27】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) since it, and other drugs in this class, may be excreted in the milk.\n\n【28】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) in pediatric patients has not been established.\n\n【29】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in non-opioid-tolerant patients. Titration in these patients should proceed cautiously\n\n【30】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Hydromorphone (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【31】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Hydromorphone (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【32】 ### Renal Impairment\n- The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release ts) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-∞) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr  80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration\n\n【33】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release ts) are affected by hepatic impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC∞) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting do\n\n【34】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Hydromorphone (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【35】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Hydromorphone (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【36】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【37】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【38】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Hydromorphone (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【39】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Hydromorphone (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # Overdosage\n- Signs and Symptoms\n- Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage with Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) include: respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.\n- Hydromorphone may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.\n- Treatment\n- In the treatment of overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation.\n- The opioid antagonist, naloxone, is a specific antidote against respiratory depression which may result from overdosage, or unusual sensitivity to Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF). Therefore, an appropriate dose of this antagonist should be administered, preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Naloxone should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression. Naloxone should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected, to be physically dependent on Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF). In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome.\n- Since the duration of action of Hydromorphone HCl Injection (HPF) may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance; repeated doses of the antagonist may be required to maintain adequate respiration. Apply other supportive measures when indicated.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The precise mode of analgesic action of opioid analgesics is unknown. However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified. Opioids are believed to express their pharmacological effects by combining with these receptors.\n- Hydromorphone hydrochloride is a mu-opioid receptor agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone, and oxymorphone.\n- Central Nervous System\n- Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia.\n involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension.\n- Hydromorphone causes miosis. Pinpoint pupils are a common sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings).\n- Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle\n- Gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions are decreased by opioids such as hydromorphone. Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the gastric antrum and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, and tone may be increased to the point of spasm. The end result is constipation. Hydromorphone can cause a marked increase in biliary tract pressure as a result of spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.\n- Cardiovascular System\n- Hydromorphone may produce hypotension as a result of either peripheral vasodilation, release of histamine, or both. Other manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, and red eyes.\n- Effects on the myocardium after intravenous administration of opioids are not significant in normal persons, vary with different opioid analgesic agents and vary with the hemodynamic state of the patient, state of hydration and sympathetic drive.\n- Endocrine System\n- Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.\n- Immune System\n- In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, USP, a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, is an opioid analgesic. The chemical name of hydromorphone hydrochloride is 4,5∝-epoxy-3 hydroxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one hydrochloride. The structural formula is:\n- Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, USP  is available as a sterile, aqueous solution in AMBER ampules and in AMBER, single-dose vials for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration. Each ampule and single-dose vial contains 10 mg/mL of hydromorphone hydrochloride with 0.2% sodium citrate and 0.2% citric acid added as a buffer to maintain a pH of between 3.5 and 5.5. The single dose vials are capped with stoppers not containing natural rubber latex.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Hydromorphone (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Distribution\n- At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution  is 302.9 (32%) liters.\n- Metabolism\n- Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites.\n- Elimination\n- Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours.\n- Special Populations\n- Hepatic Impairment\n- After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release ts), mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC∞) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at onefourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose.\n- Renal Impairment\n- The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release ts) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-∞) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr  80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration.\n- Pediatrics\n- Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone have not been evaluated in children.\n- Geriatric\n- In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone.\n- Gender\n- Gender has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher Cmax (25%) than males with comparable AUC0-24 values. The difference observed in Cmax may not be clinically relevant.\n- Race\n- The effect of race on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics has not been studied.\n- Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers\n found in low levels in breast milk, and may cause respiratory compromise in newborns when administered during labor or delivery.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenesis\n- Long term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydromorphone have not been conducted.\n- Mutagenesis\n- Hydromorphone was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay). Hydromorphone was not clastogenic in either the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- No effects on fertility, reproductive performance, or reproductive organ morphology were observed in male or female rats given oral doses up to 7 mg/kg/day which is 3-fold higher than the human dose of 24 mg hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (4 mg every 4 hours), on a body surface area basis.\n\n【47】 # Clinical Studies\n- Analgesic effects of single doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Liquid administered to patients with post-surgical pain have been studied in double-blind controlled trials. In one study, both 5 mg and 10 mg of hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Liquid provided significantly more analgesia than placebo.\n\n【48】 # How Supplied\n- Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, USP (High Potency Formulation) is available in AMBER ampules, and AMBER single dose vials. Each 1 mL of sterile solution contains 10 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride with 0.2% sodium citrate and 0.2% citric acid.

A greater proportion of older adults are protected by vaccination only and have not been infected, as compared to younger ages. Adolescents and young adults have the highest proportion of hybrid immunity.\n\n【3】 # Summary of evidence on bivalent Omicron-containing vaccines for primary series\n\n【4】 ## Primary series of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 in children 6 months to 5 years of age\n- The safety and immunogenicity of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 (25 mcg) as a primary series was evaluated in a Phase 3 open-label study in 179 unvaccinated children 6 months to 5 years of age. The vaccine contains equal parts (12.5 mcg each) of mRNA encoding for the spike protein of original SARS-CoV-2 and that of the Omicron BA.1 variant. Study participants were vaccinated with 2 doses 28 days apart. Neutralizing antibody responses and reactogenicity were compared to 6 month- to 5-year-old participants who had received a Moderna Spikevax original (25 mcg) primary series in an earlier study. Due to the different time frames for vaccination with each product, a substantially higher proportion of participants who received Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 had serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to participants who received Moderna Spikevax original (63% vs. 8%).\n- In all participants and the subset without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, neutralizing antibody responses against BA.1 28 days after dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 were superior compared to those after dose 2 in participants who received Moderna Spikevax original (geometric mean ratio  of titres were 25.4  in all participants and 15.8  in the subgroup without prior infection). In all participants, neutralizing antibody responses against original SARS-CoV-2 were non-inferior after dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 compared to dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax original (GMR 0 In the subgroup of participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, neutralizing antibody responses against original SARS-CoV-2 did not meet non-inferiority criteria compared to responses after dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax original (GMR 0\n- Local and systemic reactogenicity after dose 1 and dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 (25 mcg) were similar compared to those after dose 1 and dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax original (25 mcg). In an analysis conducted for Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 recipients only, the frequency of fever was higher after dose 1 for those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (12% vs. 2%). There were no reports of vaccine-related serious adverse events, myocarditis and/or pericarditis or deaths. Given the number of participants enrolled in the trial, it is unlikely that uncommon, rare or very rare adverse events would be detected. NACI will continue to monitor post-market safety surveillance data as it emerges.\n\n【5】 # Effectivenessandsafetyofbivalent Omicron-containingmRNAvaccines\n- While there is currently no clinical evidence on the safety, immunogenicity or efficacy of a primary series with bivalent BA.1-containing vaccines in individuals 6 years of age and older, and no data on the use of a primary series with bivalent BA.4/5 vaccines from either manufacturer in any age group, there is evidence on the safety and protection of bivalent BA.1 and BA.4/5 vaccines when used as a booster dose in individuals 5 years of age and older that has been described in NACI's . Briefly:\n\n【6】 ## Vaccine effectiveness\n- Real-world effectiveness data from the United States (US) and Europe suggest that in children and adults, a booster dose of a bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine provides increased protection against infection, symptomatic disease and severe outcomes, compared to those who only received doses of original monovalent mRNA vaccines in the past        . In some of the studies from the US, the relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the bivalent booster increased with increased time since the original vaccine group received their last dose, due to increased waning over time in this group. From most of these observational studies, it cannot be determined if the benefit is due to the recent receipt of a booster dose and/or specifically the receipt of a bivalent booster. For a more detailed description of some of these studies, please see NACI's .\n- Preliminary data from Ontario demonstrate that short-term (<90 to 119 days) VE against severe outcomes in community dwelling adults 50 years of age and older was similar between those receiving original and bivalent mRNA vaccine booster doses and between the available vaccine products (Moderna Spikevax original or bivalent BA.1 and Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty original or bivalent BA.4/ during a period when BA.5 was the predominant Omicron sub-lineage and BQ.1 was emerging.\n- In studies where bivalent Omicron-containing booster recipients were compared to those who received an original booster dose in the same time period, the protection of a bivalent booster against symptomatic disease was similar to or slightly higher than that offered by original boosters against symptomatic disease.\n\t+ A randomized clinical trial conducted by Moderna in the United Kingdom compared those 16 years of age and older randomized to receive a bivalent BA.1 booster to those randomized to receive an original monovalent booster. Although the primary endpoint was immunogenicity, exploratory analyses revealed that the efficacy against symptomatic disease was somewhat higher for the bivalent booster than the original booster against sub-lineages BA.2 (relative VE of bivalent booster compared to original booster vaccine of 32.6%; 95% CI: -15.1 to 60.5%) and BA.4 (41.6%; 95% CI: -5.1 to 67.5%), but not against BA.5 (4.4%; 95% CI: -27.2 to 28.2%).\n\t+ A retrospective, observational study in France matched and compared those 60 years of age and older who had received a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 with those who received a booster dose with an original COVID-19 vaccine (mostly Pfizer-BioNTech original) in the same time period. At a median of 77 days of follow-up, the bivalent booster offered minimal advantage over an original booster for protection against symptomatic disease (relative VE of bivalent booster compared to original booster of 8%; 95% CI: 0 to 16%). A sub-group analysis in participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no significant difference between bivalent and original boosters (VE calculated using adjusted hazard ratio for infection was 4%; 95% CI: -6 to 12%).\n- Preliminary data comparing bivalent BA.1 and BA.4/5 boosters are available from four Scandinavian countries using linked administrative data to evaluate the VE of original, bivalent BA.1 and bivalent BA.4/5 boosters. Bivalent BA.4/5 and BA.1 boosters (manufacturer not specified) were administered during the same time period and the bivalent BA.4/5 vaccine was associated with a somewhat lower relative risk of hospitalization compared to the bivalent BA.1 vaccine. However, this observation was based primarily on the comparative VE from Denmark. The VE estimate was not significant for Norway, and not estimable in the other two countries.\n\n【7】 ## Safety\n- Available evidence from Canada and internationally show that overall, the safety profile of the bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters is comparable to that of original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters among individuals 5 years of age and older      .\n- The safety profile appears to be similar in those with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n- Post-market surveillance data from Canada and the US indicates that the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (primary series or first booster) in children 5 to 11 years (who were predominantly vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty original   .\n- A possible association between Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 booster and ischemic stroke in persons 65 years of age and older was identified by the US Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) in January 2023 . This potential safety signal has not been identified with the Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and has not been replicated in other surveillance systems used to monitor vaccine safety in the US or in other countries. To date, the totality of the US data suggests that it is very unlikely that the potential signal in VSD represents a true clinical risk  . This is supported by international data including from Canada, Israel, Europe, and Singapore where a similar signal has not been identified. Monitoring of the potential safety signal is ongoing. NACI will update its recommendations as needed.\n\n【8】 # Ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability (EEFA)\n- NACI evaluated the following ethical considerations when making its recommendations: promoting well-being and minimizing risk of harm, maintaining trust, respect for persons and fostering autonomy, and promoting justice and equity. NACI considered the available evidence on bivalent, Omicron-containing mRNA vaccines used for primary series and accumulating real-world evidence on effectiveness and safety of bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccine booster doses.\n- It will not be feasible to continue using original monovalent mRNA vaccines for the primary series in Canada, as the supply of most original formulations is not expected to be available beyond summer 2023.\n- Streamlining of products recommended for primary series and booster doses simplifies the storage and handling required for vaccination programs and reduces the risk of vaccine administration errors.\n- Primary series recommendations are particularly important for infants who age into vaccine eligibility at 6 months and are less likely to be previously infected than older children and adults, and for young children for whom vaccine uptake has been low compared to individuals 12 years of age and older.\n- Given the current prevalence of Omicron sub-lineages and preferential recommendation for bivalent Omicron-containing vaccines for booster doses, those who may be hesitant to receive an original monovalent mRNA vaccine for a primary series now have another option recommended by NACI.\n- Despite the limited evidence on the use of bivalent vaccines as a primary series, the precautionary principle indicates that scientific uncertainty should not prevent decision makers from taking action to reduce risks associated with COVID-19.\n be included as part of the informed consent process.\n- COVID-19 vaccines have evolved over the pandemic and will continue to change as science and research progresses. Recommendations will evolve as well to ensure equiaccess to products that can be used for primary series for those who are unvaccinated.\n- Recommendations\n- NACI continues to recommend that unvaccinated individuals receive a primary series of COVID-19 vaccines as recommended in the  of the Canadian Immunization Guide and current NACI . Regarding the product offered,\n1. NACI recommends that when mRNA vaccines are used for the primary series, bivalent Omicron-containing vaccines can be used, as outlined in .\n\t- Consistent with current NACI recommendations on vaccine interchangeability, regardless of which product is offered to start a primary series, the previous dose should be counted; the series should be continued and not restarted. If a primary series is started with an original mRNA vaccine, a bivalent Omicron-containing vaccine can be used to complete the series. If a primary series is started with a bivalent Omicron containing mRNA vaccine and the same product is not readily available to complete the series, another bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccine may be used to complete the series. \n\t- The current recommendation for the primary series is for the bivalent vaccine products authorized to date, as these are the products currently available for use in Canada . If there are changes to the authorized schedules and/or dosages or if new formulations of COVID-19 vaccines become available for the fall 2023 vaccination program, these interim recommendations will be reviewed and updated as appropriate.\n\t- Please see the  of the Canadian Immunization Guide and  \n\n【9】 # Additional considerations and rationale\n- Moderna Spikevax bivalent 25 mcg (0.25 mL)\n- Moderna Spikevax bivalent 50 mcg (0.5 mL)\n- Products referred to include Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5, and Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5.\n- There is no bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech product available in Canada to provide an appropriate dosage (3 mcg) for children 6 months to 4 years of age.\n- Individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may benefit more from a primary series with Moderna Spikevax bivalent (50 mcg in ≥12 years of age and 25 mcg in 6 months to 11 years of age) compared to Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 (30 mcg in ≥12 years of age and 10 mcg in 5 to 11 years of age).\n- Omicron and its sub-lineages are antigenically distinct from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. Recent and currently dominant strains circulating in Canada are some of the most antigenically distinct sub-lineages observed to date . Exposure to diverse antigens through vaccination and subsequent expansion of the immune repertoire against COVID-19 is expected to be beneficial in the long term, especially for unvaccinated individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., infection naïve young children who have not been vaccinated or infection naïve infants who are newly eligible for vaccination). Use of bivalent vaccines for the primary series primes naïve individuals with both Omicron and original SARS-CoV-2, which will help to maximize the breadth of immunity at the earliest opportunity.\n- The safety profile of bivalent Omicron-containing vaccines as boosters has been observed to be similar to that of original mRNA vaccine boosters.\n- Available evidence on the effectiveness of bivalent vaccines as boosters suggest they provide protection that is similar to, or somewhat better than that with original mRNA vaccines as boosters, particularly with regard to preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic disease. The limited available evidence assessing the immunogenicity of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 and original vaccines as a primary series in children 6 months to 5 years of age indicate a better immune response of the bivalent vaccine against the Omicron subvariant BA.1.\n protection against divergent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens.\n\n【10】 ## Rationale for the recommended bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccines and dosages for the primary series (as described in ):\n- Seroprevalence due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada is high in adults (although somewhat lower in older adults), adolescents and school-aged children, but relatively lower in young children and infants who may not yet have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. As such, the dosage of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5 currently authorized for use as a booster dose (i.e., 50 mcg for adults and adolescents, 25 mcg for children 6 to 11 years of age) is expected to be sufficient for primary series doses with Moderna Spikevax bivalent vaccines for children 6 years of age and older, as well as adolescents and adults. The standard dose for Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent vaccines, according to age, is recommended for use in the primary series.\n- Individuals with a decreased response to vaccination, such as those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, may benefit from a primary series with Moderna Spikevax bivalent using the dosages outlined above (50 mcg in individuals 12 years of age and older, and 25 mcg in children 6 months to 11 years of age) compared to Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 (30 mcg in individuals 12 years of age and older, and 10 mcg in children 5 to 11 years of age). For the original COVID-19 vaccines, NACI preferentially recommended the use of Moderna Spikevax original (25 mcg) for moderately to severely immunocompromised children 6 months to 4 years of age, as this product required one fewer dose than the Pfizer-BioNTech original (3 mcg) product and may therefore be more accepand feasible for this group.\n- For individuals 12 to 29 years of age, Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 is preferred to Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5 due to a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis observed after dose 1 and dose 2 of the primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty original (30 mcg) compared to Moderna Spikevax original (100 mcg) in this age group. For some moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals 12 to 29 years of age, administration of Moderna Spikevax bivalent (50 mcg) may be considered based on clinical judgement.\n- NACI previously recommended the preferential use of Pfizer-BioNTech original (10 mcg) over Moderna Spikevax original (25 mcg or 50 mcg) in children 5 to 11 years of age based on the precautionary principle and limited data on the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination that was available at the time for this age group. However, the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a primary series dose of an original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in this age group is now known to be substantially lower compared to the risk following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in individuals 12 to 29 years of age (in whom the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis is the highest) and individuals 30 to 49 years of age (in whom there is no preference between Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty original or Moderna Spikevax original for the primary series). Based on this, there is no preferred product between Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 (10 mcg) and Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5 (25 mcg) for the primary series in children 5 to 11 years of age. It should be noted that the low rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis with the primary series in children 5 to 11 years of age have been in the context of the predominant use of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty original (10 mcg) in this age group.\n- For children 6 months to 4 years of age, Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5 (25 mcg) is recommended for the primary series as:\n\t+ It is not feasible to administer Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 (3 mcg) with the products that are currently available in Canada.\n\t+ There is a greater likelihood that children in this age group are immunologically naïve compared to older children. Thus, the same dose used for the primary series with Moderna Spikevax original is recommended for the primary series with Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 or BA.4/5.\n- None of the authorized bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in Canada are currently indicated for use as a primary series by Health Canada; they are currently authorized for booster doses. Regulatory review has been initiated for some products, but at this time all recommendations for use of bivalent mRNA vaccines for the primary series are considered off-label. NACI encourages manufacturers to submit modifications to current COVID-19 vaccine authorizations to the Canadian regulator in a timely manner.\n- Additional details on primary series vaccination for COVID-19 and bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccines are available in the  in the Canadian Immunization Guide and NACI .\n- NACI continues to monitor and assess the evidence as it emerges and will update its recommendations as needed.\n- Research priorities\n consider the clinical implications of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; repeated immunization; and the impacts of vaccination on outcomes after any infection such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), post-COVID-19 condition/post-acute COVID syndrome (long COVID), or infection-induced myocarditis and/or pericarditis in older and younger adult, adolescent, and pediatric populations.\n2. Ongoing monitoring of research related to any proposed change in the formulation for both the primary series and the booster doses.\n3. Vigilant monitoring and reporting of adverse events of special interest to support the rapid identification of potential vaccine safety signals and accurately inform potential risks associated with any future primary series or booster doses. Global collaboration should be prioritized to enable data sharing so decision makers around the world can weigh benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n4. Continuous monitoring of COVID-19 epidemiology and vaccine effectiveness in special populations at high risk of severe outcomes or long-term consequences of infection with COVID-19, including but not limited to those with co-morbidities (including immunocompromising conditions) and pregnant populations.\n5. Continuous monitoring of vaccine coverage in Canada, for COVID-19 vaccines and other routine vaccines, particularly in the context of COVID-19 vaccines for the primary series (particularly for children) and booster doses and including consideration of measures that may reduce the risk of disparities in vaccine confidence and uptake across different sub-populations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#0#0#Recommendations\n无关文本#6#6#For a more detailed description of some of these studies, please see NACI’s .\n无关文本#8#8#Please see the of the Canadian Immunization Guide and", "type4": "语义不完整#1#1#is summarized below.没说完\n语义不完整#5#5# Briefly:没说完", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 19:33:40"}

A second publication covers the provision of home safety equipment and home risk assessments and a third covers unintentional injuries on the road.\n- The Department of Health (DH) asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to produce public health guidance on the prevention of unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15. This guidance focuses on strategies, regulation, enforcement, surveillance and workforce development in relation to preventing unintentional injuries in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure.\n- The guidance is for commissioners and providers of health services, local authority children's services, local authorities and their strategic partnerships, local highway authorities, local safeguarding children boards, police, fire and rescue services, policy makers, professional bodies, providers of play and leisure facilities, and schools.\n for other public, private, voluntary and community organisations and services which have a direct or indirect role in preventing unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15.\n be of interest to children, young people, parents, carers and other members of the public.\n\n【3】 - The Programme Development Group (PDG) developed these recommendations on the basis of reviews of the evidence, economic modelling, expert testimony, stakeholder comments and fieldwork.\n- Members of the PDG are listed in appendix A. The methods used to develop the guidance are summarised in appendix B.\n- Supporting documents used to prepare this document are listed in appendix E.\n- Full details of the evidence collated, including fieldwork data and stakeholder comments, are available on the NICE website, along with a list of the stakeholders involved and NICE's supporting process and methods manuals.# Recommendations\n- This is NICE's formal guidance on strategies to prevent unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15. When writing the recommendations, the Programme Development Group (PDG)  considered the evidence of effectiveness (including cost effectiveness), expert testimony, fieldwork data and comments from stakeholders. Full details are available online.\n- The evidence statements underpinning the recommendations are listed in appendix C.\n- The evidence reviews, supporting evidence statements and economic analysis are available online.\n- Please note: the absence of recommendations on any particular measures to prevent unintentional injuries is a result of a lack of evidence that met the inclusion criteria for the evidence reviews. It should not be taken as a judgement on whether or not any such measures are effective and cost effective.\n\n【4】 # Definitions\n- The guidance uses the term 'unintentional injuries' rather than 'accidents' as: \"most injuries and their precipitating events are predicand preven\". The term 'accident' implies an unpredicand therefore unavoidable event.\n- The term 'vulnerable' is used to  children and young people who are at greater than average risk of an unintentional injury due to one or more factors. As an example, they may be more vulnerable if they:\n- are under the age of 5 years (generally, under-5s are more vulnerable to unintentional injuries in the home)\n- are over the age of 11 (generally, over-11s are more vulnerable to unintentional injuries on the road)\n- have a disability or impairment (physical or learning)\n- are from some minority ethnic groups\n- live with a family on a low income\n- live in accommodation which potentially puts them more at risk (this could include multiple-occupied housing and social and privately rented housing).\n\n【5】 # Topics\n- The recommendations are divided into six categories: general, workforce training and capacity building, injury surveillance, home safety, outdoor play and leisure, and road safety.\n\n【6】 # National recommendations\n- The guidance includes some national recommendations to assist local action .\n- The decision on whether these recommendations are taken forward – and how they are prioritised – will be determined by government and subject to statutory regulatory and cost impact assessments.\n\n【7】 # General recommendations\n\n【8】 ## Context\n- The prevention of unintentional injuries among children and young people may not be a priority among local organisations. To ensure prevention activities are accorded the importance they deserve, they need to be incorporated into national objectives aiming to improve the population's health. Local injury prevention coordinators could promote a strategic framework for action and encourage local agencies to work together.\n benefit the wider population).\n\n【9】 ## Recommendation 1 Incorporating unintentional injury prevention within local and national plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships, in consultation with local safeguarding children boards.\n- Government departments with a responsibility for preparing policy and plans relating to children and young people's health and wellbeing.\n- Ensure local and national plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing include a commitment to preventing unintentional injuries among them. In particular, the plans and strategies should aim to prevent unintentional injuries among the most vulnerable groups to reduce inequalities in health. This commitment should be part of a wider objective to keep children and young people safe.\n- Ensure plans and strategies include the following to prevent unintentional injuries among children and young people:\n- support for cross-departmental and cross-agency working to achieve national and local commitments\n- support for local partnerships, including those with the voluntary sector, and a requirement that they work together to ensure children and young people can lead healthy, active lives\n- information about how partners will collaborate on injury prevention\n- support for data collection on the incidence, severity, type, cause and place of injury (for example, see recommendations 7–8 on injury surveillance)\n- support for monitoring the outcomes of injury prevention initiatives\n- support for the development of workforce capacity in this area, including the provision of suitably trained staff and opportunities for initial and ongoing multi-agency training and development .\n- Local authorities should report to the local strategic partnership on progress made to meet the commitments set out in the plans and strategies. This should include details on the experiences of children, young people, their parents and carers.\n\n【10】 ## Recommendation 2 Coordinating unintentional injury prevention activities\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships, in consultation with local safeguarding children boards.\n- Local highway authorities and their road safety partnerships.\n- Other local authority services that may have a remit for preventing unintentional injuries such as education, environmental health and trading standards.\n- Ensure there is a child and young person injury prevention coordinator.  The aim is to help achieve the commitments set out in local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing. The coordinator could be someone in the local authority, an NHS organisation or another local partner organisation (such as the fire and rescue service or a housing association). Alternatively, the coordinating role could be jointly funded by several local partners.\n- Ensure the coordinator:\n- works with local partnerships that include organisations involved with children, young people, their parents and carers\n- develops a 2 to 3-year injury prevention strategy with these partners which is integrated into all relevant local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing\n- networks at regional and national level with other child and young person injury prevention coordinators\n includes acting as a local source of information and advice on prevention\n- monitors progress made on the injury prevention commitments set out in local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing. They should report progress to the director of children's services.\n- Ensure the coordinator understands the range of preventive measures available and is trained – and has the skills – to carry out the above activities. Provide them with both informal and formal learning opportunities. (The former could include using peer support and 'cascade learning' within placements. The latter could include the acquisition of qualifications at different stages of a formal career pathway.)\n- Ensure specialist learning and training is monitored and evaluated to see what effect it has on the coordinator's performance. Revise approaches that are found to be ineffective.\n\n【11】 ## Recommendation 3 Identifying and responding to attendances at emergency departments and minor injuries units\n- Staff in emergency departments and minor injuries units, including triage nurses.\n- Local child and young person injury prevention coordinators.\n- Local safeguarding children boards.\n- Liaison health visitors.\n- Staff offering out-of-hours health services for children and young people (for example, in walk-in centres).\n- Ensure health visitors, school nurses and GPs are aware of families which might benefit from injury prevention advice and a home safety assessment. Do this by using local protocols to alert them when a child or young person repeatedly needs treatment for unintentional injuries at an emergency department or minor injuries unit. Do the same when a single attendance raises concerns.\n\n【12】 # Recommendations for workforce training and capacity building\n\n【13】 ## Context\n required.\n benefit the wider population).\n\n【14】 ## Recommendation 4 Developing professional standards for injury prevention\n- Faculty of Public Health.\n- Royal colleges and professional bodies (for example, the Nursing and Midwifery Council).\n- Health and Care Professions Council.\n- Sector skills councils.\n- Relevant voluntary sector organisations.\n- Universities.\n take practitioners' views into account.\n- Ensure all relevant organisations incorporate these standards into their professional skills development programmes.\n\n【15】 ## Recommendation 5 Funding the development of injury prevention standards and curricula\n- Department of Health and Social Care.\n- Department for Education.\n- Encourage funding for educational establishments and organisations to help them develop standards for competencies in – and courses and modules on – the prevention of unintentional injuries among children and young people. The establishments and organisations involved could include: the Faculty of Public Health, the Children's Workforce Development Council, universities, royal colleges and organisations in the voluntary sector.\n\n【16】 ## Recommendation 6 Providing the wider childcare workforce with access to injury prevention training\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships, including local safeguarding children boards.\n- Local injury prevention coordinators.\n- Commissioners, managers and practitioners working in health, social care and education services.\n- Relevant organisations in the voluntary and private sector.\n- Provide access to appropriate education and training in how to prevent unintentional injuries for everyone who works with (or cares for and supports) children, young people and their families. Prioritise those who work directly with children, young people and their families.\n- Ensure the education and training:\n- supports the wider child health remit (for example, the promotion of children and young people's development)\n- helps develop an understanding of the importance of preventing unintentional injuries and their consequences and the preventive measures available.\n- Ensure specialist education and training is monitored and evaluated to see what effect it has on practitioner performance. Revise approaches that are found to be ineffective.\n\n【17】 # Recommendations for injury surveillance\n\n【18】 ## Context\n- Injury 'surveillance' is needed to monitor unintentional injuries among children and young people locally, regionally and nationwide. The data gathered could be used as the basis to plan preventive initiatives. Such initiatives may need to take a particular type of injury into account locally or regionally – even though it may not be a major problem nationwide.\n benefit the wider population).\n\n【19】 ## Recommendation 7 Establishing a national injuries surveillance resource\n- College of Emergency Medicine.\n- Government departments including Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England, Department for Education, Department for Transport, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Home Office.\n- Office for National Statistics.\n- The Information Centre for Health and Social Care.\n- Establish a national injuries surveillance resource covering all populations and injuries to help monitor injury risks and the effects of preventive measures. It could be provided by a network of agencies but there should be a single point of contact or a coordinating agency. The resource could be part of the proposed 'Information revolution'.\n- Ensure the resource includes local, regional and national injury datasets and data sources. For example, it should include data gathered from: emergency departments, walk-in centres, minor injury units, Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), coroner reports, ambulance call-out reports, fire and rescue service reports, reported road casualty statistics (STATS and the child death review process (as data become available).\n- The coordinating agency or network of agencies should:\n- ensure datasets can be integrated to provide accurate, anonymised and aggregated statistics on local injuries and their causes\n- collate, manage, analyse and interpret injury-related data (using experienced injury researchers to advise on analysis and interpretation)\n- provide a secure and reliable information system for recording and interrogating data (compliant with the Data Protection Act \n- monitor the quality of data submissions and datasets\n- report relevant findings to support the monitoring of emergency department service contracts\n- provide government departments with advice on developing standardised injury data collection and coding across datasets (for example, for data collected by fire and rescue services and emergency departments)\n- identify and develop new data sources for example, data collected by non-governmental agencies and the voluntary sector\n- disseminate information locally and regionally and provide a readily available, searchable database for authorised users\n- support the European Commission's work on injury surveillance.\n- Ensure national guidance on data-sharing protocols is adopted by all agencies that collect local injury data. This includes: ambulance services, child death overview panels, coroners, emergency departments, fire and rescue services, the Health and Safety Executive and police forces.\n- Promote the development of an enhanced national emergency department dataset based on submissions from a representative sample of hospitals. Ensure it includes additional data on events and activities leading to an injury.\n\n【20】 ## Recommendation 8 Gathering high quality injury data from emergency departments\n- Commissioners of health services.\n- Ensure all hospital trusts are made aware of the data collection requirements for the universal and mandatory A&E (minimum) commissioning dataset.\n stipulate which data collection and submission methods should be used.\n- Ensure contracts include financial penalties for failure to meet the requirements of the A&E (minimum) commissioning dataset.\n- Ensure all hospital trust injury data are submitted to the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.\n\n【21】 # Recommendations for home safety\n\n【22】 ## Definitions and context\n- \n- Permanent home safety equipment is defined here as any device that needs to be fitted and cannot easily be modified or removed by the householder. Examples include smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, thermostatic mixing valves and window restrictors.\n- Ensuring permanent safety equipment is fitted in homes and the provision of home safety assessments should help prevent unintentional injuries among all under-15s. However, groups facing a higher than average risk of an unintentional injury need to be prioritised. Particularly vulnerable groups in relation to home safety are children aged under 5 and those living in temporary, rented and social housing with families on a low income (for other vulnerable groups see definitions at the beginning of section .\n\n【23】  benefit the wider population).\n\n【24】 ## Recommendation 9 Installation and maintenance of permanent safety equipment in social and rented dwellings\n- Local authorities.\n- Consider developing local agreements with housing associations and landlords to ensure permanent home safety equipment is installed and maintained in all social and rented dwellings. Priority should be given to accommodation where children aged under 5 are living. Use the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). Permanent safety equipment includes:\n- thermostatic mixer valves for baths\n- window restrictors.For duties about installing and maintaining smoke and carbon monoxide alarms,  the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015.\n- Publicise any local agreements to install and maintain permanent safety equipment. Provide information about these agreements to the following groups and evaluate their awareness:\n- those responsible for social and rented dwellings, such as landlords and social housing providers\n- practitioners with an injury prevention remit or who have an opportunity to help prevent injuries among children and young people\n- practitioners with a role in assessing health and safety in residential properties\n- residents in rented and social dwellings.\n\n【25】 ## Recommendation 10 Incorporating guidance on home safety assessments within relevant national initiatives\n- Department of Health.\n- Department for Education.\n- Ensure national initiatives to improve child health include guidance on delivering home safety assessments and providing safety education to families with a child under 5 or with other children who may be particularly vulnerable to unintentional injuries. (Relevant national initiatives include the Healthy Child Programme.)\n\n【26】 ## Recommendation 11 Incorporating home safety assessments and equipment provision within local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships, in consultation with local safeguarding children boards.\n- Ensure home safety assessments and education are incorporated in local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing. They should be aimed at families with a child under 5 or with other children who may be particularly vulnerable to unintentional injuries.\n- Commission local agencies to offer home safety assessments and, where appropriate, supply and install sui, high quality home safety equipment (whenever possible, adhering to British or equivalent European standards.)\n need to be noted. In addition, the level of control people have over their home environment and the household's perception of, and degree of trust in, authority should be taken into account.\n- Ensure commissions specify that the assessment needs to help parents, carers, older children and young people identify and address the potential risks from water in the home (this includes baths and garden ponds.\n explain why safety equipment has been installed – and the danger of disabling it. In addition, commissions should specify that useful links and contacts need to be given to householders as part of this provision, in case of a home safety problem.\n\n【27】 # Recommendations for outdoor play and leisure\n\n【28】 ## Context\n- Children and young people learn, develop and mature when playing and taking part in activities that challenge them. Their participation in regular physical activity and outdoor play and leisure is important for their growth, development and general health and wellbeing – in both the short and long term. (For example, it can help reduce the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.)\n differ. For example, where children and young people go off-road cycling will vary, depending on their age and experience: younger children are most likely to cycle in gardens and parks, while older children and young people may get involved in activities such as BMX racing or mountain biking.\n- These recommendations cover preventive activities at the strategic level (for example, the need to monitor compliance with safety standards). This does not imply that they are the only actions that could be taken to prevent unintentional injuries outdoors and during play and leisure.\n benefit the wider population).\n\n【29】 ## Recommendation 12 Developing policies for public outdoor play and leisure\n- Head teachers and school governors.\n- Local strategic partnerships.\n includes private providers of outdoor play facilities that are open to the public, such as pubs and hotels.\n- Public, private, voluntary and community sector managers and decision makers responsible for play and leisure policies.\n- Ensure a policy is in place which:\n- takes a balanced approach to assessing the risks and benefits of play and leisure environments and activities \n- counters excessive risk aversion\n- promotes the need for children and young people to develop skills to assess and manage risks, according to their age and ability\n- takes into account children and young people's preferences about the types of outdoor play and leisure activities they want to participate in\n- is inclusive, taking into account the needs of all children and young people, including those from lower socioeconomic groups, those from minority ethnic groups with specific cultural requirements and those who have a disability.\n- Use local in\n- Focus prevention initiatives on groups most at risk of an unintentional injury. Initiatives could include modification of equipment and the environment, and the provision of information, education and safety equipment.\n- Take into account the principles of British and European standards covering equipment and the environment (where they exist) as part of a risk-benefit assessment of outdoor play and leisure environments. This includes standards covering playgrounds, fairgrounds, toy safety and swimming pools, as well as those for inspection and maintenance.\n- Where equipment and the environment cannot be modified, provide information, advice and education about risk management and the use of any appropriate safety equipment.\n\n【30】 ## Recommendation 13 Providing education and advice on water safety\n- Injury prevention coordinators and health practitioners (for example, health visitors and school nurses).\n- Lifeguards.\n- Outdoor activity and holiday centre managers.\n- Schools.\n- Swimming instructors.\n- Swimming pool managers.\n- Know which groups of children and young people are at high risk of drowning – and when that risk is increased. For example, children with certain medical conditions may be more at risk and boys are more likely to be at risk than girls. In addition, older children are more likely to drown outside the home.\n be factually correct and consistent.\n- Ensure the information and education:\n- helps parents, carers, older children and young people identify and address the potential risks from water in the wider environment (this includes lakes, canals, rivers and on the coast)\n- stresses the importance of proper supervision, particularly for younger children, and describes in detail what this means.\n- Provide timely in\n- Encourage children, young people, their parents and carers to become competent swimmers and to learn other water safety skills (for example, so that they know how to effect a rescue).\n raise children and young people's awareness of how difficult it is to assess and manage the hazards posed by water in a range of different outdoor environments.\n\n【31】 ## Recommendation 14 Water safety advice for leisure providers\n- Leisure facility providers such as leisure centre and pool operators, boat hire companies, hoteliers, holiday companies and tour operators.\n- Use risk analysis and management procedures to identify where there may be a risk of drowning. Minimise that risk, wherever possible, without discouraging swimming.\n- Provide water safety in\n\n【32】 ## Recommendation 15 Advising on off-road cycle safety\n- NHS and other health organisations.\n- Local authorities.\n- Schools and school travel advisers.\n- Injury prevention coordinators.\n- Police.\n- Retail outlets and cycle hire centres.\n- NHS, other health organisations and local authorities should use local information campaigns and ongoing education to encourage cycle training and promote the use of correctly fitted and fastened cycle helmets while cycling off the road. Campaigns could focus on younger children learning to cycle, for example in gardens and parks, and on older children and young people who go BMX racing or mountain biking. The campaigns could suggest that adults set an example by wearing helmets whenever they cycle.\n encourage children and young people to undertake cycle training and to wear cycle helmets.\n consider setting up a certified retailer scheme like that run by the British Equestrian Trade Association.\n- Cycle hire centres should advise about the advantages of children and young people wearing correctly fitted and fastened cycle helmets. They should provide them if requested.\n\n【33】 ## Recommendation 16 Conducting local firework safety campaigns\n- Environmental health officers.\n- Fire service.\n- Clinical commissioning groups and hospital trusts.\n- Injury prevention coordinators.\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships.\n- Police.\n- Schools.\n- Trading standards officers.\n- Use emergency department surveillance data to inform local firework injury prevention campaigns.\n- Conduct local firework injury prevention campaigns during the lead up to all celebrations and festivals where fireworks are used. This includes Bonfire Night, New Year and Diwali. Use the principles of behaviour change to inform campaign planning, delivery and evaluation. Evaluate the effectiveness of campaigns.\n- Trading standards officers should ensure adults are given the firework safety code when they buy fireworks, as a condition of the licence to store and sell fireworks. The code should be available in a range of languages and formats.\n\n【34】 # Recommendations for road safety\n\n【35】 ## Context\n- These recommendations propose that those responsible for road safety should focus on the needs of local children and young people. This includes helping drivers to reduce their speed in areas where children and young people are present. They should be read in conjunction with recommendations made in NICE's guideline on unintentional injuries on the road: interventions for under 15s.\n benefit the wider population).\n\n【36】 ## Recommendation 17 Maintaining and managing road safety partnerships\n- Local highway authorities.\n- Maintain the existing road safety partnership (or establish one where none exists) to help plan, coordinate and manage road safety activities. It should include the road safety team, fire and rescue services, the injury prevention coordinator, the NHS, police, local education authorities and local safeguarding children boards.\n- Ensure the health sector plays an active role in the partnership .\n- Nominate a member of staff who is responsible for road safety partnership work.\n- Work with the partners listed in the first action point above, children and young people's services, relevant voluntary sector organisations and others to identify and manage road environments that pose a high risk to children and young people.\n- Secure funding streams for local road safety initiatives and support these partnerships by promoting good practice.\n involves gaining local information from other professional partnerships, children's councils and neighbourhood forums.\n reflect the increased risks facing children and young people from disadvantaged areas and communities.\n- Evaluate programmes using a range of outcome measures, including road injury data. A variety of evaluation methods should be used, such as controlled trials, 'stepped-wedge' trials (sequential rollout to all participants) and process evaluations.\n\n【37】 ## Recommendation 18 Carrying out local child road safety reviews and consultations\n- Local highway authorities and their road safety partnerships .\n- Ensure local child road safety reviews are carried out at least every 3 years. To ensure consistency within regions, ensure they include the following:\n- all road injury data collected by road safety partners\n- data which can identify whether some social groups experience more injuries than others (inequalities data)\n- risks to local children and young people\n- information about all types of journey, not just those to and from school.\n- Ensure local children and young people, particularly those from disadvantaged communities, are consulted about their road use and their opinions about the risks involved. In addition, consult parents and carers about their children's road use and safety.\n- Use the reviews and consultation findings to inform local initiatives to reduce road injuries among children and young people.\n- Evaluate the impact of initiatives on local policies (including health inequalities policy), practice and injuries.\n\n【38】 ## Recommendation 19 Aligning local child road safety policies\n- Local authority children's services and their partnerships, in consultation with local safeguarding children boards.\n- Local highway authorities and their road safety partnerships.\n- Review local partners' priorities and strategies to ensure they are coordinated.\n- Involve the local injury prevention coordinator in the development of the child road safety review and liaise with them about consultations with the local community.\n- Ensure consistency between the road injury prevention priorities and strategies within child safety policies, local plans and strategies for children and young people's health and wellbeing, the road safety strategy and local authority community safety plans. (This includes ensuring consistency at all levels within non-unitary organisations.)\n\n【39】 ## Recommendation 20 Promoting and enforcing speed reduction\n- Local highway authorities and their road safety partnerships.\n- Use signage, road design and engineering measures to reduce vehicle speeds on roads where children and young people are likely to be, such as those passing playgrounds or schools .\n- Use signage to warn drivers of the likely presence of children and young people in areas that they frequent (such as schools and playgrounds) and the need to comply with safety measures.\n- Use national and local education and media campaigns to promote the benefits of safety initiatives – including 20 mph speed limits and zones – in areas frequented by children and young people.\n- Evaluate compliance with speed limits.\n- Where evaluation shows that compliance is poor, work with the police to improve it through education and, where necessary, enforcement activities.\n\n【40】 ## Recommendation 21 Involving the police in driver education initiatives and activities to reduce traffic speed\n- Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.\n- The Home Office.\n- Include road safety and enforcement in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) evaluation tools (report cards) to ensure both are considered when police priorities are set.\n- Encourage the police to work with other local partners  on road safety issues in relation to children and young people aged under 15. In particular, encourage the police to contribute to driver education initiatives on the need for compliance with speed limits.\n- Encourage the police to work with the existing road safety partnership (or with relevant agencies if there is no such partnership) to determine areas where vehicle speeds need to be reduced.

In England and Wales in 2008, 208 children and young people aged 0–14 died from such injuries. Around 44% of those deaths were transport-related (Office for National Statistics .\n- In 2009, 65 under-15s were killed and 18,307 were injured on the roads in Great Britain, 2267 of them seriously. Of those killed or seriously injured, 1507 (65%) were pedestrians. Cyclists  and car passengers  made up the bulk of the remainder (that is, cyclists and car passengers each accounted for around 16% of the total) (Department for Transport .\n die from unintentional injuries at home or in leisure environments. For example, in England and Wales in 2008, 55 children died from choking, suffocation or strangling, 17 from drowning and 10 from smoke, fire and flames (Office for National Statistics .\n- Death rates from unintentional injuries are falling .\n- In 2002, nearly 900,000 children and young people in the UK aged under 15 attended hospital following an unintentional injury in the home (Department of Trade and Industry . Over a million children and young people aged under 15 were taken to hospital following an unintentional injury outside their home; 360,000 were injured while at school, 180,000 while playing sport and 33,000 while in a public playground (Department of Trade and Industry .\n be permanently disabled or disd (Eurosafe .\n- Minor unintentional injuries are part of growing up and help children and young people to learn their boundaries and manage risks for themselves. The need to balance encouraging them to explore and develop, and managing the risks to prevent serious injury, was recognised in a government review published in 2009 (Department for Children, Schools and Families 2009a).\n\n【42】 # Risk factors\n- Children and young people from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to be affected by unintentional injuries .\n influence the likelihood of an unintentional injury. These include: personal attributes .\n- While combinations of these factors create the conditions in which unintentional injuries occur, many are preven(Audit Commission and Healthcare Commission .\n\n【43】 # Preventing unintentional injuries\n- Approaches to preventing unintentional injuries range from education .\n- It has been suggested that the most effective strategies use a combination of approaches .\n\n【44】 # Costs\n- There are six million visits to A&E departments in the UK each year as a result of unintentional injuries. Around two million involve children and young people – at a cost to the NHS of approximately £146 million a year (Audit Commission and Healthcare Commission . Further treatment costs are significant. For example, £250,000 may be needed to treat one severe bath water scald (Child Accident Prevention Trust .\n borne by other public sector services such as transport, the police, fire and rescue services and the criminal justice system .\n\n【45】 # Current policy and practice\n\n【46】 - Strategic partnerships and local safeguarding children boards have a duty to promote children and young people's safety as part of the action plan.\n- In addition, the national indicator set for local authorities and local authority partnerships addressed the prevention of injuries among children and young people (Department for Communities and Local Government .\n- Other relevant government initiatives have included:\n- the housing health and safety rating system (Office of the Deputy Prime Minister \n- the child road safety strategy (Department for Transport \n- responsibility for safety in workforce settings (Health and Safety Executive .\n set out guidance on the value of preventing unintended fatalities and injuries (HM Treasury .\n- Local area agreements have provided an opportunity for local authorities, in partnership with the NHS and other organisations, to focus on preventing unintentional injuries. Practice is variable, however some areas are adopting an innovative approach.\n- National indicators NI70: Hospital admissions caused by unintentional and deliberate injuries to children and young people and NI48: Children killed or seriously injured in road traffic accidents.# Considerations\n- The Programme Development Group (PDG) took account of a number of factors and issues when developing the recommendations.\n\n【47】 # General\n- This is one of three pieces of NICE guidance on how to prevent unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15. Several PDG members (including the chair) were co-opted as members of NICE's Public Health Interventions Advisory Committee (PHIAC) to advise on two pieces of guidance developed using NICE's public health intervention process. These covered unintentional injuries on the road and in the home and were published at the same time as this guidance. (For details see section 7.)\n correlate with the number and type of injuries in any given situation. Therefore, the determinants of injury (such as exposure and context) need to be understood. Details such as the nature and duration of the activity – and number of people undertaking it – could be used to supplement injury data and develop this understanding. Care is required when interpreting children and young people's self-reported data, as they may be reluctant to report where they have been and what they have done. In addition, younger children do not have a well-developed sense of time, making their exposure difficult to estimate.\n- Many areas of the home, road and play and leisure environments have hazards which increase the risk of injury. Supervision, safety equipment and education are important to help keep children and young people safe. Equipment has to be maintained to be effective.\n- Some families may not be receptive to advice on how to prevent unintentional injury because of 'fatigue' from repeated contact about other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer.\n- Injury prevention interventions can be passive or active. Passive interventions do not require an active change in behaviour (as an example, they could include the presence of fire resistant materials or air bags in cars).\n- Children are not just small adults. Their physical, psychological and behavioural characteristics make them more vulnerable to injuries than adults. For example, the small stature of young children increases their risk on the road, where they may be masked by parked cars. Similarly, a given amount of a poisonous substance is likely to be more toxic for a child who has a much smaller body mass than an adult .\n- Targeting specific groups may help reduce health inequalities. However, it will have a limited impact on overall injury rates. Targeted and universal approaches are required to reduce both the overall injury rate and health inequalities.\n- Preventing serious injury is important. For every death, there are many more serious injuries which result in hospitalisation and most of these are avoidable.\n\n【48】 # Legislation, regulation and enforcement\n- Caution should be exercised when considering evidence from other countries as different contexts often apply. For example, the drafting and introduction of UK legislation is often preceded by extensive consultation, which is not the case in all countries.\n- Legislation can cover everyone, not just children and young people. For example, home safety regulation that requires gas inspections generally benefits everyone in the home.\n- Numerous mechanisms are available to encourage compliance with safety procedures (for example, enforcement, insurance, health and safety legislation and the use of penalty points for drivers). However, enforcement activities may be more accepin public spaces such as on roads than in private spaces such as the home.\n- Levels of compliance with legislation and regulation are dependent upon having a structured and comprehensive inspection process. For example, Australian studies on swimming pools have found that compliance with safety regulations is more likely if: there is a register of households with swimming pools, there is an annual inspection programme, and penalties are enforced for any breach of the regulations.\n\n【49】 # Injury surveillance\n- In 2002, the Home Accident Surveillance System (HASS) and the Leisure Accident Surveillance System (LASS) both came to an end. Since then, there has been a lack of standardised data collection of unintentional injuries in the home and in leisure settings. 'An in\n- The Programme Development Group (PDG) acknowledged a number of factors that may confound injury data. This includes the following:\n- Road traffic collisions not reported to the police are unlikely to be included in the STATS19 statistics. The actual number of road injuries is thought to be more than three times that in 'Reported road casualties in Great Britain 2009' (Department for Transport .\n lead to a reduction in the number of people taking part in a given activity. Likewise, an initiative to promote physical activity might lead to an increase in the number of injuries due to an increase in the number of participants.\n- A dataset may not include all injuries which occur in localities that lack emergency departments (for example, rural areas where the distance from hospital is a barrier to attendance).\n- Sharing injury data between organisations \n- Injury rates may vary according to the time of year. For example, children and young people's activity patterns may be different during the school term compared with the school holidays.\n- Shortcomings in injury data collection may result from a lack of awareness of the benefits of monitoring and surveillance. \n\n【50】 # Home safety\n- The recommendations on home safety assessments and the supply and installation of home safety equipment are aimed at preventing unintentional injuries among all children and young people aged under 15. However, they prioritise households where children and young people are at greater than average risk of unintentional injuries due to one or more factors. For example, those aged under 5 and those living in social, rented or temporary accommodation with families on a low income are particularly vulnerable.\n- Extensive evidence suggests that socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of childhood injury. Forty-four per cent of lone parents with dependent children are social tenants (Communities and Local Government . Social tenants and often, tenants of private landlords have less income than owner-occupiers.\n- Given the extent of unintentional injuries among children under 5 in the home – and the increased risk of injuries among disadvantaged families, the PDG has made specific recommendations for these groups.\n- The physical environment may have an influence on the rate and type of injuries that occur. For example, high-rise flats often have potential hazards such as balconies, communal stairs and unsecured windows (Child Accident Prevention Trust . In such situations, tenants may not have permission or the resources to make alterations.\n- The evidence available focused on items that need to be fitted to use at home, such as smoke alarms, window restrictors and thermostatic mixing valves (although there was no evidence about some equipment, including carbon monoxide alarms). It does not cover safety devices that do not need installing (for example, those already fitted onto lighters).\n- When interpreting the evidence it should be noted that:\n- housing type and density differs between non-UK and UK studies, so research findings from other countries should be applied with caution\n lessened\n- in studies reporting the effectiveness of thermostatic mixing valves:\n- some may have included scalds from other hot liquids such as drinks (that is, not just scalds caused by bath or shower water)\n- surveillance of their use may itself have contributed to their reported effectiveness, as the people being observed may have been inclined to take more care\n- some suggested that the occupant could reset the device, but it was not reported how often this occurred; the ability to override them could mean the degree of effectiveness demonstrated in studies could change\n- installation of thermostatic mixing valves may change other safety practices, such as reducing the number of times parents check the water temperature before bathing a child. However, this will not increase the risk of scalds if the device is functional and set to an appropriate temperature.\n- It became compulsory to fit thermostatic mixing valves to bath taps in all new homes in England and Wales from 6 April 2010. Thermostatic mixing valves are usually fitted near to the tap, so that most stored hot water remains at a high enough temperature to kill the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease.\n- With the exception of window restrictors, all age groups would benefit from home safety equipment (smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and thermostatic mixing valves). Window restrictors should benefit children aged over 2 as they are capable of climbing and falling from an unguarded window. The age at which window restrictors become ineffective is not clear. However, it is likely that most children can overcome child-resistant mechanisms by the time they reach the age of 5. Key-operated locks (where the key is inaccessible to a child) tend to be effective for longer. It is important to note the need to open windows in a fire emergency.\n- As more smoke alarms are installed than any other type of safety equipment, there is less potential to use them to reduce health inequalities.\n- Gaining access to people's homes needs sensitive consideration.  The PDG acknowledge that the home is a private space and access will involve discussion and negotiation with residents.\n\n【51】 # Outdoor play and leisure\n- The PDG agreed with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) that children should be \"as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible\". Children and young people learn, develop and mature when playing and taking part in activities that challenge them and that sometimes involves taking risks. Play and leisure activities help children and young people to learn about the complex relationship between themselves and the world in which they live. Exposure to a degree of challenge may be beneficial during these activities. However, a distinction should be made between manageable and unmanageable situations:\n- Some challenging situations are manageable and help a child to develop physically and emotionally. For example, undertaking a familiar activity without adult supervision is likely to be manageable.\n- In other situations, the risks may be too difficult for a child to assess and manage, or are unlikely to lead to any obvious benefits. They may even expose the child to danger. Examples would be swimming in a disused quarry, or playing on poorly designed and maintained equipment in a play area.\n- Parents' and carers' and their child's perception of safety can influence the amount of time children and young people spend on outdoor play and leisure activities. These perceptions can be influenced by the media. In addition, fear of litigation can influence the nature and extent of activities provided by educational and play organisations.\n difficult to regulate inland waterways not currently used for supervised recreation.\n- The classification of a leisure activity is not always clear. For example, when a child is cycling it's not always clear whether cycling is a leisure activity or is being used as a form of transport. Similarly, it's not always clear whether a child or young person is playing in water or swimming, playing with a ball or participating in sport.\n- Media campaigns to promote injury prevention activities may increase health inequalities, as uptake is likely to vary among different groups. \n- The PDG acknowledged that dividing on- and off-road cycling into two separate activities was an artificial division, particularly in relation to older children. The scope of the guidance did not include equipment used to prevent against unintentional injuries on the road. However, it did cover outdoor play and leisure, so the use of helmets in parks, on bridleways and in other environments was reviewed. (Children often fall off their bikes, especially when they are learning to ride a bicycle and when they are learning BMX and mountain bike skills, so there is a need to protect them from unnecessary injury.)\n- Recommendations have been made about promoting cycle helmets but not about making them compulsory. The PDG was aware of the debate on cycle helmets.\n- The PDG considered a number of issues in relation to the use of helmets including the:\n- need to purchase one when buying a bike\n- need to include helmets as part of rent-a-bike schemes\n- need to introduce them into the informal secondhand bike market (which includes passing bikes down and between families)\n- design and fitting\n- fact that some adults are poor role models when it comes to helmet wearing\n- need to wear them for other activities such as skateboarding and some high-risk water sports\n- potential for injury if they are worn when using equipment not designed for their use (such as playground equipment) or are used in other inappropriate ways.\n needed, as these are common and can result in disability and deformity.\n different because they are only on sale here for short periods of time. For example, retailers and display organisers are granted temporary licences to sell them in advance of Bonfire Night and other festivals.\n\n【52】 # Road safety\n noted that children living in deprived areas (and those from some minority ethnic groups) are more likely than the general population to make journeys alone or only supervised by an older sibling.\n- Most studies on traffic speed are conducted on the main road network. Fewer are conducted on minor residential roads where children and young people are more likely to be present.\n- The PDG acknowledged that injury prevention activities should take into account the importance of public transport and sustainable travel modes, such as walking and cycling, which have known health benefits. Reducing traffic speed should help to encourage physically active modes of travel.\n- Most studies focus on the evaluation of legislation which is enforced by imposing sanctions on those who break the rules. This is because data on the effect of such interventions are more readily available than for less punitive measures. Although the latter may be equally effective, they have not been recommended due to a lack of evidence.\n- Transport studies tend to use a 'before-and-after' design. They estimate the relationship between two or more factors using data collected at a number of specified intervals over a period of time.  They require an adequate control to demonstrate causality.\n- Children and young people cannot influence the speed or general manner in which vehicles are driven or whether seatbelts are available. In addition, they often have little or no choice about their mode of travel.\n- The evidence review on the effectiveness of safety cameras which informed evidence statement 3.1 only included systematic reviews. One of these has since been updated  reports differential effects on children, for urban and rural environments and for fixed and mobile cameras. The cost effectiveness review which informed evidence statement 6.5 used primary sources, including the National Safety Camera Programme.\n\n【53】 # Limitations of the evidence\n- The recommendations reflect the evidence identified and the PDG's discussions. The absence of recommendations on any particular measures to prevent unintentional injuries is a result of a lack of evidence that met the inclusion criteria for the evidence reviews. It should not be taken as a judgement on whether or not any such measures are effective and cost effective.\n- Repeated testing of outcome measures can affect the validity of an evaluation. For example, a variable that is extreme when first measured will tend to be closer to the mean when measured later. If this statistical effect is not taken into account, caution will need to be exercised when interpreting any conclusions about an intervention's effectiveness.\n- Many injury prevention programmes do not lend themselves to the use of 'blinding' (whereby participants are not aware which research study group they have been allocated to). However, it is often possible to have evaluators who are 'blind' to group allocation.\n- Although interventions often include adults, children and young people, the outcomes for children and young people are not reported separately.\n- Studies of the effectiveness of strategic approaches to injury prevention (such as legislation and enforcement) did not provide a strong evidence base for economic modelling.  As a result, most of the assumptions or variables used in the modelling are based on very limited or estimated data and the conclusions should be treated with caution.# Recommendations for research\n- The Programme Development Group (PDG) recommends that the following research questions should be addressed to fill the most important gaps in the evidence in relation to this and the other two pieces of NICE guidance that were published in November 2010. These form part of a 'suite' of NICE advice on preventing unintentional injuries:\n- Unintentional injuries in the home: interventions for under 15s (NICE guideline PH.\n- Unintentional injuries on the road: interventions for under 15s (NICE guideline PH.\n takes into account any harmful or negative side effects.\n on the:\n- short and long-term effects (physical, psychological and financial) on children, young people, their parents and carers (for example, time away from school for children and work for parents and extent of residual disability)\n- long-term quality-of-life and public sector cost impacts of non-fatal injuries.\n\n【54】 # Epidemiology and behaviour\n- What are the recent epidemiological and aetiological trends in types, causes and impact of unintentional injuries among under-15s? Use data collected by the recommended surveillance systems  to identify findings for specific groups and activities in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure. Factors to consider are:\n- cause, nature, location and factors involved in the incident and type, site and severity of injury\n- numbers of children and young people involved, time spent undertaking the activity and the extent of supervision\n- demographic details with data presented for subgroups of children and young people (for example, grouped according to age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability and place of residence).\n- How do parents, carers, children and young people perceive risk in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure – and how do they perceive the risks and benefits inherent in specific activities? How do these perceptions vary between populations and subgroups based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, or other characteristics of the participants or their environment? How strongly associated is children and young people's exposure to risk with their behaviour, the causes, incidence and severity of unintentional injury?\n- Does exposure to risk and the opportunity to experience risk-taking have a beneficial effect on children and young people? Does the effect vary according to age and other socio-demographic factors or according to the quality and nature of the risk?\n- To what extent – and how – does children and young people's behaviour alter when their environment is made safer? How does children and young people's (and their parents' and carers') perception of risk impact on the amount and type of physical activity undertaken by children and young people?\n\n【55】 # Effectiveness studies\n- What is the differential effectiveness and cost effectiveness of legislation, regulation, policies and standards to prevent unintentional injuries in the UK? Studies should consider the process and cost of development, promotion, implementation and enforcement. They should collect baseline data prior to any change and for a meaningful length of time afterwards on:\n- home safety assessments, thermostatic mixing valves (TMVs), smoke alarms (hard-wired and 10-year battery-operated), carbon monoxide alarms and window restrictors\n- water safety initiatives, sports rules and regulations, cycling skills training for children and young people and cycle helmet use\n- road safety knowledge and skills, road user behaviour, different types of road signage, differential effectiveness of speed enforcement (networked, targeted or mixed approaches) in rural and residential areas.\n- How effective and cost effective are social marketing and mass-media campaigns in support of legislation, regulation, policy and standards to reduce unintentional injuries among children and young people in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure?\n- What is the impact of injury prevention training and development initiatives on those involved in preventing injuries in terms of their level of knowledge and degree of competency? What impact do such initiatives have on the scope and quality of preventive activities? Examples of training and developmental initiatives include: training people to undertake home risk assessments and educating representatives of community partnerships and private landlords about the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).\n- What prevents and what encourages children and young people to comply with legislation, regulation and standards to prevent unintentional injuries in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure?\n- What prevents and what encourages delivery and implementation of policies/strategies to prevent unintentional injuries among children and young people in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure? (These are outlined, for example, in white and green papers and policy briefings.)\n\n【56】 # Interventions: all settings\n- How do the following factors influence the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions to prevent unintentional injury in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure:\n- method of delivery (for example, session format, learning materials)\n- content\n- frequency and duration of follow-ups\n- deliverer\n- parental/carer involvement\n- demographic characteristics of the participants (for example, gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and disability)?\n- What are the most effective and cost-effective ways of providing under-15s, their parents and carers with information, advice and education about safety and hazards in the home, on the road and in outdoor play and leisure environments?\n- To what extent do interventions to prevent unintentional injuries among under-15s in the home, on the road and during outdoor play and leisure impact on the household's safety knowledge and behaviour? What role do family members and carers (fathers, mothers, grandparents and extended family units) play in preventing unintentional injuries?\n\n【57】 # Interventions: road safety\n- To what extent do interventions to reduce speed and prevent unintentional injuries on the road among under-15s influence people's attitude, knowledge and behaviour towards road safety (both drivers and the general public)? How can interventions be designed to maximise this effect?\n- How can systematic methods, combining health and engineering research, be developed to:\n- assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of injury prevention interventions outside the health sector (for example, within education and employment)\n- identify wider public health outcomes as a standard part of research into engineering measures to reduce speed and unintentional injuries (including co-benefits and unintended consequences, such as the impact on physical activity and air quality)?\n\n【58】 # Interventions: home safety\n- How effective and cost effective are home safety interventions (including combined interventions) in preventing unintentional injuries among different population groups? For example, how effective are they in relation to participants' gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, or other characteristics? To what extent does effectiveness and cost effectiveness vary according to the type of injury being prevented?\n- To what extent does the provision of safety information, advice and education during a home safety intervention contribute to its effectiveness and cost effectiveness? (For example, does it reduce the number – and severity – of unintentional injuries in the home among under-15s?)\n- How effective and cost effective are the different methods used to deliver safety information, advice and education? To what extent do effectiveness and cost effectiveness vary with different types of injury prevention activity?\n\n【59】 # Interventions: play and leisure\n- To what extent does exposure to risk during outdoor play and leisure affect children and young people's risk-management skills in the setting where the hazard was encountered, other designated play areas, non-designated play areas and non-play settings?More detail on the gaps in the evidence identified during development of this guidance is provided in appendix D.# Updating the recommendations\n- This guidance will be reviewed 3 years after publication to determine whether all or part of it should be updated.

They formed the starting point for the reviews of evidence and were used by the PDG to help develop the recommendations. The overarching questions were:\n- Which approaches are effective and cost effective in preventing or reducing unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15?\n- Which approaches are effective and cost effective in preventing or reducing unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15 from disadvantaged families?\n- Which types of approach effectively (and cost effectively) support and help develop the skills of professionals and others involved in childhood injury prevention?\n- What type of monitoring systems are effective and cost effective in recording and detecting changes in the type, incidence and prevalence of unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15?\n- What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing initiatives to prevent unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15?\n- These questions were made more specific for each review .\n\n【64】 # Reviewing the evidence\n\n【65】 ## Effectiveness reviews\n- Five reviews of effectiveness were conducted. One compared international practice (review , one covered quantitative correlates (review  and three were reviews of effectiveness (reviews 3–.\n\n【66】 ## Identifying the evidence\n to June 2009  and 1990 to July :\n- Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews\n- Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)\n- EPPI Centre databases (Bibliomap, DoPHER, TRoPHI)\n- Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC)\n- Kings Fund catalogue and Department of Health data\n- Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\n- MEDLINE\n- NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED)\n- SafetyLit\n- Social Science Citation Index\n- The Campbell Collaboration\n to June 2009  and 1990 to July :\n- Assia\n- Cinahl\n- Cochrane Injuries Group Register\n- EconLit\n- Embase\n- ISI Web of Science\n- International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD)1\n- PsycINFO\n- SPORTDiscus\n- Transport Research Information Service (via the TRIS)\n- Transport Research Laboratory\n- Website searches included:\n- Child accident prevention trust (CAPT)\n- Eurosafe\n- Injury Observatory for Britain and Ireland (IOBI)\n- Institute of Highway Incorporated Engineers\n- Institute of Home Safety\n- Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)\n- Royal Town Planning Institute\n- Safe routes to school\n- South West Public Health Observatory\n- UK Department for Transport (DfT)\n- For review 1, searches were primarily conducted by snowball sampling of key organisations and individual contacts, supplemented by Internet searches, including the web pages of international and national organisations. For reviews 2–5, electronic searches of relevant bibliographic databases and selected websites were supplemented by communication with experts and organisations involved in the relevant research or policy areas.\n- Further details of the databases, search terms and strategies are included in the review reports.\n\n【67】 ## Selection criteria\n- Studies were included in reviews 1 and 2 if they were published between 1997 and 2009 in English. In addition:\n- Review 1 included studies which reported separately for children in at least two countries (or 'country-sized' regions).\n- Review 2 focused on observational research and intervention studies which quantified the association or relationship between unintentional injuries among children and two or more variables such as exposure to a particular environment or socioeconomic status.\n- Studies were included in reviews 3–5 if they:\n- were published between January 1990 and February 2009 in English\n- used comparative studies to compare groups of people, places or activities\n- More detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for individual reviews can be found on our website.\n\n【68】 ## Quality appraisal\n- For reviews 1 and 3 to 5, the included papers were assessed for methodological rigour and quality using the NICE methodology checklist, as set out in the NICE technical manual 'Methods for the development of NICE public health guidance' . Each study was graded (++, +, –) to reflect the risk of potential bias arising from its design and execution.\n++  All or most of the checklist criteria have been fulfilled, where they have not been fulfilled the conclusions are very unlikely to alter.\n- Some of the checklist criteria have been fulfilled. Those criteria that have not been fulfilled or not adequately described are unlikely to alter the conclusions.\n–  Few or no checklist criteria have been fulfilled. The conclusions of the study are likely or very likely to alter.\n- The main reasons for studies being assessed as (–) were:\n- lack of control or comparison group\n- lack of baseline equivalence/data\n- inadequately described interventions\n- inadequate analysis and reporting of data.\n assessed for their applicability to the area under investigation and the evidence statements were graded as follows:\n- Directly applicable.\n- Partially applicable.\n- Not applicable.\n\n【69】 ## Summarising the evidence and making evidence statements\n- The review data was summarised in evidence s .\n- The findings from the reviews were synthesised and used as the basis for a number of evidence statements relating to each key question. The evidence statements were prepared by the public health collaborating centres . The statements reflect their judgement of the strength (quality, quantity and consistency) of evidence and its applicability to the populations and settings in the scope.\n\n【70】 # Cost effectiveness\n- There was a review of economic evaluations and an economic modelling exercise.\n\n【71】 ## Review of economic evaluations\n- This sought to identify and review economic evaluations published since 1990 of relevant legislation, regulation or other strategic approaches of interest. The search was undertaken in two stages.\n- First the RefMan database was searched for 'hits' from the five reviews and two related pieces of NICE public health guidance (preventing unintentional injuries to children on the road and in the home).\n- Second, a new search was carried out in EconLit and NHSEED (NHS Economic Evaluation Database) using text words and thesaurus terms covering all types of injuries among children.\n\n【72】 ## Economic modelling\n- An economic model was constructed to explore the cost-effectiveness of jurisdiction-wide strategic approaches to prevent unintentional injuries among children aged under 15 years.  The exploratory analyses were conducted from a UK public sector perspective.\n- Two different strategic policies were explored: to reduce unintentional injuries among children and adults on the road and at home. The former focused on legislation or regulations, supported by other activities, introducing mandatory 20mph zones in high casualty residential areas. The latter focused on legislation or regulations, supported by other activities, to promote installation of thermostatic mixer valves in family social housing where children are aged less than 5 years.\n- Due to a paucity of data, the model explored which factors might be important in determining cost effectiveness.\n- The results are reported in: Economic modelling of legislation/regulations and related national strategies to promote the wider use of: 20 mph zones in residential areas, and TMVs in social housing for families.\n\n【73】 # Fieldwork\n- Fieldwork was carried out to evaluate how relevant and useful NICE's recommendations would be for practitioners and how feasible it would be to put them into practice.\n included health visitors, nurses and policy leads, within the NHS, those working in the fire and police services, leisure and play services, and environmental health and housing.\n- The fieldwork comprised:\n- Seven discussion groups conducted in Lancashire, South East London and Sussex by Word of Mouth research consultancy.\n included: an assistant school head, a cycle events organiser and a cycle retailer, further education college curriculum managers, healthy schools managers, paediatricians, staff from children's centres, a safer communities manager, a school governor, social workers and voluntary sector children's services managers.\n- The main issues arising are set out in appendix C under 'Fieldwork findings'. The full fieldwork report Strategies to prevent unintentional injury among under-15s is available online.\n\n【74】 # Howthe PDGformulatedtherecommendations\n- At its meetings between February 2009 and July 2010, the Programme Development Group (PDG) considered the evidence, expert testimony and cost effectiveness to determine:\n- whether there was sufficient evidence (in terms of strength and applicability) to form a judgement\n- where relevant, whether (on balance) the evidence demonstrates that the intervention or programme can be effective or is inconclusive\n- where relevant, the typical size of effect (where there is one)\n- whether the evidence is applicable to the target groups and context covered by the guidance.\n- The PDG developed draft recommendations through informal consensus, based on the following criteria:\n- Strength (type, quality, quantity and consistency) of the evidence.\n- The applicability of the evidence to the populations and settings referred to in the scope.\n- Effect size and potential impact on the target population's health.\n- Impact on inequalities in health between different groups of the population.\n- Equality and diversity legislation.\n- Ethical issues and social value judgements.\n- Cost effectiveness (for the NHS and other public sector organisations).\n- Balance of harms and benefits.\n- Ease of implementation and any anticipated changes in practice.\n\n【75】 - The draft guidance, including the recommendations, was released for consultation in May 2010. At its meeting in July 2010, the PDG amended the guidance in light of comments from stakeholders and experts and the fieldwork. The guidance was signed off by the NICE Guidance Executive in October 2010.# C: The evidence\n- This appendix lists the evidence statements from six reviews provided by the public health collaborating centre  and links them to the relevant recommendations\n lists six expert testimonies and their links to the recommendations and sets out a brief summary of findings from the economic analysis.\n- The six evidence reviews are:\n- Review 1: 'Current practice and innovative approaches to prevent childhood unintentional injuries: An overview and synthesis of international comparative analyses and surveys of injury prevention policies, legislation and other activities'.\n- Review 2: 'A systematic review of risk factors for unintentional injuries among children and young people aged under 15 years'.\n- Review 3: 'An overview and synthesis of evidence relating to strategies and frameworks for planning, implementing, enforcing or promoting activities to prevent unintentional injury to children and young people on the road: legislation, regulation, standards and related strategies focusing on the design and modification of highways, roads or streets'.\n- Review 4: 'Strategic and regulatory frameworks for guiding, enforcing or promoting activities to prevent unintentional injury in children and young people in the home environment'.\n- Review 5: 'Strategies, policies and regulatory or legal frameworks and/or mass media campaigns to prevent unintentional injury to children during play and leisure in the external environment'.\n- Review 6: 'Preventing unintentional injuries in children.

However for road safety, evidence from two ecological studies (one  and one ), suggest a weak trend towards better performing countries (in terms of child fatality rates) having more road environment modification and road design measures in place.\n\n【79】 ## Evidence Statement 1.3\n- Evidence from one (++) ecological study indicates that differences in the distribution of exposure in the road environment for child pedestrians (in particular relating to time spent near busy main roads) can explain some of the difference in severe child injury and fatality rates between Great Britain and two other northern European countries, France and the Netherlands.\n\n【80】 ## Evidence statement 2.2\n- There is evidence from 10 studies (one UK). There is evidence of a strong association (that is, relative risk equivalent of greater than 2. of injuries being associated with travelling in a car driven by a non-sibling teenager. There is evidence of weak to moderate association (that is, relative risk equivalent of greater than 1.0 to less than 2. of injuries with lower parental income, employment status, educational status, socioeconomic status, and with travelling in a car with a female driver (when the injured child was appropriately restrained). The increased risk in females may well reflect their longer periods of time in the presence of children. There is mixed evidence regarding the association of injuries with ethnicity.\n\n【81】 ## Evidence statement 2.3\n- There is evidence from 18 studies (five UK). There is evidence of a strong association between the lowest socioeconomic quintiles, being of Native American descent (for pedestrians), having parents who were migrants, hyperactivity, behavioural difficulties, or bicycle riding (riding slowly or only on the pavement) and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with membership of the second socioeconomic quintile, social deprivation, non-professional parental occupation, rural and mixed-urban environments, being male, or behavioural disorders. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with social fragmentation or ethnicity (for cyclists).\n\n【82】 ## Evidence statement 2.4\n- There is evidence from seven studies (one UK). There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with socioeconomic deprivation and being African-American. There is mixed evidence regarding the association of socioeconomic status (measured by parental occupation) with injuries. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with autism.\n\n【83】 ## Evidence statement 2.5\n- There is evidence from six studies (one UK) on burns and fire in the home of a strong association between child's age (less than 1 year), low mother education and age, and areas of concentrated poverty (and high numbers of African-American population) and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of burn injuries with children being male, from an ethnic minority, having behavioural problems and a poor reading score, low parental education, lower home income, a larger number of children in the home, and rural location. There was no statistical evidence of burn injuries being associated with type of home ownership.\n\n【84】 ## Evidence statement 2.7\n- There is evidence from three studies (none UK) on falls in the home of a strong association between greater child's age (older than 1 year) and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with: being male, of African-American descent, families being in receipt of social welfare benefits, lower educational status of parents, lower income, single parent households, lower mother's age at childbirth, non-owner housing occupancy, living in a flat or farmhouse, older housing and being a migrant.  Being lone parent status, neighbourhood poverty and living in cities were not statistically associated with falls.\n\n【85】 ## Evidence statement 2.8\n- There is evidence from seven studies (one UK) on poisoning in the home of a strong association between child's age (from 1 to 4 years), behavioural problems, and autism and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries being associated with: being male, having a lower reading score, lower educational status of parents, lower income, larger families, being in receipt of social welfare benefits, younger age of mother at childbirth, being of Native American descent, living in the country, and the birth of a sibling within 12 months (for iron t poisoning). There was no statistical evidence of injuries beingassociated with single parent households, family size, overcrowding, or house type.\n\n【86】 ## Evidence statement 2.9\n- There is evidence from two studies (one UK) on undefined causes of injury in the home of weak to moderate association of injuries with lower educational status of parents and lower family income. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with parental marital status or of being in receipt of social welfare benefits.\n\n【87】 ## Evidence statement 2.10\n- There is evidence from four studies (none UK). There is evidence of a strong association between the use of public playgrounds or being of African-American descent and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries being with being of Latin American descent, location of a school within an urban area, schools with larger numbers of classes (greater than or equal to , longer school hours, and the levels of physical activity engaged in outside of school. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with the levels of physical activity engaged in within school.\n\n【88】 ## Evidence statement 2.11\n- There is evidence from six studies (one UK) on burns and fire in all environments of a strong association between the most socioeconomically deprived families, living in a house with one to three or more bedrooms, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and being of Native American descent and injuries. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with autism, having previously endured an unintentional burn/fire injury, parental employment status, entitlement to Medicaid, or order of sibling birth.\n\n【89】 ## Evidence statement 2.12\n- There is evidence from three studies (none UK). There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with entitlement to Medicaid (in children aged 5 to 14 years) and with non-entitlement to Medicaid (in infants aged 0 to 4 years). There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with being of Native-American descent or the presence of behavioural disorders.\n\n【90】 ## Evidence statement 2.14a\n- There is evidence from 12 studies (four UK) on all injury types in all environments of a strong association (compared with newborns aged up to 6 weeks) between children aged 7–24 months and injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with increasing age (4 years or older versus younger than 4 years), children aged 15–54 months (versus younger than 6 months), and increasing age among children with a disability. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with increasing age in the case of head injuries.\n\n【91】 ## Evidence statement 2.14b\n- There is evidence from 16 studies (four UK). There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries (of all severities, including fatalities) with being male.\n\n【92】 ## Evidence statement 2.14c\n- There is mixed evidence from eight studies (one UK) on ethnicity in all injury types in all environments regarding the association of child ethnicity with injuries. There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with being of black or Native American descent. There was no statistical evidence of injuries being associated with being of Asian descent or a wide range of other ethnicities.\n\n【93】 ## Evidence statement 2.14f\n- There is evidence from 27 studies (six UK) on family's socioeconomic status in all injury types in all environments of weak to moderate association of injuries with socioeconomic deprivation. There is no statistical evidence of injuries (reported in some studies) being associated with socioeconomic deprivation within certain age categories. There is mixed evidence regarding the association of parental educational attainment and household income with injuries.\n\n【94】 ## Evidence statement 2.14i\n- There is evidence from eight studies (four UK). There is evidence of weak to moderate association of injuries with socioeconomic deprivation, but no evidence of association between other indicators of neighbourhood disadvantage and the occurrence of unintentional injuries.\n\n【95】 ## Evidence Statement 3.1\n concluded that similar size of speed reduction effects were observed over wider geographical areas around the enforcement device sites. The size of the observed reductions in different studies, and in different localities within studies, varies considerably. Similarly, one systematic review (++) found that in those studies where enforcement devices were temporarily placed at certain locations, the duration of speed reductions after removal of the devices (the 'time halo') varied from 1 day to 8 weeks. However, only one of the systematic reviews (++) was able to identify any factor which was consistently associated with higher injury or crash reductions – this was that the effect on urban roads was greater than that on rural roads. There was insufficient consistency between studies to enable the detection of the effects of other factors (such as different roads user groups, automated versus non-automated detection, mobile versus fixed, covert versus overt, or other roads versus motorway.). The greater effect on urban roads where children are more likely to be pedestrians is relevant. Included studies did not consistently state what the penalties or fines would be for detected speeding, although one systematic review (++) implied there was a relationship between size of pre- and post-reduction in speeding vehicles and the speed threshold set.\n- This evidence is judged as directly applicable to the UK as the results from the UK studies were generally consistent with the studies from other developed countries.\n\n【96】 ## Evidence Statement 3.2\n moderate evidence from one (+) controlled before-and-after study, on motorways in the Netherlands, that increasing the intensity of enforcement – from apprehending 1 in 100 speeding offenders, to 1 in 25, to 1 in 6 – produces statistically significant (p less than 0. reductions in mean speed (1 km per hour for 1:25 versus 1:100; and 3.5 km per hour for 1:6 versus 1:.\n- This evidence is judged as partially applicable to road safety policy in the UK. This is because in the included studies there are a number of differences in the way police forces are organised and contribute to speed enforcement.  Also, in the role of the police in enforcing speed limits through speed traps and mobile cameras/radar needs to be considered in the context of the widespread use of fixed site automated cameras around the UK road network.\n\n【97】 ## Evidence statement 4.1\n- There is evidence from one controlled before-and-after study (+) in the USA that law requiring the installation of smoke detectors, increases the number of houses which have at least one functioning smoke detector and that this may reduce fatalities related to fires in targeted properties.\n- Knowledge of the law and the penalty for non-compliance may be associated with greater smoke detector installation than knowledge of the law only.\n- The law assessed required smoke detectors in all bedroom areas of one-, two- and multi-family dwellings, applied retrospectively to homes built prior to the law, and can be enforced by a fine or jail time.  In addition, sale of a property is contingent on appropriate smoke detectors being present.\n- Given the differences in legal systems, responsibilities and enforcement between the USA and the UK, and the high socioeconomic status of the studies communities, the applicability of this finding has been assessed as poor. However, the observations that systems of enforcement which involve regular inspection, with a system of warnings prior to prosecution are effective; that laws which reflect societal laws are effective and that media campaigns to support the introduction of new laws may be important, may be applicable across other settings.\n\n【98】 ## Evidence statement 4.2\n- There is evidence from one comparative study in the USA (+) that window guard legislation in New York City reduces child injury related to falls from buildings by about half, despite greater numbers at risk as residents of multiple-family dwellings (1.5 per 100,000 children aged 0–18 years compared with an average of 2.81 per 100,000 in 27 other US states without legislation, and 3 per 100,000 in Massachusetts which introduced interventions without legislation). The law required owners of multiple-family dwellings to provide window guards in apartments where children aged 10 or under lived (half the injuries recorded in NYC were in those aged 11–. Compliance was subject to annual enforcement. The introduction of the law was accompanied by a coordinated education and advertising programme ('Children can't fly') which involved outreach, dissemination of literature, a media campaign and the distribution of free window guards.\n- Given the differences in legal systems, responsibilities and enforcement between the USA and the UK, and the differences in housing stock and management, the applicability of this finding has been assessed as poor.  However, the observation that effective enforcement is a key element of legislative success may be applicable across a range of settings.\n\n【99】 ## Evidence statement 4.3\n- There is mixed evidence from four uncontrolled before-and-after studies (all , two from the US and two from Australia) about hot water tap temperature legislation. Two studies (one US and one Australia) reported that the annual incidence of burn injuries in children aged 4–13 years increased after the introduction of legislation, and a US study found that injury rates were raised compared to the period immediately prior to legislation being introduced but fell in relation to an earlier comparator time-period. Only one Australian study (+) reported p-values, but this was a significant increase (p = 0\n- One study (Australia) suggested there may be a decrease in the number of scald injuries in children aged 0–4 years, however, the reported differences were non-significant (p = 0\n- Given the differences in legal systems, responsibilities and enforcement between the USA and Australia and the UK, and the differences in housing stock and management, the applicability of these findings have been assessed as poor. However, the observation that legislation aimed at safety in the home may be limited in its effectiveness where it is implemented only in that housing stock where access and enforcement is easier (such as in rented or newly built accommodation only), may be applicable across a range of settings.\n\n【100】 ## Evidence statement 4.4\n- There is mixed evidence from four studies (two case control, and two comparative) about swimming pool fencing legislation (two  one from USA and one from Australia and two  one from New Zealand and one from Australia).\n- Two studies (both , one USA and one Australia) suggest that legislation is ineffective where it only requires three-sided fencing. The US study suggests no impact of such legislation on drowning in children aged younger than 10 years compared to no legislation (odds ratio  1.27, 95% confidence interval  0.72 to 2 The Australian study found the incident rate ratio of drowning in children aged  younger than 5 years living in houses with three-sided rather than four-sided pool fencing was 1.78 (95% CI 1.14 to 1\n- Three studies, two (-) and one (+) (two Australia, one New Zealand) report on outcomes related to legislative management and compliance.\n suggest that lack of clarity in the Fencing Act, and failure to detail how councils should ensure compliance, including how it should be funded, hampered effective implementation.\n- The Western Australia study (+) suggests that compliance is highest immediately after legislation is introduced, and falls off thereafter, although regular inspection enhances compliance. The New Zealand study (-) found no association with compliance rates and: local authorities having written policies about locating and inspecting pools; a re-inspection programme; or advertising of pool owners' obligations under the relevant act.\n- Given the differences in legal systems, responsibilities and enforcement between the USA, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and the low level of private swimming pool ownership in the UK, the applicability of these findings have been assessed as poor. However, some key lessons from these studies may be applicable across a range of settings, such as: the importance of adequate legal requirements in order to glean maximum benefit (as illustrated by three- versus four-sided fencing here); the need for regular inspection regimes which are consistently enforced, and the related need for clear lines of responsibility and sufficient funding for these; the need for concurrent education to help owners comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law (for example, the need for maintenance of equipment, and the valuing of safety over convenience) and finally the need for legislation which does not contradict or confuse other existing rulings.\n\n【101】 ## Evidence statement 5.3\n moderate evidence from uncontrolled before-and-after data from one of the studies (-) that the programmes helped to reduce the rates of bicycle-related head injuries in the intervention area.\n- In the US study (+), the sales of one brand of a youth helmet in the Seattle area (intervention area) rose from 1,500 to 22,000 over a 3-year period (no s stated for the control area) while observed helmet usage rate among school-age children increased from 5% to 16% compared with a rise of only 1% to 3% in a control community, Portland, Oregon, over the same period.\n- In the UK study (-) self-reported helmet use among young people aged 11–15 years living in the campaign area increased from 11% at the start of the campaign to 31% after 5 years (p < 0., with no significant change in the control group. Hospital casualty s in the campaign area (Reading) for cycle-related head injuries in the under 16 years age group, fell from 112.5 per 100,000 to 60.8 per 100,000 (from 21.6% of all cycle injuries to 11.7%; p < 0 No injury data were provided for Basingstoke, the control. Applicability: The evidence is judged to be directly applicable to the UK – one of the studies was carried out in the UK and although the other was carried out in the US, it was embarked upon and completed before the introduction of a bicycle helmet legislation, so in a sense the settings reflected what is currently obtainable in the UK, a country without mandatory helmet wearing legislation. Furthermore, both countries are similar in terms of living standards and economic development.\n\n【102】 ## Evidence statement 5.4\n- There is mixed evidence from two controlled before-and-after studies (both , one from Canada and one from the UK) that removal and replacement of unsafe equipment to comply with regulatory standards is an effective strategy for preventing playground injuries. The Canadian study demonstrated statistically non-significant reduction in equipment-related injury rate in the intervention schools after replacement of equipment using the new Canadian Standards Association standards (relative risk  = 0.82 to 0.66 to 1 This translated into 177 equipment-related injuries avoided during the study period. The comparable equipment-related injury rate in the non-intervention schools increased by about 15% after the study period, although not statistically significant (RR = 1.15; 95% CI 0.96 to 1 The overall injury rate reduced in the intervention schools (RR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.62 to 0. and increased in the non-intervention schools (RR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.07 to 2. after the study period. However, in the UK study, injury rate per observed child was significantly reduced in the five playgrounds where changes (use of greater depth of bark and replacement of overhead horizontal ladders with rope climbing frame) had been made compared to the control playgrounds without changes.\n- Applicability: The non‐UK study is only partially applicable to the current UK context due to similarities in level of economic development, nature of the playgrounds, as well as targeted populations. The UK study findings are directly applicable.\n\n【103】 ## Evidence statement 5.5\n- There is weak evidence from two before-and-after studies (one  and one , from UK and Italy) and one retrospective time series (one  from UK) on the effect of fireworks legislation and enforcement activities on firework-related injuries.\n- One study in Italy (+) reported that a comprehensive, multifaceted programme, comprising the combination of enforcement of fireworks law, media campaign and education, reduced the rate of fireworks-related injury from 10 per 100,000 before the intervention programme to 6.1 per 100,000 after it was implemented, and a time-series based study found that amendments to restrictive fireworks legislation led to a reduction of firework-related injury in children.\n- The study from Northern Ireland (-) did not find a significant increase in fireworks-related injuries requiring hospital admission following liberalisation of the law on fireworks sale (incidence of admissions before: 0.38 per 100,000; after: 0.43 per 100,. However, the annual number of injuries in this study was already very small relative to annual variations.\n- Applicability: The Italian study is partially applicable to current UK context while the UK findings are directly applicable. However, the Northern Ireland study may not be directly applicable to the rest of UK because of the civil unrest reported in that part of the kingdom.\n\n【104】 ## Evidence statement 6.5\n- There were two cost-benefit analyses which assessed the impact of speed enforcement programmes. The photo radar programme in British Columbia was estimated to produce net benefits to society of about C$114 million (in , and still produced substantial net savings of C$38 million if only considered from the provincial insurance corporation's perspective.\n the over £30 million in the estimated annual value to society of accidents avoided. In all ten police force areas there was a positive net present value (that is, benefits exceeded costs) within a year of the programme starting.\n use data from both speed and red light camera sites, although at speed camera sites the reductions in personal injury collisions were associated with reductions in speeds.\n\n【105】 # Additional evidence\n\n【106】 ## Expert testimony\n- Expert testimony 1: 'Child road safety' (including 'Child casualties in road accidents: 2007. Road accidents factsheet number 5 ' )\n- Expert testimony 3: 'Inequities in child injuries'\n- Expert testimony 6: 'Monitoring and surveillance issues – A&E pilot'.\n\n【107】 # Cost-effectiveness evidence\n- The modelling  explored the potential cost effectiveness of a selection of strategic approaches to encouraging the uptake of interventions to prevent unintentional injuries among children.\n- The cost and effectiveness of implementation was the most important factor in relation to legislation or regulations promoting 20 mph zones. The cost of introducing that legislation or regulation – or of enforcing and monitoring compliance – was much less significant.\n- Several factors determined the cost effectiveness of legislation, regulations and other strategies to promote the earlier and wider installation of thermostatic mixing valves in social housing used by families with young children. These were:\n- expected level of uptake and installation following the introduction of regulations\n- number of years before all social housing has one fitted, given the expected uptake after regulations are introduced\n- cost of enforcing and monitoring compliance\n- number of social housing households that would be eligible for a thermostatic mixing valve under the regulations.\n\n【108】 # Fieldwork findings\n- Fieldwork aimed to test the relevance, usefulness and feasibility of putting the recommendations into practice. The PDG considered the findings when developing the final recommendations. For details, go to the fieldwork section in appendix B and 'Strategies to prevent unintentional injury among under-15s'.\n found it difficult to comment on the 'who should take action' part of the recommendations as the new government departmental structures were unclear.\n- The general recommendations were seen as a positive way to increase the profile of unintentional injury prevention, although the issue of funding and concerns about the technological infrastructure needed were raised. The injury surveillance recommendations were positively received, as participants pointed to the lack of authoritative evidence as a key problem. There were, however, concerns about the resource implications of carrying out additional data collection and data coordination activities.\n- The introduction of a regulatory framework for home safety equipment was strongly welcomed. However, participants did point to the potential impact on the private sector market – as well as the difficulty of getting private sector landlords to comply. Home safety assessments are offered by a range of different services and some participants welcomed the prospect of a standard, common approach. It was noted that some of these recommendations referred to 'all families with children under 5' and that more clarity was required.\n- Although welcomed in principle, there were concerns about the feasibility of putting the water safety recommendations into practice. For example, lifeguards do not have enough time, hospitality and leisure businesses do not have the skills, and those offering swimming lessons struggle to attract those most in need – even when lessons are free of charge. There was, however, support for a social marketing campaign on water safety.\n- The recommendations on cycle helmet usage were met with some scepticism and there was no consensus on the safety benefits.\n- The recommendations on play were welcomed. In particular, all participants liked the acknowledgement that any risks involved should be balanced with the benefits. However, they felt that it would not be easy to communicate these recommendations to the diverse range of organisations involved.\n- Participants liked the prospect of a national fireworks campaign and the emphasis on evaluation. However, some doubted whether the recommendations would prevent further injuries.\n- The road safety recommendations were generally welcomed as reflecting best practice. Some participants felt that a number of them could be combined. Some welcomed the fact that they could help to get the NHS involved with road safety partnerships.\n- This evidence statement differs from the one in the report submitted to NICE. It has been amended to include findings from one (++) systematic review that was included in the original report and has since been updated. The updated review is: Wilson C, Willis C, Hendrikz JK et al. . Speed cameras for the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths (review). Cochrane Library: 10.# D: Gaps in the evidence\n- The Programme Development Group (PDG) identified a number of gaps in the evidence related to the programmes under examination based on an assessment of the evidence. These gaps are set out below.\n- There is a lack of UK studies evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of legislation, regulation and standards and their enforcement on related outcomes such as compliance, safety, risk taking behaviours and injury. Cost-effectiveness data rarely considers the cost of developing and promoting legislation.\n- Most studies rely on self-reporting to record morbidity outcomes, protective factors and unintended consequences before and after legislation. In addition, baseline data is rarely collected prior to legislative or regulatory change.\n- There is a lack of studies that report specific outcomes for children.\n- There is a lack of UK studies which record and take into account confounding factors that could impact on the effectiveness of legislation, regulation and standards. This includes children and young people's exposure to risk, environmental characteristics and changes in design standards.\n- There is a lack of studies comparing the effectiveness of legislation, regulation and standards across high-, middle- and low-income countries.\n- There is a lack of studies evaluating the impact of mass-media campaigns to support legislation, regulation and standards.\n- There is a lack of good quality qualitative research on the barriers preventing – and facilitators aiding – compliance with legislation, regulation and standards.\n- There is a lack of qualitative and quantitative research on injury prevention in the home.\n- There is a lack of information on the effectiveness of legislation relating to home safety assessments, thermal mixing valves, smoke alarms and window restrictors. Evaluations do not tend to incorporate process and outcome factors.\n- There is a lack of information on how well rules and regulations for different sports are enforced.\n- There is a lack of studies addressing the quantitative correlates of drowning.\n- There is a lack of evaluation of the effectiveness of different types of road signage.\n a lack of studies identifying the factors consistently associated with a reduction in injuries from road crashes.\n- The Group made 18 recommendations for research. These are listed in section 5.# E: Supporting documents\n- Supporting documents are available online.

A variety of menstrual-related traditions exist.  One group of authors has even theorized that menstruation may have played a key role in the development of symbolic culture in early human society.\n\n【1】 # Social Anthropology\n- In hunter-gatherer cultures that do not use contraception (other than breastfeeding), menstruation is quite a rare event and a woman's menstrual status is loudly signalled, so that everyone in the locality knows that this is her 'sacred' or 'special' time. Typically, she must neither cook nor permit marital sex to occur for several days until her period ends. A young woman's menarche is often a time of special celebration and ritual in hunter-gatherer societies.  In some cultures, such as that of the Dogon, women stay in a special hut during their menstrual period.\n- While these restrictions on menstruating women have been interpreted by some as evidence of male sexual dominance in these groups, some authors who interpret these traditions as empowering to women. One example given is Khoisan women in the Kalahari, who are ritually most powerful when menstruating. In her special hut, the 'New Maiden' is thought to be inviolable – having only to snap her fingers to bring down lightning on any disrespectful male. As evidence of the respect given to menstruation, cultural instances of male induced genital bleeding are offered. Such male bleeding is mythically held to be 'stolen' from women, and is practiced on ritual occasions, including in male initiation rites.\n regarded menstruation as a cleansing of the body: compare bloodletting as a major medical treatment of pre-modern times.\n\n【2】 # Mythology\n- Mayan mythology explains the origin of menstruation as a punishment for violating the social rules governing marital alliance. The menstrual blood turns into snakes and insects used in black sorcery, before the Maya moon goddess is reborn from it.\n\n【3】 # The Great Religious Traditions\n\n【4】 ## Abrahamic\n known as the Russian, Ukraine, or Greek Orthodox Church, distinct from the Roman Catholic Church), advise women not to receive communion during their menstrual period.\n- Other denominations follow the rules laid out in the Holiness Code section of Leviticus, somewhat similar to the Jewish ritual of Niddah.\n- The traditional Islamic interpretation of the Qur'an forbids intercourse, but not physical intimacy, during a woman's menstrual period. During menstrual period, women are not required to perform prayers and fasting.\n- Some scholars believe that women are not authorised to enter mosque during this period. And, after the period, a spiritual bath is required to be able to perform prayers, fasting, and to enter the mosque - the same type of bath required of both men and women after sexual intercourse.\n- In Judaism, a ritual exclusion called niddah applies to a woman while menstruating and for about a week thereafter, until she immerses herself in a mikvah (ritual bath). During this time, a married couple must avoid sexual intercourse and physical intimacy. Certain Jewish groups forbid women and men from even touching or passing things to each other during this period. While Orthodox Jews follow this exclusion, many Jews in other branches of the religion do not.\n\n【5】 ## Eastern\n- In Hinduism, a woman having periods cannot be part of religious ceremonies for the first 4 days of the cycle.\n practices in Ayyavazhi society.  However, they did enter the kitchen and bathe on each day of their menses.\n- In Buddhism (Theravada or Hinayana) menstruation is viewed as \"a natural physical excretion that women have to go through on a monthly basis, nothing more or less\". However Hindu belief and practice carried over into Thai buddhist culture. Furthermore some state that some sects of \"Japanese Buddhism, in particular, has been characterised by a persistent anti-feminism\" with menstruating women banned from attending temples.\n\n【6】 ## Sikhism\n- Nānak, the founder of the Sikh faith, condemned the practice of treating women as impure while menstruating.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:12:09"}
{"id": 943034, "user_id": "65e7dd234a08e7753ad36f9f", "user_name": " 黄艳玲", "task_id": 571, "source_info": {"seq_id": "191c8f93-c42a-4cb5-b5e2-c2f89b19d3f6", "title": null, "text": "【0】 - Nursing shortage\n- Nursing shortage refers to a situation where the demand for nurses is greater than the supply.\n- The total number of nurses working in the healthcare field in the United States has decreased from 2,669,603 in the year 2000 to 2,262,020 in year 2001. The amount of nursing responsibilities has increased and the patients are more ill than before. In addition, the average age of nurses increases while the number of applications to baccalaureate programs has decreased. Furthermore, new opportunities became available for the nursing practice, which further drains the number of nurses available for the acute care settings. Other factors that affect the nursing shortage are aging workforce, problems with retention, and difficulty recruiting young people into the field.\n\n【1】 # Job satisfaction\n- Studies have shown that the nursing shortage is an issue in developed countries today.   students need now apply to schools to become nurses because admission rates have increased.   Several studies have been done to understand how nurses feel about their career.  About 20 years ago, sociologist Bryan Turner initially identified nurses’ most important complaints as subordination to the medical profession as well as over regulation, and difficult working conditions. Also, a report from the Commonwealth of Australia identified some of the dissatisfaction as stemming from frequent schedule changes, overloads, shift work, lack of appreciation by superiors and colleagues, as well as lack of childcare. Inadequate pay was identified as a lesser problem based on the report. Later, a study revealed that the dissatisfaction among nurses focused on conflicting expectations from nurses and managers due to regulation of cost, lack of opportunity to provide comprehensive nursing care, and disillusioned workforce or “loss of confidence in, and frustration with, the healthcare system.” Limitations to comprehensive care were identified because nurses are overloaded with the number of assigned patients, massive paperwork for billing purposes, and short staffing to cut cost.\n- In the past 20 years administrative/government policies and practice has changed very little, cost-cutting is still the priority, patient loads uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending changes.  The major reason why nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of the working conditions.  With the high turnover rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff.  Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the real problem is “nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation.” There’s a decline in interest among college students to consider nursing as a probable career. More than half of currently working nurses “would not recommend nursing to their own children” and a little less than a quarter would advise others to avoid this as a profession all together.\n\n【2】 # Nursing shortage impact\n- Nursing shortage has the following effects:\n- Increase nurses’ patient’s loads\n- Increases the risk for error\n- Increase risk of spreading infection to patients and staffs\n- Increase risk for occupational injury\n- Increased deaths\n- Increase in nursing turnover\n- Increase perception of unsafe working conditions, contributing to increase shortage, and hindering local or national recruitment efforts\n- Increase the nurses chance of getting psychiatric help because of massive amounts of stress\n- The negative impact mentioned above intensifies with the nursing shortage in developing countries due to recruitment to work abroad to wealthier countries.  For example, nurses from the Philippines and Africa are recruited to work for the United States and Europe.\n\n【3】 # Patching up the shortage\n- Nursing shortages can be consistent or intermittent depending on the current number of patient needing medical attention. In order to respond to this fluctuating  census, health care industries have utilized float pool nurses and agency nurses. Float pool nurses are nursing staffs employed by the hospital to work in any unit within the organization. Agency nurses are employed by an independent staffing organization and have the opportunity to work in any hospitals on a daily, weekly or contractual basis. Similar to other professionals, both types of nurses can only work within their licensed scope of practice, training, and certification.\n- Float pool nurses and agency nurses, as mentioned by First Consulting group, are currently used in response to the current shortage. Use of the said services increases the cost of healthcare, decreases specialty, and decreases the interest in long-term solutions to the shortage. On the other hand, international recruitment gives rise to concerns on clinical competencies, cultural sensitivity, and ethics in global recruitment.\n- A growing response to the nursing shortage is the advent of travel nursing a specialized sub-set of the staffing agency industry that has evolved to serve the needs of hospitals effected by the increasing nursing shortage. There are an estimated 25,500 Registered Nurse Travelers working in the U.S. The number of LVN/LPN Nurse Travelers is not known.\n\n【4】 # Retention and recruitment\n- Retention and recruitment are important responses to a long-term solution to the nursing shortage. Some of the reasons that contribute to retention of nursing in the healthcare field are addressed in different levels and are as follows. In spite of the discontent, nurses continue to practice. Also, there is a co-relation of high job satisfaction and significant education activities among nurses. Other possible solutions is through incentives and funding coupled with employer and hospital regulatory approach to retain the current number of staff and could help avoid aggravating turnover.\n- To assist the healthcare field, congress annually approves a budget for the year through the Nurse Reinvestment Act passed in 2002. Previously in 2004 and 2005, 141.9 million and 205 million were approved in each fiscal year, respectively. The funding is distributed to advance nursing education, scholarships, grants, diversity programs, loan repayment programs, nursing faculty programs, and comprehensive geriatric education.\n- Efforts of some states to address the nursing shortage in United States focused on the nursing working conditions. Currently, mandatory overtime for nurses is prohibited in nine states, hospital accountability to implement valid staffing plans in seven states, and only one state implement the minimum staffing ratio.\n- In terms of recruitment, suggestions were made in order make nursing attractive as a profession. One of these suggestions was presenting Nursing as a unique discipline, making it an attractive field for the young people.  As mentioned in retention, incentives and funding to recruitment effort can contribute to the solution.\n- Many hospitals believe retention is more important than recruitment. They feel that if you treat an employee well, they will be your best recruiters. Word of mouth goes far.\n\n【5】 # Market philosophy and Impacts on healthcare\n viewed as consumers.  Therefore, only clinical responsibilities, such as medication administration, dressing changes, foley catheter insertions, and anything that involves tangible supplies, are quantified and incorporated into the organizational budget and plan of care for the consumers.\n\n【6】 # US nursing shortage\n- The US population is projected to grow at least 18% over two decades in the 21st century, while the population of those sixty-five and older is expected to increase three times that rate.  The current shortfall of nurses is projected at over 1 million by the year 2020.\n- Professional and related occupations are expected to rapidly increase between years 2000 – 2012. The demand for healthcare practitioners and technical occupations will increase and projected to have 1.7 million job openings with in this time period. In this group, the demand for registered nurses is the highest. Registered nurses are predicted to have a total of 1,101 openings due to growth during this 10 year period.  In a 2001 American Hospital Association survey, 715 hospitals reported that 126,000 nursing positions were unfilled.\n decreased. Wage among nurses leveled as it relates to inflation between 1990 and 1994.\n- Comparing the data released by the Bureau of Health Professions, the projections of shortage in within two years have increased.\n- Source: Data from the Bureau of Health Professions \n- Source: Data from the Bureau of Health Professions. .\n\n【7】 # Global shortage and recruitment\n- The nursing shortage is in global scale according to the International Council of Nurses: Netherlands needed to fill 7000 nursing positions in year 2002, England needs to fill 22,000 positions in year 2000, and Canada will need about 10,000 nursing graduates by year 2011.\n- In the United States, recruiting foreign nurses has been practiced for 50 years. Philippines supplied most of its nurses to the United States and other countries. Overall, the total number of foreign graduate nurses continues to increase to 14% between 1998 and 2003.\n- U.S. healthcare facilities pushes to “ease restrictions” on the immigration law to increase the number of recruited foreign nurses. On the other hand, this recruitment practice is only a temporary solution and does not fully address the nursing shortage as mentioned by American Nursing Association (ANA).\n\n【8】 # Impact of global recruitment\n- Countries that send their nurses abroad experience a shortage and strain their own healthcare system. In South Africa, accelerated recruitment by developed countries such as United States, United Kingdom and Australia is putting more strain in the healthcare system due to prevalence of diseases, such as AIDS, and limited resources.  Similar to the U.S., nurses who leave the organization are a financial disadvantage due to the need to fund recruiting and retraining of new nurses into the system. Also, every nurse that leaves the country in South Africa is an annual loss of $184,000, related to the financial and economical impact of the nursing shortage. The following represents the number of nurses per 100,000-population in South African Countries.\n- In addition, physicians in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for export opportunities.\n- In an American Hospital Association study, the cost to replace one nurse in the U. S. was estimated at around $30,000 - $64,000.  This amount is likely related to the cost of recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in a long run because foreign nurses have a contractual obligation to complete their term.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语意重复#6#6#Source: Data from the Bureau of Health Professions", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:05:04"}

Patients should have either received prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Trastuzumab emtansine is recommended only if the company provides it with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.\n\n【3】 # The technology\n- Description of the technology\n- Trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla; Roche) is an antibody‑drug conjugate consisting of trastuzumab linked to maytansine, which is a cytotoxic agent. Because the antibody targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER, and HER2 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells, the conjugate delivers the toxin directly to the cancer cells.\n- Marketing authorisation\n- Trastuzumab emtansine, as a single agent, has a UK marketing authorisation 'for the treatment of adult patients with HER2‑positive, unreseclocally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either:\n- received prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease or\n- developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy'.\n- Adverse reactions\n- The summary of product characteristics includes the following adverse reactions for trastuzumab emtansine: increase in serum transaminases, left ventricular dysfunction, infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, decreased platelet counts, an immune response to trastuzumab emtansine, and reactions secondary to the accidental administration of trastuzumab emtansine around infusion sites. For full details of adverse reactions and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics.\n- Recommended dose and schedule\n- Trastuzumab emtansine is administered as an intravenous infusion. The recommended dose is 3.6 mg/kg bodyweight every 3 weeks (21‑day cycle). Patients should have treatment until the disease progresses or unacceptoxicity occurs.\n- Price\n- The list price for trastuzumab emtansine is £1,641.01 for a 100‑mg vial and £2,625.62 for a 160‑mg vial (excluding VAT, British national formulary online, accessed February . The company estimates that the average cost of a course of treatment is £91,614, using the list price, and based on a 3‑weekly dose of 3.6 mg/kg, a patient weight of 70.1 kg and an average length of treatment of 14.5 months.\n- The pricing arrangement considered during guidance development was one in which Roche had agreed a complex patient access scheme with the Department of Health. In October 2017 Roche agreed a simple discount patient access scheme with the Department of Health. The discount to the list price is applied at the point of purchase or invoice. The level of the discount is commercial in confidence. The Department of Health considered that this patient access scheme does not constitute an excessive administrative burden on the NHS.# Evidence\n considered the updated cost-effectiveness analyses submitted by Roche after consultation and their critique by the ERG.\n Both trials were international, open-label trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. EMILIA compared trastuzumab emtansine with lapatinib plus capecitabine, and TH3RESA compared it with the clinician's choice of treatment.

The new evidence included additional follow-up data from EMILIA, which was used to model overall survival. New cost-effectiveness analyses were done using a complex patient access scheme. The patient access scheme considered by the committee was subsequently replaced by a commercial access agreement between Roche and NHS England.

The committee recognised that patients value the availability of more treatment options and that trastuzumab emtansine would be welcomed by patients and their families.\n- The committee discussed with the clinical experts the current clinical management of HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer. It was aware that NICE recommends trastuzumab plus paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for people who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and in whom anthracycline treatment is inappropriate . After disease progression, NICE recommends second- and third-line treatment with non-targeted therapies such as capecitabine or vinorelbine, which can be combined with continued trastuzumab therapy if disease progression is within the central nervous system alone . The committee heard from the clinical experts that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy has become the standard first-line treatment in clinical practice, but more recently in England patients may receive pertuzumab in addition to trastuzumab and docetaxel, which is funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund. It further heard that after disease progression on trastuzumab (that is, in the second-line setting) clinical practice varies, but most patients will continue trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (capecitabine or vinorelbine) or receive lapatinib plus capecitabine. The committee noted that continued trastuzumab therapy was not offered by all cancer centres, and that lapatinib plus capecitabine was available in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee heard from the clinical experts that contrary to NICE guidance, single-agent chemotherapy (for example, capecitabine or vinorelbine) is not routinely used for patients whose disease progressed on first-line treatment. The committee concluded that local access to treatments and the availability of treatments through the Cancer Drugs Fund led to some variation in clinical practice so that no single pathway of care could be defined.\n- The committee considered the likely position of trastuzumab emtansine in the treatment pathway of HER2‑positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and the key comparators for trastuzumab emtansine in clinical practice. It noted that the clinical experts expect that trastuzumab emtansine would be used as second-line therapy (that is, instead of continued trastuzumab plus chemotherapy or lapatinib plus capecitabine) because trastuzumab emtansine has been shown to be more clinically effective than the alternative second‑line agent, lapatinib plus capecitabine, in EMILIA. The committee concluded that based on current clinical practice, trastuzumab plus capecitabine, trastuzumab plus vinorelbine and lapatinib plus capecitabine were relevant comparators at this stage of the disease.\n- The committee discussed which sources of trial data were appropriate for the second-line setting, in which trastuzumab emtansine is likely to be used. The committee was aware that 36% of patients in EMILIA and 0% of patients in TH3RESA received trastuzumab emtansine as second-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Given these proportions, the committee concluded that EMILIA was the most relevant source of clinical evidence for its decision-making in this appraisal.\n- The committee discussed whether the results from EMILIA were generalisable to clinical practice, noting that patients in England may receive pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel in the first-line setting. It heard from the company that 9.5% of patients in EMILIA had previously received pertuzumab therapy (10.3% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group, 8.7% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group) but the committee considered this proportion too small to determine whether the effect of trastuzumab emtansine differed in patients who had previously received pertuzumab. In addition, the committee heard from the clinical experts that there was no evidence on whether or not pertuzumab can modify the effect of subsequent treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. However, the clinical experts indicated that trastuzumab emtansine demonstrated a clinical benefit after trastuzumab, and that trastuzumab and pertuzumab have similar mechanisms of action, so the effect of trastuzumab emtansine would not be expected to differ after trastuzumab or after pertuzumab plus trastuzumab. The committee concluded that it was currently unknown whether previous pertuzumab would alter the clinical effectiveness of subsequent treatment with trastuzumab emtansine, but there was no positive evidence that this was the case.\n noted the evidence review group's (ERG's) concern that none of the patients in EMILIA had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, whereas in clinical practice around one third of patients would have an ECOG performance status of 2. The committee appreciated that patients enrolled in clinical trials may be younger and with better performance status than those in routine clinical practice, and so might have better outcomes. The committee agreed that the population in EMILIA was otherwise reasonably representative of patients in the UK. It concluded that the results of EMILIA were suifor assessing the clinical effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine in clinical practice.\n- The committee considered the clinical effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine as a second-line treatment. It was aware that in EMILIA, patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group had improved survival compared with patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group, irrespective of the line of therapy. However, the committee noted that subgroup analyses suggested a lesser benefit in patients who received second‑line treatment (in whom the difference in effect was not statistically significant) than in the overall population. The committee was aware that the analysis may not have been powered to show a difference in treatment effect in the subgroup. In addition, the committee heard from the clinical experts that there is no biologically plausible reason for the effect to differ according to the number of previous treatments patients had received. The committee concluded that the subgroup analysis was not reliable enough to inform a decision about the clinical effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine as a second-line treatment.\n heard from the company that the most common adverse event that resulted in patients stopping trastuzumab emtansine was a decreased platelet count (2% of patients). The committee concluded that trastuzumab emtansine had been shown to have a satisfactory adverse event profile in EMILIA.\n- The committee considered the Bayesian mixed treatment comparison used by the company to estimate hazard ratios for trastuzumab emtansine relative to the comparators for which no head-to-head evidence existed. The committee agreed that CEREBEL, an open-label trial comparing the incidence of central nervous system metastases in patients with HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine or trastuzumab plus capecitabine, and the study by Martin et al. , should be included in the base-case analysis to use all available evidence and that the ERG's random effects model would better reflect the heterogeneity between the trials than the company's fixed effect model.\n\n【5】 # Costeffectiveness( NICEtechnologyappraisalguidance\n- The committee considered the company's economic model used to estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine and how it captured the main aspects of the condition. It noted that the company used a 3‑state model and chose a time horizon of 10 years for its base case. The committee agreed that the model structure was consistent with other models used for the same disease. The committee noted that the ERG preferred a 15‑year time horizon because a small proportion of patients were still alive at 10 years and data for these patients would not be included in a model with a 10‑year horizon. The committee agreed that in principle a lifetime time horizon should be used to capture all long-term costs and health effects. It concluded that the company's model was appropriate to estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine, but that a 15‑year time horizon should be used.\n- The committee considered the utility values used in the company's model. It noted that in the progression-free state, the company applied a higher utility value for trastuzumab emtansine than for its comparators. The company considered that the favourable side effect profile of trastuzumab emtansine supports using a distinct utility value for trastuzumab emtansine. The committee questioned whether utility values should differ for each treatment because the clinical experts indicated that most adverse events resolve within a few weeks, whereas in the model the utility values were applied throughout the entire progression-free state. In addition, the committee considered that applying a higher utility value for trastuzumab emtansine could result in treatment benefit being double-counted and overestimated, because the utility decrements for adverse events already capture part of this benefit. In response to the appraisal consultation document for NICE technology appraisal guidance 371, the company clarified that the utility decrements for adverse events were not applied separately in the model, but were incorporated into the utility values in the progression-free state, and therefore were applied only once. The committee heard from the ERG that, although the modelling of adverse events had limitations, the benefit of trastuzumab emtansine from reducing adverse events was not double-counted in the model. The committee acknowledged the additional evidence submitted by the company in response to the appraisal consultation document. It noted that the evidence suggested that in EMILIA, patients who received trastuzumab emtansine felt better and reported being less troubled by side effects than those who received lapatinib plus capecitabine. The committee was aware that EMILIA was an open-label trial, which may have introduced bias in the outcomes reported by patients, but noted the additional evidence on wellbeing and side effects presented by the company. The committee concluded that a marginally higher utility value for trastuzumab emtansine in the progression-free state could be accepted in this appraisal.\n- The committee noted that in its cost-effectiveness analysis, the company assumed clinical equivalence between capecitabine and vinorelbine, and between trastuzumab plus capecitabine and trastuzumab plus vinorelbine. The committee discussed with the clinical experts whether this assumption was clinically plausible. The clinical experts indicated that any chemotherapy would produce additional benefit when combined with trastuzumab. They stated that the precise clinical difference between capecitabine and vinorelbine had not been established in clinical trials, although in their opinion it would be reasonable to assume no difference. The committee concluded that, although it would be preferable to base the comparison on data from well-conducted clinical trials, the assumption of no difference between capecitabine- and vinorelbine-based regimens in the model could be justified for this appraisal.\n- The committee considered the adverse events associated with trastuzumab emtansine in relation to the economic modelling. It noted that the model incorporated utility decrements for only 3 adverse events and costs for 2 adverse events. The committee was concerned that this did not capture many adverse events associated with trastuzumab emtansine, including decreased platelet counts. The committee was aware that when the ERG included the costs of the adverse events that occurred frequently in EMILIA, this had little impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates. However, it concluded that the model should have incorporated both the decrease in utility and the increased costs associated with adverse events.\n\n【6】  agreed that the analysis should use a 15‑year time horizon and incorporate the decrease in utility and increased costs associated with treating adverse events. The committee noted that in both the company's and ERG's base case, trastuzumab plus capecitabine and trastuzumab plus vinorelbine were more costly and less effective than lapatinib plus capecitabine (that is, they were dominated). The company's base-case ICER for trastuzumab emtansine compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine was £167,200 per QALY gained. The committee noted that the ERG's base-case ICER was very similar at £166,400 per QALY gained. At its first meeting, the committee agreed that the most plausible ICER was above the ICER range that would normally be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n- At its second meeting, the committee considered the revised cost-effectiveness results incorporating the patient access scheme submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document (which are commercial in confidence). It expressed disappointment that the patient access scheme did not reduce the ICER to a level close to one that could be accepted as a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee concluded that the size of the discount in the patient access scheme meant that it was still unable to recommend trastuzumab emtansine for treating HER2‑positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after trastuzumab and a taxane.\n noted that trastuzumab emtansine prolonged survival, with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine. However, the committee considered that all benefits of a substantial nature relating to treatment with trastuzumab emtansine had been captured in the QALY calculation, including the favourable adverse event profile and increased progression-free and overall survival.\n- The committee considered supplementary advice from NICE that should be taken into account when appraising treatments that may extend the life of patients with a short life expectancy and that are licensed for indications that affect small numbers of people with incurable illnesses. For this advice to be applied, all the following criteria must be met.\n- The treatment is indicated for patients with a short life expectancy, normally less than 24 months.\n- There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the treatment offers an extension to life, normally of at least an additional 3 months, compared with current NHS treatment.\n\n【7】  accepted that trastuzumab emtansine fulfilled the other 2 end-of-life criteria, namely a small patient population (approximately 1, and a survival gain of at least 3 months. The committee therefore concluded that trastuzumab emtansine fulfilled the criteria for end-of-life consideration.\n- Based on the considerations in section 4.19, the committee discussed whether trastuzumab emtansine represents a cost-effective use of NHS resources. It agreed that, even taking into account additional weights applied to QALY benefits for a life-extending treatment at the end of life, the ICER incorporating the patient access scheme remained well above the range that could be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee concluded that trastuzumab emtansine could not be recommended for treating HER2-positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.\n\n【8】 # Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme( PPRS)\n noted the ABPI comment that: 'Indeed, any other interpretation may increase the risk of legal challenge from other companies'. The committee was, however, aware that the company continued to believe that it was 'unfair to disregard the consideration of PPRS payments within the appraisal process' and was 'deeply disappointed' by the conclusion of the position statement. Company representatives at the meeting stated that the company's opinion was that the NICE position statement should state that 'the 2014 PPRS payment mechanism should, as a matter of course, be regarded as a relevant consideration in its assessment of the cost effectiveness of branded medicines', and that it should apply to all technology appraisals, not just to the appraisal of trastuzumab emtansine. The committee concluded that the 2 sole negotiators for the PPRS, that is the Department of the Health and the ABPI, fully supported the NICE position statement, but that the company disagreed with it.\n recalled paragraph 6.2.14 of the guide, which states that: 'The potential budget impact of the adoption of a new technology does not determine the appraisal committee's decision'. The committee concluded that it was not responsible for devising new methods for estimating cost effectiveness and, further, it had neither the remit nor the expertise to do so. Furthermore, it understood that the position statement had been issued as guidance to all NICE technology appraisal committees to ensure consistency of decision-making. It therefore took the view that the NICE position statement should not be disregarded without clear and coherent reasons for doing so.\n by other companies who have joined the 2014 PPRS, and would have to contribute a larger share to the rebate based on how much the allowed spend was exceeded because of trastuzumab emtansine prescribing. The committee concluded that, as it stands, the 2014 PPRS does not remove the opportunity cost from funding treatments that are not considered to be cost effective according to the normal methods of technology appraisals, and that the precise and full costs of introducing a new technology into the NHS were not covered or rebated through the PPRS.\n\n【9】 - The committee discussed the company's proposal that the committee issues positive guidance on trastuzumab emtansine conditional on the following:\n- The company remains within the 2014 PPRS scheme.\n- The spend level within the 2014 PPRS scheme remains above the agreed growth levels.\n responsible for the 2014 PPRS. The committee noted that the company could have used this mechanism to apply a price discount in line with what it believed would be the true cost of trastuzumab emtansine to the NHS, in the context of the 2014 PPRS. Accepting the company's proposal would, therefore, transcend the existing framework. In summary, the committee was not satisfied that the company's proposal demonstrated that the impact of the PPRS rebate could be traced back to the opportunity cost of trastuzumab emtansine within the existing NICE guide to the methods of technology appraisal , and NICE's statutory functions. Because of this, the committee concluded that the company's proposal did not represent an exception that might lead it to depart from the general position in the NICE statement.\n- In conclusion, the committee did not hear anything that it could consider to be reasonable grounds to disregard the NICE position statement in this appraisal. The committee agreed that it may consider the 2014 PPRS if specific proposals are put forward, if these fit within the methods and processes of technology appraisal and are consistent with NICE's statutory functions. However, it did not consider that such proposals had been put forward in this appraisal. Therefore, the committee concluded that the 2014 PPRS did not affect its previous recommendations about trastuzumab emtansine.\n\n【10】 # Cancer Drugs Fundreconsideration\n- This appraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab emtansine for treating HER2‑positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane. In its revised submission, the company included:\n- an additional 2 years' follow-up data from EMILIA, which was used to model overall survival\n- a complex patient access scheme in which the NHS would pay for trastuzumab emtansine up to the first 14 months of treatment for each patient, and the company would pay for trastuzumab emtansine for any patients remaining on treatment beyond 14 months (which was subsequently amended after the first committee meeting) and\n- an updated model incorporating new data and using some of the committee's preferred assumptions :\n- extending the model time horizon from 10 to 15 years\n- incorporating the follow-up costs of left ventricular ejection fraction monitoring\n- correcting the utility values for adverse events (although the ERG suggested that these may still be incorrect)\n- using the actual dose of trastuzumab emtansine and lapatinib plus capecitabine rather than the planned dose\n- revising the parameters for the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and\n- estimating the post-progression treatment costs.\n\n【11】 # Clinicalmanagementof HER2‑positiveadvancedbreastcancer\n applies to the combination therapies, trastuzumab plus capecitabine and lapatinib plus capecitabine. People whose disease responds well to trastuzumab emtansine have improved quality of life as well as longer life. The clinical experts noted that they can assess whether trastuzumab emtansine is effective or limited by toxicity within 3 cycles. Treatment normally continues until disease progression. The clinical experts stated that the next line of treatment after trastuzumab emtansine would depend on the person's treatment history, but options were limited at this stage, and often this would be palliative care.\n\n【12】 ## Patient experience\n emphasised that trastuzumab emtansine has helped them to live their lives fully and continue working, 2 factors that are very important and highly valued by patients, especially because many are relatively young women with caring responsibilities. They stated that if the drug were not available there would be no other suitreatments for them.\n- The committee acknowledged the comments from patients after consultation, in particular that 115,000 people have signed a Breast Cancer Now petition urging NICE and Roche to ensure that trastuzumab emtansine remains available for patients in England. The committee appreciated how important it is for effective treatments for breast cancer to be available, but noted that its role was to consider the clinical and cost effectiveness of this technology at the price set by the company (including any nationally agreed access arrangements). Nevertheless, the committee acknowledged that it was relevant that the treatment had been provided to patients in the NHS in England for 3 years so that patients and clinicians would view a negative recommendation as 'taking away' an existing NHS funded treatment. Although it could be argued that the opportunity cost issues are not the same for a previously funded drug as for one that requires new NHS investment, the NICE methods guide does not have any specific mechanisms or advice which apply to this situation.\n\n【13】 ## Comparators\n noted that based on the results of the network meta-analysis, trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed similar clinical effectiveness to lapatinib plus capecitabine. Overall the committee concluded that based on what it had heard from experts at the committee meeting and in light of the consultation comments, trastuzumab plus capecitabine is the most relevant comparator.\n\n【14】 ## The company's revised economic model\n considered the ERG's exploratory analyses. It acknowledged that the final version of the model from the company took into account the ERG's concerns about the plausibility of the methods used in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis in the model. The company:\n- used patient-level data to calculate vial use\n- excluded an additional adjustment for wastage\n- updated the patient access scheme and\n tested alternative prior distributions to determine the sensitivity of the economic model. As a result, the cost-effectiveness results presented by the company and the ERG were very similar.\n\n【15】 ## Calculation of treatment costs\n used patient-level data to calculate vial use after a request from the ERG. The committee noted that using patient-level data increased the ICER compared with the company's base case, but it recognised that this did not account for dose reductions or treatment breaks. The committee heard that there is vial sharing in oncology centres that have centralised intravenous drug preparation. This reduces the amount of wastage, but cannot stop it completely. The committee noted that the company's revised economic model assumed no wastage because it used patient-level data to calculate vial use, although the previous version of the model assumed that 50% of any drug remaining in a vial after the dose is drawn up is re-used and 50% is wasted. The committee concluded that some wastage needs to be included in the calculation of trastuzumab emtansine treatment costs, because assuming no wastage is not plausible.\n\n【16】 ## End-of-life considerations\n considered the evidence submitted by the company for life expectancy with trastuzumab plus capecitabine. It heard from the company that there are limited data available on the life expectancy of patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab with capecitabine as second-line treatment. However, data from the CEREBEL study  suggests that it is likely to be around 24 months. The committee took into account that patients with metastatic disease who are eligible for trastuzumab emtansine had already progressed on first-line therapy and were in the advanced stages of the disease. Therefore the committee agreed to uphold the end-of-life decision from the original appraisal. It was aware that it was now looking at a different comparator from the one on which the original decision had been made (lapatinib plus capecitabine), but judged that any difference in survival between lapatinib plus capecitabine and trastuzumab and capecitabine was likely to be marginal, taking into account the results of the network meta-analysis . The committee therefore concluded that trastuzumab emtansine fulfilled the criteria for a life-extending, end-of-life treatment for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.\n\n【17】 ## Conclusions\n- The committee noted that the updated evidence available since the original appraisal confirms that trastuzumab emtansine is clinically effective, with a statistically significant survival benefit compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine. Despite only indirect evidence of its effectiveness compared with trastuzumab plus capecitabine, there was no reason to consider that the relative benefits would not be comparable. Based on what the committee heard from experts at the committee meeting and in light of the consultation comments, it concluded that trastuzumab plus capecitabine is the most relevant comparator. Based on the clinical and cost-effectiveness analyses, including the updated complex patient access scheme, the most plausible ICER for trastuzumab emtansine compared with trastuzumab plus capecitabine was within the range that would normally be considered cost effective if the end-of-life criteria apply. The committee therefore concluded that trastuzumab emtansine could be recommended for use in the NHS for treating HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.\n\n【18】 # Summary of appraisal committee's key conclusions\n- TA458\n- Appraisal title: Trastuzumab emtansine for treating HER2‑positive advanced breast cancer after trastuzumab and a taxane\n- - Key conclusion (Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of TA\n- Trastuzumab emtansine is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER‑positive, unresec, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in adults who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either received prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Trastuzumab emtansine is recommended only if the company provides it in line with the commercial access agreement with NHS England.\n- The updated evidence available since the original appraisal confirms that trastuzumab emtansine is clinically effective, with a statistically significant survival benefit compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine. Despite only indirect evidence of its effectiveness compared with trastuzumab plus capecitabine, there was no reason to consider that the benefits would not be comparable. Based on the clinical and cost-effectiveness analyses, including an updated complex patient access scheme (that was subsequently replaced by a commercial access agreement), the most plausible ICER for trastuzumab emtansine compared with trastuzumab plus capecitabine was within the range that would normally be considered cost effective if the end-of-life criteria apply.\n- Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of TA371\n- The company's revised submission included:\n- an additional 2 years follow-up data from EMILIA, which was used to model overall survival and\n- a complex patient access scheme.\n- After consultation an updated model was submitted, in which the company:\n- used patient-level data to calculate vial use\n- excluded an additional adjustment for wastage and\n- updated the patient access scheme and\n- updated the probabilistic sensitivity analysis in line with the ERG's suggestions.\n- The committee considered that based on what it heard from experts at the committee meeting and in light of the consultation comments, trastuzumab plus capecitabine is the only relevant comparator.\n considered the evidence submitted by the company for life expectancy with trastuzumab plus capecitabine.

The committee took into account that patients with metastatic disease eligible for trastuzumab emtansine had already progressed on first-line therapy, and were in the advanced stages of the disease.

Even without the drug, colon cancer is fairly rare, maybe 1 in 3,000 in every 5 year period. The NNT for a 5-year treatment with the drug is therefore 6,000: by treating 6,000 people with the drug, one can expect to reduce the number of colon cancer cases from 2 to 1.\n- In general, NNT is always computed with respect to two treatments A and B, with A typically a drug and B a placebo (in our example above, A is a 5-year treatment with the hypothetical drug, and B is no treatment). A defined endpoint has to be specified (in our example: the appearance of colon cancer in the 5 year period). If the probabilities pA and pB of this endpoint under treatments A and B, respectively, are known, then the NNT is computed as 1/(pB-pA).\n- The NNT is an important measure in pharmacoeconomics. If a clinical endpoint is devastating enough (e.g. death, heart attack), drugs with a high NNT may still be indicated in particular situations. If the endpoint is minor, health insurers may decline to reimburse drugs with a high NNT.\n\n【4】 # Worked Example\n\n【5】 # Variations\n\n【6】 # Number Neededto Screen\n- In  screening, the number needed to screen (NNS) is the number of patients who must be screened for one patient to benefit.

It differs from stanozolol by having a furazan ring system in place of the pyrazole. It has a c-17alpha methyl group, which allows it to be taken orally and causes heptatoxicity in some individuals.  The more intriguing characteristic of this steroid is that (unlike other anabolic steroids) furazabol has the ability to lower cholesterol levels.\n- According to William Llewellyn, author of  Anabolics 2007, the cholesterol-lowering effects of Furazabol are a myth. In the 1970s, research studies showed that Furazabol along with many other orally-active AAS like Anavar (oxandrolone) lowered total serum cholesterol. It was subsequently established that the cholesterol reduction from oral AAS was the result of suppressed HDL levels. As such, it would be expected that Furazabol, like other oral anabolic steroids, while reducing total cholesterol levels would still adversely affect the HDL/LDL ratio and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- Diversion of this obscure pharmaceutical steroid to the black market rarely occurred while it was being manufactured by Daiichi Seiyaku Company in Japan. However, a number of underground labs (UGL) have produced limited quantities of Furazabol in recent years.

This may reduce the frequency of graft occlusion and may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality.\n- The MiraQ system can lead to an estimated cost saving of £80.27 per person compared with clinical assessment. # The technology\n\n【3】 # Description of the technology\n- The MiraQ cardiac system (MCQ0, Medistim ASA) uses ultrasound for the non-invasive assessment of graft blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is intended for use in patients with coronary artery disease who are having CABG surgery. It measures 3 parameters of transit time flow (mean blood flow in ml/minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage) to assess graft blood flow and check patency.\n- The MiraQ system measures transit time volume flow using specially designed probes. A microcomputer with a 19‑inch touch screen mounted on a moveable trolley is used to control the probes and store their outputs.\n- The MiraQ system can use 2 types of probes to assess blood flow during CABG procedures (the PS and PQ). These differ in the number of recommended reuses and their method of sterilisation. Only the PS probe is considered in this guidance, because the PQ probe needs ethylene oxide sterilisation, which is not thought to be widely available in the NHS. The probes deliver a bidirectional ultrasound beam across a target vessel and the system analyses the returning signal to calculate the blood flow through the vessel at a default filter setting of 20 Hz. A real-time flow curve is displayed together with the mean blood flow in ml/minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage. This information can be used to determine whether flow through the graft and its anastomoses is accep If not, then the graft can be explored to detect imperfections and revised as necessary to achieve accepblood flow.\n- The cost of the MiraQ system stated in the sponsor's submission includes £32,000 for the VeriQ 2011 console, and £1,582 for each PS probe. These costs were updated in the 2017 revision of the cost model to £34,000 for the cardiac MCQ0 console and £1,481 for each probe.  These costs were updated again in the 2021 revision of the cost model, because the MiraQ console and PS probe increased in price to £35,955 and £1,720, respectively. The annual maintenance cost (assuming a 10‑year life span) reduced from £1,800 to £1,369.80.\n- The claimed benefits of the MiraQ system in the case for adoption presented by the manufacturer are:\n- improved outcomes of revascularisation procedures by reducing the risk of early graft failure and adverse events\n- reduced hospital stay for some patients by reducing the incidence of complications during and after surgery\n- reduced numbers of repeat procedures and treatments for postoperative complications.\n\n【4】 # Current management\n- Coronary artery disease is a common cause of symptoms, disability and death. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to stenosis or occlusion of the coronary arteries. NICE's guideline on sangina recommends that revascularisation of the blocked coronary arteries using CABG or percutaneous coronary interventions should be considered in people whose symptoms are not satisfactorily controlled by medical treatment.\n used.\n- Cardiac surgeons use a variety of techniques to avoid technical imperfections during CABG, but assessment of graft flow is usually subjective. Techniques used vary according to the graft used, the surgical technique, and the surgeon's individual preference. They include the surgeon assessing resistance and perfusion beyond a graft by flushing fluid through it before restoring flow, and both observing and palpating grafts for pulsation when blood flow has been re-established.\n- There are a number of methods for the objective assessment of the technical results and of blood flow. Transoesophageal echocardiography evaluates heart function after bypass by assessing regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which can be compared with preoperative regional left ventricular function. Perioperative graft flow can be visualised in the operating theatre using conventional angiography or using indocyanine green fluorescence. NICE has produced interventional procedures guidance on intraoperative fluorescence angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft. This guidance states that current evidence suggests that the procedure is safe enough for routine use in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency.# Clinical evidence\n\n【5】 # Summary of clinical evidence\n- The key clinical outcomes for the MiraQ system presented in the decision problem were:\n- incidence of graft failure\n- time to graft failure\n- peri and postoperative clinical events associated with graft failure (including mortality)\n- frequency of the need for graft revision and changes in VeriQ measurements afterwards\n- the need for repeat coronary revascularisation procedures\n- long-term morbidity and mortality.\n- The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the MiraQ system was based on 2 retrospective observational studies that examined surgical outcomes, and one comparative study that compared parameter values from the VeriQ system against another flowmeter. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe and Canada; there were none in the UK. All patients in the studies were treated by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n- In a retrospective case study in Canada, Kieser et al.  evaluated transit time flow measurement with the VeriQ system to detect technical errors in CABGs intra-operatively and to predict postoperative major adverse cardiac events. They assessed 1,000 arterial grafts in 336 consecutive patients. Three parameters of transit time flow (pulsatility index, flow and diastolic filling percentage) were measured in 990 (99%) of the grafts. A pulsatility index value of less than 5 was chosen as the principal measure of graft adequacy. In 82% of the patients (277 of , 93% of grafts (916 of  had a pulsatility index of less than or equal to 5. The remaining 74 (7%) grafts (in 59 patients, 18%) had a pulsatility index of greater than 5, but grafts were revised only when an abnormally high pulsatility index was accompanied by other indications of graft malfunction (abnormal electrocardiogram  changes, regional wall motion abnormality on transoesophageal echocardiography or haemodynamic compromise). On this basis, 20 grafts (in 14 patients, 4%) that were suspected to be problematic were revised.\n- For analysis of the findings, patients were divided into 2 groups: the 277 (82%) with at least one graft with a pulsatility index of less than 5, and 59 (18%) with at least one graft with a pulsatility index of greater than 5. Major adverse cardiac events (recurrent angina, perioperative myocardial infarction, postoperative angioplasty, re‑operation and/or perioperative death) occurred significantly more often in patients with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (10 of 59, 17%) when compared with patients with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (15 of 277, 5.4%, p=0 Mortality following non-emergency surgery was significantly higher in the patient group with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (5 of 54, 9%) than in the group with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (5 of 250, 2%, p=0\n- Becit et al.  evaluated the effect on the surgical results of CABG of detecting graft dysfunction by intraoperative transit time flow measurement using the VeriQ system in a case–control study in Turkey. A pulsatility index of greater than 5 and diastolic filling percentage of less than 50% were used as the indicators of inadequate flow. The study compared the surgical outcomes \n- Nordgaard et al.  investigated the variation in pulsatility index measurement between 2 different flowmeters (VeriQ and Transonic) and examined whether increasing filtering of the flowmeter signals influenced flow curves and pulsatility index. The VeriQ and Transonic flowmeters have default filter settings of 20 Hz and 10 Hz respectively. Flow patterns in 19 patients recorded simultaneously by both flowmeters during CABG surgery were analysed. This showed that the VeriQ system provided systematically higher pulsatility index values than the Transonic device (mean ± standard deviation : 2.7±1.2 versus 1.8±0.6 respectively, p<0\n thought that assessing graft flow with transit time flow measurement alone may prompt unnecessary graft revision in some cases and there is inadequate evidence about whether transit time flow measurement predicts long-term patient survival.\n\n【6】 # Committee considerations\n- The committee recognised that graft dysfunction is a major determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality after CABG. It was advised that the majority of graft failures in the perioperative period are due to technical imperfections which, if recognised, might be corrected at the time of surgery.\n lead to readmission to hospital.\n- The committee considered that the available evidence supported the claim that transit time flow measured by the VeriQ system can identify grafts that have reduced flow as a result of technical imperfections.\n- The committee recognised limitations in the available evidence. The main studies were observational, with potential for bias. The study by Kieser et al.  investigated the VeriQ system on arterial grafts only, whereas in the NHS the majority of CABGs are vein grafts. Nevertheless, it judged that there was sufficient additional evidence relating to predecessor devices and sufficient expert advice to support the expectation that routinely revising all appropriate grafts on the basis of VeriQ measurements would result in reduced perioperative graft occlusions and consequent complications.\n- The committee noted from the study by Nordgaard et al.  that pulsatility index values from the VeriQ system may differ from those of other machines and are influenced by filter settings. However, these differences are systematic and expected to be predic\n- The committee was advised that cardiac surgeons use a variety of methods to minimise and detect technical imperfections during CABG surgery but these may have limitations. On the basis of the evidence, it judged that the routine use of VeriQ, as an adjunct to other methods of assessment such as transoesophageal echocardiography, electrocardiography and clinical assessment, would be likely to detect technical problems in some grafts that appear to be satisfactory on clinical assessment alone.\n- The committee noted that recent joint guidelines on myocardial revascularisation issued by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) have recommended graft evaluation by objective methods before leaving the operating theatre after CABG surgery. These guidelines  flow less than 20 ml/minute and a pulsatility index of greater than 5 as predicting technically inadequate grafts that need revision before leaving the operating theatre.\n- The committee recognised that the clinical outcomes of CABG surgery have improved in the UK in the past 20 years and that complication rates are now very low. However it was advised that there is still a perioperative graft occlusion rate of 1% to 3%. The committee considered that the VeriQ system has potential to reduce this graft occlusion rate and so further reduce morbidity and mortality after CABG.# NHS considerations\n\n【7】 # System impact\n- Approximately 22,500 isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations are performed in the UK each year. In addition, a substantial proportion of patients having other cardiac surgery (for example, valve replacement surgery) have concomitant CABG. Based on this large number of patients, any reduction in graft occlusion rates by the MiraQ system during CABG surgery potentially offers significant cost savings to the NHS.\n- The committee was informed that the MiraQ system is easy to use and does not significantly increase operative time.\n\n【8】 # Committee considerations\n- As described in section 3, the committee judged that reduction in graft occlusion rates by MiraQ assessment and appropriate revision at the time of surgery could decrease complication rates. This could reduce the likelihood of subsequent interventions, prolonged intensive therapy unit and hospital stay, and readmission. Each of these reductions would result in significant resource savings.# Cost considerations\n\n【9】 # Cost evidence\n- The economic evidence for the MiraQ system comprised a new cost analysis to assess the cost savings to the NHS of introducing the MiraQ system for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, compared against clinical assessment.\n- In the base-case analysis, the equipment cost for the MiraQ system was about £111 per procedure and the additional time for measuring flow in 3 grafts was 2.35 minutes. The equipment costs were based on the VeriQ 2011 console (purchase cost £32,000 with an anticipated life span of 10 years) and an average use of 1.7 probes per procedure (£1,582 per PS probe, which is recommended for up to 30 uses). The costs per patient were based on the purchase cost of a MiraQ system divided by 220 days' use per year over its life expectancy, including annual maintenance costs. Annual maintenance costs are payable from the end of year 2 at £1,800 per year. It was assumed that the annual maintenance costs for the remaining 8 years would be averaged over the 10‑year life expectancy of the equipment. All time costs in the model were based on the salaries of a CABG team comprising 2 cardiothoracic surgeons, 1 anaesthetist, 1 cardiac perfusionist and 2 cardiac nurses.\n- The cost model evaluated the cost savings of using the MiraQ system compared with clinical assessment alone in assessing graft flow in all patients having CABG. The outcomes considered in the model are complications associated with the CABG surgery.\n- The consequences of using the MiraQ system were based on results from 2 studies (Kieser et al.  and Becit et al. ). In the base-case analysis, use of the MiraQ system was associated with an increase of 6.6% in the graft revision rate (a 2.3% increase in minor revisions and a 4.3% increase in major revisions). Costs were based on the time taken by the CABG team to perform the revisions. The cost of the time taken to perform a minor revision was estimated to be £11, and for major revisions, £180.\n- The perioperative events included in the cost analysis were: incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction and the associated rehabilitation costs; use of intra-aortic balloon pumping; incidence and treatment costs of intraoperative re-exploration for bleeding; and incidence and treatment costs of deep sternal infection. The rates of these events for CABG with and without the MiraQ system were based on Becit et al. . The base-case analysis compared a 0% postoperative myocardial infarction rate for patients assessed clinically and with VeriQ versus a 5% rate for patients who had clinical assessment alone. The treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and associated rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £1,667 per patient. The cost of treatment by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,657 per episode. The base-case analysis compared a 1% rate for intra-aortic balloon pumping for patients assessed clinically and with VeriQ versus a 7% rate for patients who had clinical assessment alone. There was no difference in the rate of intraoperative re-exploration of bleeding and incidence of deep sternal infection between the arms of the model. No adverse event costs as a result of using the VeriQ system were included in the model because none have been reported.\n- The cost saving associated with the MiraQ system in the base case was £115 per patient based on purchase of a VeriQ 2011 console (£32,, using a PS probe (£1,582 for 30 uses), and annual maintenance costs (£1, payable at the end of year 2.\n- The sensitivity analysis based on the parameters and ranges identified by the manufacturer showed that estimates of cost saving for the MiraQ system are robust. The key drivers of the cost saving were the reduction in the rate of postoperative myocardial infarction and the reduction in use of intra-aortic balloon pumping associated with the use of the MiraQ system. The highest cost saving obtained in the sensitivity analysis was £323 per patient and was associated with 0% use of intra-aortic balloon pumping in patients assessed with the MiraQ system compared with a usage rate of 14% in patients assessed without the MiraQ system. The lowest cost saving, of £38 per patient, was obtained for a 2.5% postoperative myocardial infarction rate. The only case in which use of the MiraQ system was not cost saving (when the cost per patient was £ was when there was no change in the usage rate of intra-aortic balloon pumping in either arm of the model (3.5%). The external assessment centre advised that this is a pessimistic view and that the MiraQ system is likely to be cost saving when used appropriately.\n\n【10】 # Committee considerations\n- The committee considered that the assumptions made in the cost model were realistic and that the range of savings calculated for the use of MiraQ was likely to be realised in practice.\n- The committee noted that the manufacturer's cost model did not include potential cost savings from reductions in intensive therapy unit stay and reduced readmission rates. The cost savings associated with the MiraQ system may therefore have been underestimated.\n noted that the manufacturer's estimated usage of the MiraQ system at 1 patient per day for 220 days per year was likely to be conservative. The committee was advised that on average 3 to 4 CABG operations are performed per day in a cardiac operating theatre in the UK. Increased annual use of a MiraQ system is expected to reduce the estimated equipment cost per procedure because the capital cost of the VeriQ system will be divided across more procedures.\n- The committee considered that the reductions in perioperative myocardial infarction rate to zero and of intra-aortic balloon pump use from 7% to 1% when using the MiraQ system compared with clinical assessment alone in the base case were likely to be overestimates. This would tend to reduce the estimated cost savings of the MiraQ system. However, the committee noted that sensitivity analysis showed that if using the MiraQ system had no impact on the postoperative myocardial infarction rate or led to only a small change in intra-aortic balloon pumping rates (of less than 2%), the MiraQ system remained cost saving compared with clinical assessment alone, resulting in a saving to the NHS.\n\n【11】 # guidance review\n- For the guidance review, the external assessment centre (EAC) revised the model to reflect 2017 costs (original guidance values are given in brackets). The main parameter changes were the cost of the MiraQ console £34,000 (£32, and probes £1,481 (£1, with 50 uses (30 uses). These costs resulted in a MiraQ system cost of about £141 (£ per procedure. The cost of the time taken to perform a minor revision was estimated to be £24 (£, and for major revisions, £396 (£. Treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and associated rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £2,031 (£1, per patient and treatment cost by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,574 (£2, per episode. Base-case results for the 2017 revised model shows the cost saving associated with the MiraQ system was £141 (£ per patient. Further details of the 2017 revised model are in the revised model summary.\n\n【12】 # guidance review\n- For the 2022 guidance review, the EAC reviewed 87 studies that used the Medistim device (MiraQ or previous equivalent versions). It found that most of the evidence was based on single-arm studies with large in-between study heterogeneity. There was, therefore, not enough high-quality evidence to justify any changes to the guidance.\n- The EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs and changes to the cost of the technology. This reduced the cost saving compared with clinical assessment from £141 to £80.27. The EAC found that there was no justification for updating the clinical parameters of the economic model. Further details of the revised model are in the cost update in the review decision from June 2022. # Conclusions\n- The committee concluded that the available clinical and cost evidence supported the case for adopting the MiraQ system in the NHS for routine intraoperative graft flow assessment in patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#2#2# # The technology小标题另起一行\n多余换行#4#4#used\n Cardiac surgeons use是一句话\n缺少换行#4#4## Clinical evidence小标题另起一行\n缺少换行#6#6## NHS considerations小标题另起一行\n缺少换行#8#8## Cost considerations小标题另起一行\n缺少换行#12#12## Conclusions小标题另起一行\n", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:40:26"}

A cannula, or hollow needle, is carefully introduced into the thorax, generally after administration of local anesthesia. The procedure was first described in 1852.\n\n【2】 ## Procedure\n- Thoracocentesis can be performed by carefully inserting a needle into the pleural space, in order to aspirate the pathologically collected fluid or air and allow the compressed lung to re-inflate.\n- Ultrasound guided needle aspiration is a very useful technique\n- Ultrasound guided aspiration should be performed in order to reduce complications.\n\n【3】 ## Steps\n- First, confirm the extent of the pleural effusion or pneumothorax  by chest percussion and consider an imaging study, bedside ultrasonography is recommended  to reduce the risk of pneumothorax, hemothorax and to get the successful tap.\n- Needle is inserted in the mid-scapular line at the upper border of the rib one intercostal space below the top of the effusion.\n- Insertion point is marked with a skin marker, and prepare the area with a skin cleansing agent such as chlorhexidine.\n- Apply a sterile drape while wearing sterile gloves.\n- A sterile needle is used and local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously, and wheal is raised at the point marked. Slowly advance the needle deeper and inject anesthetic until reaching the parietal pleura, Infiltarte the parietal pleura as it is very sensitive. continue to advance the needle until pleural fluid is aspirated. Note the depth at which fluid is aspirated.\n- Now, take a large-bore (16- to 19-gauge) thoracentesis needle-catheter device and attach it to a 3-way stopcock, place a 30- to 50-mL syringe on one port of the stopcock and attach drainage tubing to the other port.\n- Insert this needle along the upper border of the rib while aspirating and advance it into the effusion.\n- When large amount of pleural fluid has to b aspirated, insert the catheter over the needle into the pleural space and withdraw the needle, leaving the catheter in the pleural space.\n- While preparing to insert the catheter, cover the needle opening during inspiration to prevent entry of air into the pleural space.\n- Withdraw 30 ml of fluid into the syringe and place the fluid in appropriate tubes and send for testing.\n- If a larger amount of fluid is to be drained, turn the stopcock and allow fluid to drain into a collection bag. Alternatively, aspirate fluid using the syringe, taking care to regularly release pressure on the plunger.\n- After the tapping is done, remove the catheter while patient is holding his breath or expiring.

BrownBoost is an adaptive version of the boost by majority algorithm.  As is true for all boosting algorithms, BrownBoost is used in conjunction with other machine learning methods.  BrownBoost was introduced by Yoav Freund.\n\n【1】 # Motivation\n- AdaBoost performs  well on a variety of datasets; however, it can be shown that AdaBoost does not perform well on noisy data sets.  This is a result of AdaBoost's focus on examples that are repeatedly misclassified.  In contrast, BrownBoost effectively \"gives up\" on examples that are repeatedly misclassified.\n- The user of the algorithm can set the amount of error to be tolerated in the training set.  Thus, if the training set is noisy (say 10% of all examples are assumed to be mislabeled), the booster can be told to accept a 10% error rate.  Since the noisy examples may be ignored, only the true examples will contribute to the learning process.\n\n【2】 # BrownBoost Learning Algorithm\n- BrownBoost is unique in that it uses a non-convex potential loss function, thus it does not fit into the AnyBoost framework.  The non-convex optimization provides a method to avoid overfitting data sets. AdaBoost has one parameter to set: the number of rounds of boosting.

The terms sinusitis and rhinosinusitis are used interchangeably, although rhinosinusitis is preferred because inflammation of the paranasal sinuses rarely ever occurs without concurrent inflammation of the nasal mucosa. There are 4 pairs of sinus cavities, named for the skull bones they are located in: maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphenoidal. The cause of rhinosinusitis is mostly infectious, although it can be associated with other medical conditions such as allergies. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and imaging and other diagnostic studies are not necessary for diagnosis. A CT or MRI is indicated when rhinosinusitis is complicated by extension of the infection to surrounding structures, such as the orbit and brain. Rhinosinusitis is a self-limiting disease and treatment is supportive, in order to alleviate the respiratory symptoms and pain. Antibiotics may be indicated in select cases of acute bacterial and chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- Between 3700 and 1500 BC, the paranasal sinuses were first identified by the ancient Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians are considered to have been the first in discovering sinus surgery; when mummifying a human body, they would remove the brain through the nasal cavity.\n documented in his writings about nasal polyps and how to remove them.\n- In 1489, Leonardo Da Vinci was the first to illustrate the maxillary sinuses and their relationship with the teeth of the upper jaw.\n- In 1905, the first paper in literature was found on suppurative frontal sinusitis.\n\n【3】 # Classification\n be classified according to the duration of the disease or etiology.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- The pathophysiology for both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis involves blockage of the nasal sinuses and inflammation of the nasal sinuses. However, biofilms play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis. There are many associated conditions with rhinosinusitis, but most notably are those related to allergy and immunodeficiency.\n\n【5】 # Causes\n- The causes of rhinosinusitis can be divided according to the infectious group that causes it into: bacterial, viral and fungal.\n\n【6】 # Differential Diagnosis\n- Rhinosinusitis must be differentiated from other diseases that may present with a headache and/or respiratory symptoms.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The incidence of acute rhinosinusitis and prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis have a wide range, depending on the setting.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\n- Anatomical abnormalities of the nasal cavity, immunodeficiency and other diseases are all risk factors for the development of rhinosinusitis.\n\n【9】 # Screening\n- There are no recommendations for screening for rhinosinusitis.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n- Acute rhinosinusitis is a self-limiting disease. However, rarely acute and chronic rhinosinusitis can be complicated by extension of the infection to the surrounding structures, such as the eyes and brain.\n\n【11】 # History and Symptoms\n- Rhinosinusitis can present with a wide range of constitutional and respiratory symptoms.\n\n【12】 # Physical Examination\n- Examination of the nose with a speculum or otoscope may reveal mucosal edema, narrowing of the middle meatus, purulent rhinorrhea and other findings.\n\n【13】 # Laboratory Findings\n- There are several lab findings that can be done when suspecting rhinosinusitis, but these findings are nonspecific.\n\n【14】 # X-Ray\n- A plain x-ray of the sinuses has no role in the workup of rhinosinusitis. It may show a fluid level in the sinuses, but a plain x-ray is associated with a high negative and high positive rate for rhinosinusitis.\n\n【15】 # CT\n- Although not routinely indicated for suspected cases of rhinosinusitis and findings are highly nonspecific, CT scan is the imaging modality of choice in cases of chronic or complicated rhinosinusitis. Positive CT scan findings are not essential for diagnosis, but negative CT scan findings rules out rhinosinusitis. Findings include mucosal thickening and narrowing of the osteomeatal sinuses.\n\n【16】 # Other Imaging Findings\n- MRI is an excellent alternative to CT scan in detecting orbital and intracranial complications of rhinosinusitis.\n\n【17】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n- Nasal endoscopy and anterior rhinoscopy can be done in the case of rhinosinusitis to evaluate for nasal anatomy, nasal polyps and the paranasal sinuses. Endoscopy can be done as part of the functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), which is used as a treatment in the case of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps.\n\n【18】 # Medical Therapy\n- Supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for both cases of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. Antibiotics can be added in select cases of acute, as well as chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\n【19】 # Surgery\n- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is reserved for cases of chronic rhinosinusitis not responding to medical therapy.\n\n【20】 # Primary Prevention\n- There are no clear guidelines on how to prevent the occurrence of rhinosinusitis.\n\n【21】 # Secondary Prevention\n- Secondary prevention is mostly aimed at preventing the exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis or another episode of acute recurrent sinusitis.

Tremor and dystonia associated with Parkinson's disease are not covered by this guidance.\n- Tremor is an involuntary rhythmic repetitive movement, most frequently affecting the upper limbs. It can occur at rest or can be brought on (or exacerbated) by posture or intentional movement. Severe tremor can be disabling because it affects fine-movement coordination.\n- Dystonia is the simultaneous uncoordinated contraction of opposing antagonistic muscles. It may be limited to a particular group of muscles, or it may be generalised.\n- Tremor can be treated by rehabilitation and drug therapy, and early appropriate treatment may minimise functional disability. Anti-tremor drugs reduce the amplitude but not the frequency of tremor, and this does not always translate into functional improvement. Surgery, which often involves ablation of the thalamic nucleus, is usually reserved for patients with severe disabling tremor and functional disability that interferes with activities of daily living, and for tremor that is refractory to the highest tolerated doses of medication.\n- Dystonia can be treated conservatively or surgically. Currently available conservative management options for dystonia improve the symptoms but do not cure the underlying neurological disorder. The severity of dystonia may progress over time as part of the underlying neurological condition. Surgical options include thalamotomy and pallidotomy; however, benefits may not be maintained in the long term.\n\n【3】 # Outline of the procedure\n- Deep brain stimulation can be carried out on structures within the brain that are responsible for modifying movements, such as the thalamus, the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, which interact functionally with the substantia negra (nigra). These structures are all bilateral, and surgery can be performed on one or both sides. The function of these brain nuclei is altered during deep brain stimulation through the application of an electrical current.\n- The procedure involves inserting fine needles into the brain through small holes in the skull under imaging guidance, to determine the exact position of the targeted nucleus, which may be different in each patient. One or more permanent electrodes are subsequently placed into this nucleus. Wires are tunnelled subcutaneously to the anterior chest wall, where they are connected to an implanted pulse generator. Local or general anaesthetic may be used in this procedure.\n- Further operations may be required for replacement of the pulse generator.\n\n【4】 # Efficacy\n- A case–control series found that, in up to 27 months' follow-up, total tremor score improved in 17 patients treated with deep brain stimulation, but there was no significant improvement in most other efficacy outcomes. A case series of 52 patients with essential tremor who underwent deep brain stimulation reported a significant improvement in activities of daily living at 3 months' follow-up, with scores improving from 17.8 points to 6.5 points (p < 0 Another case series of 19 patients found that deep brain stimulation produced an improvement in tremor score (Fahn–Tolosa–Marin scale) from 3.3 points at baseline to 0.8 points at 27 months' follow-up (p < 0\n- A case series of 22 patients with dystonia who underwent deep brain stimulation reported that the total score on the Burke–Fahn–Marsden dystonia rating scale improved significantly from a mean of 46.3 points at baseline to 24.3 points at 3 months' follow-up. This improvement was maintained to 12 months' follow-up, with a score of 21.0 points (p < 0.001 for both comparisons with baseline). Similarly, global disability score improved from 11.6 points at baseline to 7.6 points at 3 months' follow-up and 6.5 points at 12 months' follow-up (p < 0\n- Very few data are available on the use of deep brain stimulation for tremor in multiple sclerosis. Three case series reported significant improvements in tremor secondary to multiple sclerosis at 12–22 months; however, two of these studies found that improvements in tremor did not necessarily correlate with improvements in functional ability. For more details,  the 'Sources of evidence' section.\n- The Specialist Advisers noted that there are concerns about the long-term efficacy of the procedure, because tremor may become resistant to stimulation.\n\n【5】 # Safety\n- One case series reported that the pulse generator failed in 50% (6/ of patients. Across three case series where it was reported as an outcome, displacement of the stimulating electrode occurred in 6% (1/, 8% (1/ and 15% (8/ of patients. The incidence of lead fracture or failure in three studies was 4% (2/, 5% (1/ and 6% (1/.

It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n- This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n available.\n- Changes since publication\n\n【9】 - Your responsibility\n- This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n- Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n\n【10】 - \n\n【11】 - \n-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#1#1## The procedure小标题需换行\n缺少换行#8#8##About this guidance小标题需换行\n多余换行#8#8#This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.available.Changes since publication这是一句话不用换行", "type3": "无关文本#5#5#For more details, the ‘Sources of evidence’ section.", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-09 22:01:09"}

People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\n- Why the committee made these recommendations\n- Giant cell arteritis is usually treated with a high dose of glucocorticoids, which is gradually reduced over time. High doses of glucocorticoids may cause a number of problems, including skin problems, weight gain, diabetes and osteoporosis.\n- Clinical trial results show that after having tocilizumab plus a tapering course of glucocorticoids for 1 year, more people stay in remission and need lower doses of glucocorticoids compared with people having glucocorticoids alone.\n- In the full population, the most plausible cost-effectiveness estimates were above the range normally considered to be a cost-effective use of NHS resource, even when tocilizumab is used for only 1 year. For the subgroup of people with relapsing or refractory disease, using the committee's preferred assumptions (including that tocilizumab is given for 1 year at most), the most likely cost-effectiveness estimate compared with glucocorticoids alone is £24,977 per quality-adjusted life year gained. This is within the range normally considered to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources, so tocilizumab is recommended.# Information about tocilizumab\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\n- Tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) has a marketing authorisation for 'the treatment of adults with giant cell arteritis'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\n- Subcutaneous injection (162 mg) once every week in combination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. Tocilizumab can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids, but monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses. Treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease activity, physician discretion and patient choice.\n\n【5】 £913.12 for 4 syringes containing 162 mg tocilizumab (excluding VAT). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes tocilizumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n\n【6】 # A new treatment option\n\n【7】 ## People would welcome a new treatment that reduces the cumulative amount of glucocorticoids needed\n noted unpleasant side effects with glucocorticoids such as skin changes and weight gain. They highlighted that because the disease is most common among people 50 years and older, these side effects are often in addition to existing health problems. The patient experts emphasised that glucocorticoid-sparing agents are very important for people with giant cell arteritis, especially for those with relapsing or refractory disease, who are subject to excessive cumulative dosage of glucocorticoids. The committee concluded that people with giant cell arteritis would welcome a new treatment option that reduces flares of the disease and the cumulative amount of glucocorticoids needed.\n\n【8】 # Subgroups\n\n【9】 ## People with relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis have the highest unmet need\n highlighted a high unmet need in patients with newly diagnosed giant cell arteritis with comorbidities, there was no data available for the company to do an analysis in this subgroup. The committee concluded that the relapsing or refractory subgroup was distinct and biologically plausible and had the highest unmet need. Therefore it considered both the full population and the relapsing or refractory subgroup in its decision making.\n\n【10】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【11】 # Theweeklytocilizumaband52‑weekglucocorticoidtaperarmsof GiACTAreflectthelicenseand British Societyfor Rheumatologyguidelines\n- The main clinical evidence for tocilizumab came from GiACTA, a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. The trial followed patients for 52 weeks, at which point they were enrolled in an open-label extension study which is still ongoing. Patients in the tocilizumab arm had tocilizumab plus glucocorticoids for 26 weeks, followed by tocilizumab alone for the remaining 26 weeks. The primary outcome of the trial investigated whether more people achieve sustained disease remission at 52 weeks with tocilizumab and glucocorticoids compared with glucocorticoids alone. Secondary outcomes included time to first flare after disease remission and cumulative glucocorticoid dose. The trial included 4 arms:\n- tocilizumab every week with 26‑week prednisone taper (n=\n- tocilizumab every 2 weeks with 26‑week prednisone taper (n=\n- placebo with 26‑week prednisone taper (n=\n noted that prednisolone, not prednisone, is usually used in the NHS, but considered that the 2 drugs are very similar. The committee concluded that the 2 arms included in the company's economic model (that is, weekly tocilizumab and placebo with 52‑week prednisone taper) are most relevant to clinical practice in England.\n\n【12】 # Patientsin GiACTAreflectthosewithgiantcellarteritisin England\n have large vessel disease. It is less likely to be diagnosed in the NHS because there is a lower utilisation of advanced imaging than in the trial. As such, the proportion in the trial is likely to reflect the true proportion with large vessel disease in England. The committee concluded that the patients in the trial reflect those with giant cell arteritis in England.\n\n【13】 ## The 52‑week glucocorticoid taper does not reflect clinical practice in England and might bias the results in favour of tocilizumab\n aware that 49% of patients in the comparator arm did not have disease remission after the 6‑week screening phase of the trial, but that nonetheless they had to start the 52‑week tapering regimen. The committee was concerned that this might bias the primary end point of the trial (sustained remission at 52 weeks) in favour of tocilizumab, because it is less likely that people whose disease has not responded to high-dose glucocorticoids would achieve remission with lower doses. In response to consultation, the company submitted evidence from a new exploratory analysis that suggested there is no difference in primary end point analysed by remission status at baseline in the trial. However, without any statistical analyses from the company to support this conclusion, the committee remained concerned about potential bias in the primary end point in favour of tocilizumab. It concluded that the 52‑week glucocorticoid taper arm of the trial does not reflect clinical practice in England and might bias the results in favour of tocilizumab.\n\n【14】 ## Tocilizumab plus a tapering course of glucocorticoids is more effective than glucocorticoids alone\n- The company presented results for the overall intention-to-treat population of GiACTA, as well as for both the newly diagnosed and relapsing subgroups. The results showed that tocilizumab plus a tapering course of glucocorticoids was more effective than glucocorticoids alone at increasing the proportion of patients sustaining remission at 52 weeks, and increasing the time to first flare for the overall population and both subgroups . The committee recalled that in clinical practice, newly diagnosed disease and relapsing disease are managed differently, but the results were similarly effective across both subgroups. The committee concluded that tocilizumab is more effective than glucocorticoids alone at increasing sustained remission and time to first flare.\n- Population\n- Sustained remission at 52 weeks (%)\n- Time to first flare hazard ratio\n(99% confidence interval)\n- Median cumulative glucocorticoids dose (mg)\n- Overall population:\n- tocilizumab (n=\n(0.18 to 0.\n- Overall population: placebo (n=\n- Newly diagnosed subgroup: tocilizumab (n=\n(0.29 to 1.\n- Newly diagnosed subgroup: placebo (n=\n- Relapsing subgroup: tocilizumab (n=\n(0.14 to 0.\n- Relapsing subgroup: placebo (n=\n\n【15】 # Adverse events\n\n【16】 ## Because tocilizumab is taken with glucocorticoids, the extent to which glucocorticoid-related adverse events are reduced is unclear\n- The committee considered the benefits of tocilizumab in terms of a reduction in cumulative glucocorticoid dose and risk of glucocorticoid-related adverse events. The committee noted that although the tapering regimen with tocilizumab is shorter than when glucocorticoids are used alone, disease flares are treated by increasing the glucocorticoid dose, and a tapering regimen restarted. As such, people taking tocilizumab could still be exposed to large cumulative doses of glucocorticoids. The committee acknowledged that the median cumulative glucocorticoid dose was lower in the tocilizumab arm of GiACTA , but noted that this was over the relatively short 52‑week follow-up. It was concerned that despite the lower median cumulative glucocorticoid dose in the tocilizumab arm, the rate of glucocorticoid-related adverse events was similar between trial arms (50% compared with 49%). The committee acknowledged that this might be because many glucocorticoid-related adverse events only manifest in the longer term. In response to consultation, the company provided new evidence from post-hoc trial analyses that showed a higher rate of glucocorticoid-related adverse events being seen in the comparator arm. However, the committee was concerned that the data were analysed retrospectively and not based on standard or prespecified criteria. In addition, the company did not provide any statistical analyses to support the comparison of glucocorticoid-related adverse events between arms. The committee concluded that because glucocorticoids still need to be taken with tocilizumab, the extent to which glucocorticoid-related adverse events are reduced is unclear.\n\n【17】 # The company's economic model\n\n【18】 ## The structure of the model is adequate for decision making\n have a flare, giant cell arteritis-related adverse events and glucocorticoid-related adverse events. Both taking glucocorticoids and disease flares were associated with a utility decrement. The committee concluded that the structure of the model was adequate for decision making.\n\n【19】 # Duration of tocilizumab treatment\n\n【20】 # A1-yearstoppingrulecanbeimplementedin NHSpractice\n stated that a 1-year stopping rule could be implemented in NHS practice. The committee therefore concluded that it would include the 1-year stopping rule in its decision making.\n\n【21】 # Extrapolation of time to first flare\n\n【22】 ## The company's extrapolation after 52 weeks lacks validity\n suggest that at 5 years, 30% to 50% of people having glucocorticoids alone will not have disease relapse; at the same time point, the company's model predicted this to be less than 2%. The committee concluded that the company's extrapolation of time to first flare lacked validity.\n\n【23】 # The ERG'sapproachtoextrapolationismoreappropriate\n- The ERG suggested an alternative approach to extrapolating time to first flare for the comparator arm, in which it switches to the same Weibull distribution as the weekly tocilizumab arm after 2 years. The committee considered that this addressed the issue of the relative benefit of tocilizumab continuing after treatment stops, because all patients that have successfully completed the taper in either arm have the same decreasing risk of disease relapse. Using this approach, the ERG predicted that at year 5 around 12% of patients in the comparator arm would not have relapsing disease (falling to 8% by year . The committee concluded although the ERG's approach may still overestimate the risk of flare in the comparator arm, it provided more clinically realistic estimates of the proportion of patients with disease relapse after having glucocorticoids alone.\n\n【24】 # Estimating rates of subsequent flares\n\n【25】 # The ERG'sapproachresultsinmorerealisticestimatesofsubsequentflares\n- The company used GiACTA data to estimate rates of subsequent flares that were used in the economic model. The ERG noted that the company's estimate for the tocilizumab newly diagnosed subgroup was higher than for the relapsing subgroup, which is clinically implausible. In addition, the company's model predicted a high number of flares for people having glucocorticoids alone, which lacks validity. For example, over the same period of 10 years, a longitudinal cohort study of people with giant cell arteritis taking glucocorticoids alone  reported less than half the flares predicted by the company's model. The ERG derived probabilities based on this study that were logically consistent across the subgroups. The committee considered that when the ERG's probabilities for subsequent flare are combined with its approach to time to first flare extrapolation, the predicted mean number of flares over the model time horizon for the comparator arm is more plausible than the company's approach. In the company's revised model for people with relapsing or refractory disease, it proposed an additional 10% adjustment to the ERG's estimated rates of subsequent flares to provide a better estimate in the control arm of the relapsing subgroup. The ERG stated that this had already been accounted for in its own estimates, so no adjustments were needed. The committee concluded that the ERG's approach to estimating the probability of subsequent flares was more appropriate.\n\n【26】 # Utility values in the model\n\n【27】 ## The company's model adequately captures the negative effect of flares and glucocorticoids on quality of life\n\n【28】 # The company's updated economic analysis\n\n【29】 ## The company's ICER for tocilizumab in relapsing or refractory disease is £18,801 per QALY gained with a 1-year stopping rule\n- The company's original base-case deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was £28,272 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. This was based on a 2-year stopping rule and included a confidential patient access scheme discount for tocilizumab. In response to consultation, the company updated its economic model to focus only on the subgroup of people with relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis. The updated economic model included the committee's preferred assumptions, specifically:\n- a mean age of 73 years (section 3.\n- switching the time to first flare extrapolation for glucocorticoids alone to the same Weibull function as tocilizumab after 2 years (section 3.\n included a number of company-preferred assumptions and corrections, specifically:\n- incorporating a 1-year stopping rule for tocilizumab (section 3.\n- incorporating the slowest glucocorticoid taper regimen (24 months) in the comparator arm to match NHS practice\n- incorporating the costs for emergency department visits\n- updating the costs of glucocorticoid-related adverse events to reflect 2017 health care utilisation, specifically:\n- including additional costs for a yearly DEXA scan and prophylaxis medication\n- inflating diabetes costs from 2005 to 2017 estimates\n- revising fracture costs \n- revising infection costs (based on Sarnes \n- adjusting the ERG's flare rate to better reflect relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis in the comparator arm of GiACTA\n- correcting 2 programming errors: using the average weight of the relapsing and refractory population in GiACTA to calculate concomitant medication dosage (instead of the UK population), and correcting the yearly concomitant medication costs applied to the comparator arm.When incorporating these changes, the deterministic ICER for tocilizumab plus prednisolone compared with prednisolone alone, incorporating the confidential patient access scheme, was £18,801 per QALY gained in people with relapsed or refractory giant cell arteritis (a probabilistic ICER was not provided).\n\n【30】 # The ERG'supdatedalternativeeconomicanalysis\n\n【31】 ## The ERG's ICER for tocilizumab in relapsing and refractory disease is £24,977 per QALY gained when a 1-year stopping rule is applied\n applied. The ERG's revised economic model included a 1-year stopping rule, and focused only on people with relapsing or refractory disease. It made a number of other changes in its revised model, specifically:\n- using both the average weight and body surface area estimates of the relapsing or refractory population in GiACTA to calculate the dosages of concomitant medication\n\n【32】 - including costs for a single DEXA scan, instead of yearly scans, and using average generic cost estimate for oral therapies (taken from NICE's technology appraisal guidance on bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis)\n\n【33】 # Themostplausible ICERafterconsultation\n\n【34】 ## Tocilizumab is cost-effective only for relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis and when a 1-year stopping rule is applied\n- The committee preferred the ERG's estimates for both the overall population and people with relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis, because they better reflected its preferred assumptions. It therefore concluded that the most plausible ICERs for tocilizumab plus prednisolone compared with prednisolone alone, incorporating the confidential patient access scheme, were £65,501 (2-year treatment duration) and £36,960 (1-year treatment duration) per QALY gained for the overall population and £55,924 (2-tear treatment duration) and £24,977 (1-year treatment duration) per QALY gained for people with relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis. The ICERs for the overall population were higher than the range normally considered to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources (usually £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY), as were the ICERs when a 2-year treatment duration was applied, so the committee concluded that it would recommend tocilizumab as a cost-effective use of NHS resources only for treating relapsing or refractory giant cell arteritis and if a 1-year stopping rule is applied.\n\n【35】 # Other factors\n\n【36】 # Therearenoadditionalbenefitsthatarenotcapturedinthe QALYcalculations\n- The clinical experts highlighted that tocilizumab is the first new treatment for giant cell arteritis in several years. The committee was aware that before its marketing authorisation was granted, tocilizumab received a Promising Innovative Medicines designation for this indication. The patient experts explained that high doses of glucocorticoids are needed to treat flares and afterwards the tapering regimen must be restarted. This can have a large negative effect on quality of life, which may not be captured in the modelling. However, the committee noted that in the model, patients have a substantially lower utility during a flare, which is assumed to last for 4 weeks (section 3 In addition, after a disease flare, all patients have glucocorticoids and this is associated with a utility decrement (section 3 The committee concluded that there were no additional benefits that had not been captured in the QALY calculation.\n\n【37】 ## The recommendations do not have a different impact on people protected by equality legislation than on the wider population\n- The committee discussed equality issues, and agreed that its recommendations apply equally regardless of age. In addition, issues related to differences in prevalence or incidence of a disease cannot be addressed in a technology appraisal.

The mesh is then passed up the side of the vagina, across the top, and down the other side, and out through the incision in the other buttock. Both ends are cut so that they end just below the surface of the skin. The mesh is sutured to the top of the vagina to act as a tension-free sling that aims to support the vaginal vault. The procedure is sometimes described as posterior intravaginal slingplasty.\n- This procedure can be combined with surgery for stress urinary incontinence, such as a sub-urethral sling placement.\n- Several different types of synthetic and biological mesh are available that vary in structure and in physical properties such as absorbability.# Efficacy\n- This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. \n- In a systematic review of surgery using mesh for vaginal vault or uterine prolapse in 7,054 patients (which included 976 patients treated by infracoccygeal sacropexy) the results after a median follow-up of 13 months were as follows: prolapse recurrence rate 5% (range 0 to 25%; n=, rate of patient-reported persistent symptoms 9% (range 2 to 21%; n=, and reoperation rate 8% (range 0 to 30%; n=.

There is always an underlying disease that results in respiratory failure. The cause must be identified in order two classify, diagnose and treat respiratory failure. In some instances it could result in persistent lung injury. Mortality rate increases with age. The incidence is approximately 137.1 per 100,000 individuals in the united states. Common risk factors include smoking, alcohol abuse, COPD exacerbation and obesity. If left untreated patients with respiratory failure may develop sepsis and multiple organ failure which could result in death. It is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, the hallmark being shortness of breath which could be correlated with arterial blood gases to classify and diagnose the patient. Correction of ABG's by mechanical ventilation is the mainstay of treatment.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- The diagnostic and treatment strategies for respiratory failure and it's associated conditions have come a long way. Since the discovery of the stethoscope by René Laennec in 1816, to the work of Fenn and his team in 1946 on pulmonary gas exchange, the use of cuffed endotracheal tubes by Ibsen in 1954 to administer positive pressure ventilation to patients in respiratory failure who were admitted to the intensive care units, that became common in the United States in 1960.\n\n【3】 # Classification\n- Respiratory failure may be classified into several subtypes as follows; Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- Respiratory failure is the result of inadequate gas exchange in the pulmonary circulation. This could result from lung failure or pump failure. Lung failure which is failure of gas exchange results in hypoxemia (PaCO. Type I respiratory failure has a V/Q mismatch that causes hypoxemia. Type II respiratory failure is caused by alveolar hypoventilation which results in hypercapnia. Type III respiratory failure in the peri-operative period clinically progresses to Type I or Type II respiratory failure. Type IV respiratory failure results from an underlying circulatory collapse.\n\n【5】 # Causes\n- Common causes of respiratory failure include pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, atelectasis, asthma, COPD, neuromuscular and chest wall disorders, inadequate post-operative analgesia, smoking, obesity and shock. Life-threatening causes of respiratory failure include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute on chronic respiratory failure, pulmonary infection, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia and lung cancer.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Respiratory Failurefromother Diseases\n- As respiratory failure manifests in a variety of clinical forms, differentiation must be established in accordance with the particular type of respiratory failure. Type I respiratory failure must be differentiated from other disease that cause hypoxia, such as acute decompensated heart failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, high altitude pulmonary edema, neurogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and idiopathic chronic lung fibrosis. In contrast Type II respiratory failure must be differentiated from other diseases that cause hypercapnia, such as COPD, status asthmaticus, opioid toxicity, myasthenia crisis, Guillain-Barré syndrome. As well as Type III preoperative respiratory failure and Type IV respiratory failure.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The incidence of respiratory failure is approximately 137.1 per 100,000 individuals in the United States and the mortality rate is approximately 29%-42%. The incidence is higher among patients ≥ 65 years of age and the mortality rate is higher among African-Americans and Hispanics compared to Caucasians. Men and women are equally affected.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\n- Common risk factors in the development of respiratory failure include smoking, alcohol abuse, COPD exacerbation, obesity.\n\n【9】 # Screening\n- There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for respiratory failure.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n- Common complications of respiratory failure include, pulmonary emboli, barotrauma, fibrosis and pneumonia. If left untreated patients with respiratory failure may progress to develop sepsis and multiple organ failure which increases mortality. The mortality rate of respiratory failure is approximately 29%-42%.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 # Diagnostic Studyof Choice\n- Respiratory failure is mainly diagnosed based on clinical presentation. There is no single diagnostic study of choice for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, but respiratory failure can be diagnosed based on history, examination and arterial blood gases.\n\n【13】 ## History and Symptoms\n- A positive history of sudden onset of shortness of breath, trauma to the neck or thorax and change in mental status is suggestive of respiratory failure. Common symptoms of respiratory failure include tachypnea , stridor and dyspnea. Less common symptoms of respiratory failure include anxiety, headache, and asterixis.\n\n【14】 ## Physical Examination\n- Patients with respiratory failure usually appear distressed with altered mental status. Physical examination of patients with respiratory failure is usually remarkable for dyspnea, stridor, and tachypnea.\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of respiratory failure include abnormal bicarbonate, oxygen, phosphate, and magnesium levels.\n\n【16】 ## Chest X-ray\n- X-ray may be helpful in establishing the etiology of respiratory failure as it may detect underlying disease. Findings on x-ray suggestive of pre-existing COPD include hyperinflation and a flattened diaphragm. X-ray findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease include reticular nodular shadows. Findings on x-ray suggestive of acute respiratory distress include cardiomegaly, redistribution of vessels, peribronchial cuffing, pleural effusion, lines within the septum, and bat-wing distribution of perihilar infiltrates. Finally, thoracic cage abnormalities may be detected such as kyphosis, scoliosis, pectus excavatum, fractured ribs and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as diaphragmatic paralysis.\n\n【17】 ## Electrocardiogram\n- An ECG may be helpful in detecting underlying cardiovascular disease and to diagnose arrhythmia arising as a complication of severe hypoxemia and acidosis.\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\n reveal pathology of the neck, brainstem and peripheral nervous system, such as stroke, tumor and transection of the spinal cord.\n\n【19】 # MRI\n- MRI may be helpful in establishing the etiology of respiratory failure, in particular if the cause is due to a pathology of the neck, central or peripheral nervous system. MRI can predict the occurence of respiratory failure in a patient with cervical spine injury. MRI may suggest that stroke, tumor, spinal cord injury and/or complete spinal transection are the cause of respiratory failure. Findings on MRI may include embolism, thrombosis, and haemorrhage.\n\n【20】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\n useful in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure as the function of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery pressure may be monitored. Thoracic ultrasound is a part of critical care ultrasonography and may be helpful in the diagnosis of acute cardiopulmonary respiratory failure. Findings on an ultrasound suggestive of respiratory failure include the presence of pneumothorax, alveolar and interstitial aeration abnormalities, and pleural effusion.\n\n【21】 # Other Imaging Findings\n- There are no other imaging findings associated with respiratory failure.\n\n【22】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n- Despite most patients being unable to perform a pulmonary function test during acute respiratory failure, pulmonary function testing may be useful with chronic respiratory failure. Chronic respiratory failure is usually due to an underlying restrictive disease, pulmonary function test findings include a decrease in FEV1 and a significant decrease in FVC with an overall increase in the FEV1/FVC ratio. It is unlikely that an obstructive lung disease would cause respiratory failure. In respiratory failure with significant cardiac function compromise, a right side cardiac catheter may be used. Catheterization is controversially used to assess those patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure where cardiac function is uncertain.\n\n【23】 # Treatment\n\n【24】 ## Medical Therapy\n- There is no treatment for respiratory failure; however, medication may be used to allow for easier intubation and to ease anxiety in the patient. Recently, studies have demonstrated a strong recommendation against the use of sedatives or analgesics. The use of these agents has been implicated in decreasing the success rates of ventilation mechanisms.\n\n【25】 ## Oxygen Therapy\n- A trial of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be carried out in order to achieve hypoxemic correction. NIV is advantageous in carrying less infection and mortality rates than traditional mechanical ventilation. ECMO is a cardiopulmonary support machine that is useful in cases of acute severe respiratory failure.\n\n【26】 ## Mechanical Ventilation\n- Mechanical ventilation aims to correct abnormalities in oxygenation of the blood and tissues, reduce the respiratory effort and prevent dynamic hyperinflation. Different modes of ventilation are available to suit each patient's individual needs, such as assisted-control ventilation.\n\n【27】 ## Primary Prevention\n- Effective measures for the primary prevention of respiratory failure include control of primary illness that may lead to respiratory failure. In addition, the administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations to patients at risk such as COPD and asthma patients is very important in preventing respiratory failure. Finally, smoking cessation will help to minimize the risk for respiratory failure.\n\n【28】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- Effective measures for the secondary prevention of respiratory failure include monitoring and medical compliance of patients with chronic lung disease such as asthma.\n\n【29】 # Futureor Investigational Therapies\n- Noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NPSV) using a new special helmet has undergone a pilot trial, where it successfully treated hypoxemic ARF, with a higher tolerance and less complications than a conventional face mask.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type2": null, "type4": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:10:45"}

Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take tranylcypromine.\n- If your child's doctor has prescribed tranylcypromine for your child, you should watch his or her behavior very carefully, especially at the beginning of treatment and any time his or her dose is increased or decreased. Your child may develop serious symptoms very suddenly, so it is important to pay attention to his or her behavior every day. Call your child's doctor right away if he or she experiences any of these symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing him- or herself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; irritability; aggressive behavior; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; frenzied abnormal excitement, or any other sudden or unusual changes in behavior.\n can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website:\n want to speak with you or your child by telephone from time to time. Be sure that your child keeps all appointments for office visits or telephone conversations with his or her doctor.\n- Talk to your child's doctor about the risks of giving tranylcypromine to your child.\n\n【2】 # Why is this medication prescribed\n- Tranylcypromine is used to treat depression in people who have not been helped by other medications. Tranylcypromine is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances that are needed to maintain mental balance.\n\n【3】 # How should this medicine be used\n- Tranylcypromine comes as a t to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take tranylcypromine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tranylcypromine exactly as directed.\n- Tranylcypromine may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if you find that you want to take extra medication or you notice any other unusual changes in your behavior or mood.\n- Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of tranylcypromine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 1-3 weeks. After your symptoms improve, your doctor will probably gradually decrease your dose of tranylcypromine.\n- Tranylcypromine controls the symptoms of depression but does not cure it. It may take 3 weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of tranylcypromine. Continue to take tranylcypromine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tranylcypromine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually.\n\n【4】 # Other uses for this medicine\n- This medication is sometimes prescribed \n\n【5】 # What special precautions should I follow\n- Before taking tranylcypromine\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tranylcypromine or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor if you are taking, you have recently taken, or you plan to take any of the following prescription or non-prescription medications: certain other antidepressants including amitriptyline (Elavil), amoxapine, clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), maprotiline, nortriptyline (Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil); amphetamines such as amphetamine (in Adderall), benzphetamine (Didrex), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Dextrostat, in Adderall), and methamphetamine (Desoxyn); bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban); buspirone (BuSpar); caffeine (No-Doz, Quick-Pep, Vivarin); cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril); dexfenfluramine (Redux) (not available in the U.S.); dextromethorphan (Robitussin, others); diuretics ('water pills'); levodopa (Larodopa, in Sinemet);medications for allergies,cough and cold symptoms, and hay fever;medications for high blood pressure such as guanethidine (Ismelin) (not available in the U.S.), methyldopa (Aldomet), and reserpine (Serpalan);medications for Parkinson's disease, anxiety, or weight loss (diet pills); medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Tegretol); narcotic medications for pain; other MAOIs such as isocarboxazid (Marplan); pargyline (not available in the U.S.), phenelzine (Nardil), procarbazine (Matulane), and selegiline (Eldepryl); meperidine (Demerol); sedatives; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram (Celexa), duloxetine (Cymbalta), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft);sleeping pills; tranquilizers; and medications containing alcohol (Nyquil, elixirs, others).Your doctor may tell you not to take tranylcypromine if you are taking or have recently stopped taking one or more of these medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.

This is more common when you first start taking tranylcypromine. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n- you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. These changes may occur at any time if you have depression or another mental illness, whether or not you are taking tranylcypromine or any other medication. You, your family, or caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied, abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor when you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n【6】 # What special dietary instructions should I follow\n avoid foods and drinks that contain caffeine during your treatment with tranylcypromine. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or dietitian if you have any questions about what you may eat and drink during your treatment.\n\n【7】 # Whatshould Idoif Iforgetadose\n- Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases α, β, and γ.\n\n【3】 # Antiviral Activityin Cell Culture\n inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC95 value = 6 nM).

Common adverse reactions include hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, nausea, headache.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【4】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n- The optimal magnitude and rate of blood pressure reduction in acutely hypertensive patients have not been rigorously determined, but, in general, both delay and too rapid decreases appear undesirable in sick adult patients. An initial fenoldopam dose may be chosen from s 2 and 3 below in the Clinical studies section that produces the desired magnitude and rate of blood pressure reduction in a given clinical situation. Doses below 0.1 mcg/kg/min have very modest effects and appear only marginally useful in this population. In general, as the initial dose increases, there is a greater and more rapid blood pressure reduction. However, lower initial doses (0.03 to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) titrated slowly have been associated with less reflex tachycardia than have higher initial doses (≥ 0.3 mcg/kg/min). In clinical trials, doses from 0.01 to 1.6 mcg/kg/min have been studied. Most of the effect of a given infusion rate is attained in 15 minutes.\n- Fenoldopam should be administered by continuous intravenous infusion. A bolus dose should not be used. Hypotension and rapid decreases of blood pressure should be avoided. The initial dose should be titrated upward or downward, no more frequently than every 15 minutes (and less frequently as goal pressure is approached) to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The recommended increments for titration are 0.05 to 0.1 mcg/kg/min.\n- Use of a calibrated, mechanical infusion pump is recommended for proper control of infusion rate during fenoldopam infusion. In clinical trials, fenoldopam treatment was safely performed without the need for intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at frequent intervals, typically every 15 minutes. Frequent blood pressure monitoring is recommended.\n- Fenoldopam infusion can be abruptly discontinued or gradually tapered prior to discontinuation. Oral antihypertensive agents can be added during fenoldopam infusion or following its discontinuation. Patients in controlled clinical trials have received intravenous fenoldopam for as long as 48 hours.\n- Warning: contents of ampules must be diluted before infusion. Each ampule is for single use only.\n- Dilution:\n- The fenoldopam injection ampule concentrate must be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, using the following dilution schedule:\n- The drug dose rate must be individualized according to body weight and according to the desired rapidity and extent of pharmacodynamic effect.  provides the calculated infusion volume in mL/hour for a range of drug doses and body weights. The infusion should be administered using a calibrated mechanical infusion pump that can accurately and reliably deliver the desired infusion rate.\n- Infusion rates:\n- The diluted solution is sunder normal ambient light and temperature conditions for at least 24 hours. Diluted solution that is not used within 24 hours of preparation should be discarded. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulate matter or cloudiness is observed, the drug should be discarded.\n\n【5】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【6】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fenoldopam in adult patients.\n\n【7】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- Infusion of 0.1 mcg/kg/min.\n- Dosing information\n0.03 mcg/kg/min infusion administered via central catheter during anesthesia induction. The infusion should be maintained thought all the surgical time and continued until patient stabilization during the postoperative period.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【9】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- Fenoldopam should be administered intravenously to pediatric patients by a continuous infusion pump appropriate for the delivery of low infusion rates.\n be continuously monitored. In the clinical trial, the usual starting dose was 0.2 mcg/kg/min with an effect on MAP evident within 5 minutes. At a constant infusion rate the effect was maximal after 20 to 25 minutes. Increased dosages of up to 0.3 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min every 20 to 30 minutes were generally well tolerated. Tachycardia without further decrease in MAP occurred at dosages greater than 0.8 mcg/kg/min. Upon discontinuation of the fenoldopam infusion after an average of 4 hours of therapy, blood pressure and heart rate returned to near baseline within 30 minutes.\n- Warning: contents of ampules must be diluted before infusion. Each ampule is for single use only.\n- Dilution:\n- below provides the calculated infusion volume in mL/hour for a range of drug doses and body weights. The infusion should be administered using a calibrated mechanical infusion pump that can accurately and reliably deliver the desired infusion rate. As low flow rates (e.g., <0.5 mL/hr) may not be practical, and due to volume overload, it may be necessary to increase the concentration of fenoldopam in the infused solutions.\n- The diluted solution is sunder normal ambient light and temperature conditions for at least 24 hours. Diluted solution that is not used within 24 hours of preparation should be discarded. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulate matter or cloudiness is observed, the drug should be discarded.\n\n【10】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【11】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fenoldopam in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fenoldopam in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- There is limited information provided by the label regarding the contraindications of fenoldopam.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n- Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.\n- Intraocular Pressure: In a clinical study of 12 patients with open-angle glaucoma or intraocular hypertension (mean baseline intraocular pressure was 29.2 mm Hg with a range of 22 to 33 mm Hg), infusion of fenoldopam at escalating doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min over a 3.5 hour period caused a dose-dependent increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). At the peak effect, the intraocular pressure was raised by a mean of 6.5 mm Hg (range -2 to +8.5 mm Hg, corrected for placebo effect). Upon discontinuation of the fenoldopam infusion, the IOP returned to baseline values within 2 hours. Fenoldopam administration to patients with glaucoma or intraocular hypertension should be undertaken with caution.\n- Tachycardia: Fenoldopam causes a dose-related tachycardia  and , particularly with infusion rates above 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Tachycardia in adults diminishes over time but remains substantial at higher doses. Tachycardia in pediatric patients at doses > 0.8 mcg/kg/min persists at least for 4 hours.\n- Hypotension: Fenoldopam may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension and close monitoring of blood pressure during administration is essential. It is particularly important to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or  acute cerebral hemorrhage. In pediatric patients, fenoldopam was only administered to patients with an indwelling intraarterial line.\n- Hypokalemia: Decreases in serum potassium occasionally to values below 3 mEq/L were observed after less than 6 hours of fenoldopam infusion. It is not clear if the hypokalemia reflects a pressure natriuresis with enhanced potassium-sodium exchange or a direct drug effect. During clinical trials, electrolytes were monitored at intervals of 6 hours. Hypokalemia was treated with either oral or intravenous potassium supplementation. Patient management should include appropriate attention to serum electrolytes.\n- Intracranial Pressure: The effect of fenoldopam in the presence of increased intracranial pressure has not been studied.\n\n【15】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【16】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n\n【17】 ### Adult Patients\n- Fenoldopam causes a dose-related fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate. In controlled clinical studies of severe hypertension in patients with end-organ damage, 3% (4/ of patients withdrew because of excessive falls in blood pressure. Increased heart rate could, in theory, lead to ischemic cardiac events or worsened heart failure, although these events have not been observed.\n- The most common events reported as associated with fenoldopam use are headache, cutaneous dilation (flushing), nausea, and hypotension, each reported in more than 5% of patients.\n- Adverse events occurring more than once in any dosing group (once if potentially important or plausibly drug-related) in the fixed-dose constant-infusion studies are presented in the following by infusion-rate group. There was no clear dose relationship, except possibly for headache, nausea, flushing.\n- The adverse event incidences listed below are based on observations of over 1,000 fenoldopam treated adult patients and not listed in the above.\n- Events reported with a frequency between 0.5 to 5% in patients treated with IV fenoldopam:\n- Cardiovascular: Extrasystoles, palpitations, bradycardia, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris.\n- Metabolic: Elevated BUN, elevated serum glucose, elevated transaminase, elevated LDH.\n- General Body: Non-specific chest pain, pyrexia.\n- Hematologic/Lymphatic: Leukocytosis, bleeding.\n- Respiratory: Dyspnea, upper respiratory disorder.\n- Genitourinary: Oliguria.\n- Musculoskeletal: Limb cramp.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Patients\n- In pediatric patients, the most common adverse events reported during short-term administration in controlled trials (30 minutes) were hypotension and tachycardia. However, because of the short exposure, there is limited experience with defining adverse events in children. The long-term effects of fenoldopam on growth and development have not been studied.\n\n【19】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Fenoldopam in the drug label.\n\n【20】 # Drug Interactions\n- Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use of fenoldopam with beta blockers should be avoided. If the drugs are used together, caution should be exercised because unexpected hypotension could result from beta blocker inhibition of the sympathetic reflex response to fenoldopam.\n- There is limited experience with concomitant antihypertensive agents such as alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics (both thiazide-like and loop).\n- Intravenous fenoldopam has been administered safely with drugs such as digitalis and sublingual nitroglycerin.\n\n【21】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【22】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- Oral reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses of 12.5 to 200 mg/kg/day and 6.25 to 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Studies have revealed maternal toxicity at the highest doses tested but no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to fenoldopam. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, fenoldopam should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Fenoldopam in women who are pregnant.\n\n【23】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Fenoldopam during labor and delivery.\n\n【24】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Fenoldopam is excreted in milk in rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fenoldopam is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【25】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Anti-hypertensive effects of fenoldopam have been studied in pediatric patients age < 1 month (at least 2 kg or full term) to 12 years old requiring blood pressure reduction.\n- Clinical studies of fenoldopam did not include subjects ages 12 to 16 years of age to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects or adults. The pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam are independent of age when corrected for body weight. - Dose selection for patients 12 to 16 years of age should consider the patient's clinical condition and concomitant drug therapy.\n\n【26】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of fenoldopam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.\n- Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【27】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fenoldopam with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【28】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fenoldopam with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【29】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fenoldopam in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fenoldopam in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【31】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fenoldopam in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【32】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Fenoldopam in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【33】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【34】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【35】 ### Monitoring\n- Frequent blood pressure monitoring is recommended.\n\n【36】 # IV Compatibility\n- Fenoldopam is compatible with:\n0.9% Sodium Chloride.\n5% Dextrose.\n\n【37】 # Overdosage\n- Intentional fenoldopam overdosage has not been reported. The most likely reaction would be excessive hypotension which should be treated with drug discontinuation and appropriate supportive measures.\n\n【38】 # Pharmacology\n\n【39】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Fenoldopam is a rapid-acting vasodilator. It is an agonist for D1-like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to α2-adrenoceptors. It has no significant affinity for D2-like receptors, α1 and β adrenoceptors, 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, or muscarinic receptors. Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture with the R-isomer responsible for the biological activity. The R-isomer has approximately 250-fold higher affinity for D1-like receptors than does the S-isomer. In non-clinical studies, fenoldopam had no agonist effect on presynaptic D2-like dopamine receptors, or α- or β-adrenoceptors, nor did it affect angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration.\n\n【40】 ## Structure\n- Corlopam (Fenoldopam Mesylate Injection, USP) is a dopamine D1-like receptor agonist. The product is formulated as a solution to be diluted for intravenous infusion. Chemically it is 6-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)--3-benzazepine-7,8-diol methanesulfonate with the following structure:\n- Fenoldopam mesylate is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 401.87 and a molecular formula of C16H16ClNO3CH3SO3H. It is sparingly soluble in water, ethanol and methanol, and is soluble in propylene glycol.\n- Ampules: Each 1 mL contains, in sterile aqueous solution, citric acid 3.44 mg; fenoldopam mesylate equivalent to fenoldopam 10 mg; propylene glycol 518 mg; sodium citrate dihydrate 0.61 mg; sodium metabisulfite 1 mg.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-group study in 32 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 119 mm Hg), and a mean baseline pressure of about 154/98 mm Hg, and heart rate of about 75 bpm, fixed-rate IV infusions of fenoldopam produced dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressures and diastolic blood pressures.\n- In animals, fenoldopam has vasodilating effects in coronary, renal, mesenteric and peripheral arteries. All vascular beds, however, do not respond uniformly to fenoldopam. Vasodilating effects have been demonstrated in renal efferent and afferent arterioles.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Adult Patients: Fenoldopam, administered as a constant infusion at dosages of 0.01 to 1.6 mcg/kg/min, produced steady-state plasma concentrations that were proportional to infusion rates. The elimination half-life was about 5 minutes in mild to moderate hypertensives, with little difference between the R (active) and S isomers. Steady state concentrations are attained in about 20 minutes (4 half-lives). - The steady state plasma concentrations of fenoldopam, at comparable infusion rates, were similar in normotensive patients and in patients with mild to moderate hypertension or hypertensive emergencies.\n- The pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam were not influenced by age, gender, or race in adult patients with a hypertensive emergency. There have been no formal drug-drug interaction studies using intravenous fenoldopam. Clearance of parent (active) fenoldopam is not altered in adult patients with end-stage renal disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and is not altered in adult patients with severe hepatic failure. The effects of hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam have not been evaluated.\n- Pediatric Patients: In children, aged 1 month to 12 years old, steady-state fenoldopam plasma concentrations were proportional to dose (0.05 mcg/kg/min to 3.2 mcg/kg/min). The elimination half-life and clearance were 3 to 5 minutes and 3 L/h/kg, respectively.\n- In radiolabeled studies in rats, no more than 0.005% of fenoldopam crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n- Radiolabeled studies show that about 90% of infused fenoldopam is eliminated in urine, 10% in feces. Elimination is largely by conjugation, without participation of cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The principal routes of conjugation are methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. Only 4% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged. Animal data indicate that the metabolites are inactive.\n\n【43】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- In a 24-month study, mice treated orally with fenoldopam at 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day, reduced to 25 mg/kg/day on day 209 of study, showed no increase above controls in the incidence of neoplasms. Female mice in the highest dose group had an increased incidence and degree of severity of a fibro-osseous lesion of the sternum compared with control or low-dose animals. Compared to controls, female mice in the middle- and upper-dose groups had a higher incidence and degree of severity of chronic nephritis. These pathologic lesions were not seen in male mice treated with fenoldopam.\n- In a 24-month study, rats treated orally with fenoldopam at 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, with the mid- and high-dose groups increased to 15 or 25 mg/kg/day, respectively, on day 372 of the study, showed no increase above controls in the incidence or type of neoplasms. Compared with the controls, rats in the mid- and high-dose groups had a higher incidence of hyperplasia of collecting duct epithelium at the tip of the renal papilla.\n- Fenoldopam did not induce bacterial gene mutation in the Ames test or mammalian gene mutation in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell assay. In the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with CHO cells, fenoldopam was associated with statistically significant and dose-dependent increases in chromosomal aberrations, and in the proportion of aberrant metaphases. However, no chromosomal damage was seen in the in vivo mice micronucleus or bone marrow assays.\n- Oral fertility and general reproduction performance studies in male and female rats at 12.5, 37.5 or 75 mg/kg/day revealed no impairment of fertility or reproduction performance due to fenoldopam.\n- Unusual toxicologic findings (arterial lesions in the rat) with fenoldopam are summarized below. These findings have not been observed in mice or dogs. No evidence of a similar lesion in humans has been observed.\n- Arterial lesions characterized by medial necrosis and hemorrhage have been seen in renal and splanchnic arteries of rats given fenoldopam mesylate by continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 1 to 100 mcg/kg/min for 24 hours. The incidence of these lesions is dose related. Arterial lesions morphologically identical to those observed with fenoldopam have been reported in rats infused with dopamine. Data suggest that the mechanism for this injury involves activation of D1-like dopaminergic receptors. Such lesions have not been seen in dogs given doses up to 100 mcg/kg/min by continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours, nor were they seen in dogs infused at the same dose for 6 hours daily for 24 days. The clinical significance of this finding is not known.\n- Oral administration of fenoldopam doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day or 20 to 25 mg/kg/day to rats for 24 months induced a higher incidence of polyarteritis nodosa compared to controls. Such lesions were not seen in rats given 5 mg/kg/day of fenoldopam or in mice given the drug at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months.\n\n【44】 # Clinical Studies\n- In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-group study in 32 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 119 mm Hg), and a mean baseline pressure of about 154/98 mm Hg, and heart rate of about 75 bpm, fixed-rate IV infusions of fenoldopam produced dose-related reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Infusions were maintained at a fixed rate for 48 hours. The below shows the results of the study. The onset of response was rapid at all infusion rates, with the 15-minute response representing 50 to 100% of the 1 hour response in all groups. There was some suggestion of partial tolerance at 48 hours in the 2 higher dose infusions, but a substantial effect persisted through 48 hours. When infusions were stopped, blood pressure gradually returned to pretreatment values with no evidence of rebound.\n- This study suggests that there is no greater response to 0.8 mcg/kg/min than to 0.4 mcg/kg/min.\n- In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of four infusion rates, fenoldopam was administered as constant rate infusions of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mcg/kg/min for up to 24 hours to 94 adult patients experiencing hypertensive emergencies (defined as diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg with evidence of compromise of end-organ function involving the cardiovascular, renal, cerebral or retinal systems). Infusion rates could be doubled after one hour if clinically indicated. There were dose-related, rapid-onset, decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and increases in heart rate.\n- Two hundred thirty-six  severely hypertensive adult patients (DBP ≥ 120 mm Hg), with or without end-organ compromise, were randomized to receive in 2 open-label studies either fenoldopam or nitroprusside. The response rate was 79% (92/ in the fenoldopam group and 77% (90/ in the nitroprusside group. Response required a decline in supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mm Hg if the baseline were between 120 and 150 mm Hg, inclusive, or by ≥ 40 mm Hg if the baseline were ≥ 150 mm Hg. Patients were titrated to the desired effect. For fenoldopam, the dose ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 mcg/kg/min; for nitroprusside, the dose ranged from 1 to 8 mcg/kg/min. As in the study in mild to moderate hypertensives, most of the effect seen at 1 hour is present at 15 minutes. The additional effect seen after 1 hour occurs in all groups and may not be drug-related (there was no placebo group for evaluation).\n- In a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, pediatric patients were randomized in equal proportions to 1 of 5 treatment groups: 0.05, 0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mcg/kg/min fenoldopam or placebo. Fenoldopam or placebo was administered as a blinded continuous IV infusion for 30 minutes. Following this, open-label titration of fenoldopam was given to induce hypotension or normotension (defined as mean arterial pressure, MAP, between 50 and 80 mmHg for patients > 1 month of age and MAP between 40 and 70 mmHg for patients ≤ 1 month). Seventy-seven pediatric patients (up to 12 years of age – Tanner Stages 1 and  were treated for at least two hours. Of these, 2 were < 1 month of age, 25 were between 1 month of age and 1 year of age, 7 were between 1 and 2 years of age, and 43 were between 2 and 12 years of age. Of the 77 patients enrolled in the trial, 58 were enrolled in association with surgery, and 19 were treated in an ICU setting.\n- The lowest dosage at which decreases in MAP were seen during blinded administration was 0.2 mcg/kg/min. The dose at which the maximum effect was seen was 0.8 mcg/kg/min. - Doses higher than 0.8 mcg/kg/min generally produced no further decreases in MAP but did worsen tachycardia .

However, the exact mechanisms causing febrile episodes remain to be cleared.\n- Another hypotheses is that mutation in the gene results in intracellular accumulation of the receptor. This abnormal accumulation of the receptor leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response to low levels of innate stimuli such as  lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n\n【5】 # Differentiating TNFreceptorassociatedperiodicsyndromefrom Other Diseases\n- TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases that cause fever, abdominal pain, and arthritis, such as infections, other autoinflammatory diseases, and autoimmune disorders.\n- \n\n【6】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- This disorder is the second most common inflammatory disorder after familial mediterranean fever (FMF).\n- The incidence/prevalence of TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome is approximately 0.06 per 100,000 individuals of 16 years of age or younger worldwide.\n- Approximately, 1000 cases have been reported worldwide.\n- TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome commonly affects individuals of 3 years of age. However, due to overlap of the symptoms with other disorders and possible misdiagnosis, it may be diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood. In addition, the variants with low penetrance tend to manifest later in the adult life.\n- Although more common in children, reports of patients developing TRAPS in old age are available.\n been reported in other countries. However, it is especially common in Western countries rather than Asian countries.\n\n【7】 # Risk Factors\n- There are no established risk factors for TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【8】 # Screening\n- There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【9】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n- The clinically important complication of TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome is amyloidosis which results from the continuous elevation of serum amyloid A (SAA).\n- It is estimated that 10-20% of the individuals with TRAPS may develop amyloidosis.\n- Mutations involving cysteine substitution are more commonly associated with amyloidosis.\n\n【10】 # Diagnosis\n\n【11】 # Diagnostic Studyof Choice\n- Diagnosis is based on the clinical features. In 2017, Eurofever registry developed a set of criteria for the diagnosis of the four major periodic fever syndromes. below is the diagnostic criteria for TRAPS.\n- The cut-off value for the diagnosis of TRAPS is score equal or higher than 43 scores.\n- The overall sensitivity and specificity of this set of criteria for the diagnosis of this disorder is 59% and 84%, respectively.\n- The gold standard diagnostic study for TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome is the genetic analysis.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\n- The hallmark of TNF-a receptor-associated periodic syndrome is recurrent fever episodes lasting 1 to 4 weeks or more. Fever is accompanied by other symptoms including but not limited to skin rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, puffy eyes (due to periorbital edema), migrating muscle and joint pain, and erythema of the eye.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\n- Common physical examination findings of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome include fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly.\n- Cutaneous manifestations of TRAPS include an erythematous rash that overlies an area with myalgia, erysipelas-like erythema, and urticaria.\n- Eye involvement is characteristics for this disease among other autoinflammatory diseases and may manifest with conjunctivitis, periorbital edema, and uveitis.\n be present.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- An elevated concentration of blood acute phase reactants are observed both during and in between inflammatory attacks.\n been reported.\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\n- There are no ECG findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【16】 ## X-ray\n- There are no x-ray findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\n- There are no echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\n- There are no CT scan findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n- However, para-aortic and mesenteric lymphadenopathies have been reported in one case.\n\n【19】 # MRI\n- There are no MRI findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【20】 # Other Imaging Findings\n- There are no other imaging findings associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【21】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n- There are no other diagnostic studies associated with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【22】 # Treatment\n\n【23】 ## Medical Therapy\n- Several medications have been studied for the treatment of TRAPS including high dose corticosteroids, etanercept, and infliximab.\n- Response to the aforementioned treatment options reported to be different in different cases.\n- Etanercept has been reported to effectively reduce the severity of attacks as well as the risk of amyloidosis development.\n\n【24】 ## Surgery\n- Surgical intervention is not recommended for the management of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【25】 ## Primary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the primary prevention of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.\n\n【26】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#14#14#in between inflammatory attacks\nbeen reported.是一句话", "type3": "无关文本#3#3#be present.", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:18", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:45:12"}

There is a Black Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include decreased renal function, diarrhea, hypertension, headache, nausea, vomiting and hypotension.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【5】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n- Indication\n- Plazomicin is indicated in patients 18 years of age or older for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganism(s): Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae.\n- As only limited clinical safety and efficacy data for plazomicin are currently available, reserve plazomicin for use in cUTI patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options.\n- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of plazomicin and other antibacterial drugs, plazomicin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n- Dosage\n- Administer plazomicin 15 mg/kg every 24 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes to patients 18 years of age or older with creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 90 mL/min.\n- Recommended duration of treatment is 4 to 7 days for cUTI, including pyelonephritis.\n\n【6】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【7】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding plazomicin Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n\n【8】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding plazomicin Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【10】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- The safety and effectiveness of plazomicin in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【11】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【12】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding plazomicin Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【13】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding plazomicin Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\n- Plazomicin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Nephrotoxicity has been reported with the use of plazomicin. Most serum creatinine increases were ≤ 1 mg/dL above baseline and reversible.\n- In Trial 1, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with renal function (acute kidney injury, serum creatinine increased, chronic kidney disease, creatinine clearance decreased, renal failure, renal impairment) was 3.6% (11/ in plazomicin-treated patients compared with 1.3% (4/ in meropenem-treated patients.\n- Serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline occurred in 7% (21/ of plazomicin-treated patients compared with 4% (12/ of meropenem-treated patients. These increases mainly occurred in patients with CLcr ≤ 90 mL/min and were associated with a plazomicin trough level (Cmin) greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL.\n- Assess CLcr in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy with plazomicin, particularly in those at increased risk of nephrotoxicity, such as those with renal impairment, the elderly, and those receiving concomitant potentially nephrotoxic medications. In the setting of worsening renal function, the benefit of continuing plazomicin should be assessed.\n- Adjust the initial dosage regimen in cUTI patients with CLcr ≥ 15 mL/min and < 60 mL/min. For subsequent doses, TDM is recommended for patients with CLcr ≥15 mL/min and < 90 mL/min.\n- Ototoxicity, manifested as hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo, has been reported with plazomicin. Symptoms of aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity may be irreversible and may not become evident until after completion of therapy.\n- Regarding the incidence of adverse reactions associated with cochlear or vestibular function, in Trial 1, there was one case of reversible hypoacusis (1/303;0.3%) in plazomicin-treated patients and one case of tinnitus (1/301;0.3%) in meropenem-treated patients. In Trial 2, one case each of irreversible tinnitus and reversible vertigo was reported in plazomicin-treated patients, and one case of an abnormal audiogram occurred in a levofloxacin-treated patient.\n- Aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity has been observed primarily in patients with a family history of hearing loss (excluding age-related hearing loss), patients with renal impairment, and in patients receiving higher doses and/or for longer periods than recommended. In Trial 1 and Trial 2, patients with a history of hearing loss, with the exception of age-related hearing loss, were excluded. The benefit-risk of plazomicin therapy should be considered in these patients.\n- Aminoglycosides have been associated with exacerbation of muscle weakness in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, or delay in recovery of neuromuscular function in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents.\n- During therapy with plazomicin, monitor for adverse reactions associated with neuromuscular blockade, particularly in high-risk patients, such as patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders (including myasthenia gravis) or those patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.\n- Aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use plazomicin during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking plazomicin should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n- Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with plazomicin is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other aminoglycosides should be made. A history of hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides is a contraindication to the use of plazomicin, because cross-sensitivity among aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue plazomicin if an allergic reaction occurs.\n- Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.\n- C. difficile produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs.\n- If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated.\n- Prescribing plazomicin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- Plazomicin was evaluated in two comparator-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1, NCT02486627 and Trial 2, NCT in patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis. In both trials, patients with CLcr greater than 60 mL/min received plazomicin 15 mg/kg IV once daily as a 30-minute infusion.\n- Trial 1 included 303 patients treated with plazomicin and 301 patients treated with meropenem. Patients were to receive 4 to 7 days of plazomicin (mean duration of 5.1 days). In some patients, parenteral therapy was followed by a switch to an oral antibacterial drug.\n- The median age of patients treated with plazomicin in Trial 1 was 62 years (range 18 to 90 years) and 45.2% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients treated with plazomicin were predominantly female (56.1%) and White (99.3%). A majority of patients (68.0%) had mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr >30 to 90 mL/min) at baseline. Patients with CLcr of 30 mL/min or less were excluded.\n- Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuations in Trial 1\n- In Trial 1, treatment discontinuation from IV study drug due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.0% of patients receiving plazomicin (6/ and meropenem (6/, respectively.\n- Common Adverse Reactions in Trial 1\n-  lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or more of patients receiving plazomicin in Trial 1.\n- The adverse reactions profile for the cUTI patients in Trial 2 were similar to those observed in Trial 1.\n- Nephrotoxicity Reported in Trial 1\n- In Trial 1, serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline occurred in 7.0% (21/ of plazomicin-treated patients compared with 4.0% (12/ of meropenem-treated patients. Of these, the incidence during IV therapy was 3.7% (11/ vs 3.0% (9/ in plazomicin- and meropenem-treated patients, respectively. By the last follow-up visit (between 8 to 43 days after completion of IV therapy), the majority of plazomicin-treated patients (9/ and all meropenem treated patients (9/ with serum creatinine increases while on therapy had fully recovered renal function. Serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline were observed following completion of IV therapy. These increases were generally ≤ 1.0 mg/dL above baseline and recovered by the next measurement.\n- In cUTI patients with CLcr of greater than 30 and less than or equal to 90 mL/min, 9.7% (20/ plazomicin-treated and 4.1% (9/ meropenem-treated patients had serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline. In cUTI patients with CLcr greater than 90 mL/min, 1.1% (1/ plazomicin-treated and 3.8% (3/ of meropenem-treated patients had serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline.\n- Ototoxicity\n- Pure tone audiometry was evaluated in Phase 1 trials and in Trial 2. Treatment associated ototoxicity could not be definitively excluded according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria1 in 2.2% (4/ of plazomicin-exposed and 2.0% (1/ of comparator- or placebo-exposed adults.\n- Other Adverse Reactions Reported with plazomicin\n- The following selected adverse reactions were reported in more than one plazomicin-treated patient in Trials 1 and 2 and are not described elsewhere in the labeling:\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, gastritis\n- Laboratory Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased\n- Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypokalemia\n- Nervous system disorders: dizziness\n- Renal and urinary disorders: hematuria\n- Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Plazomicin Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\n- There is limited information regarding Plazomicin Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【20】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Risk Summary\n- Aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of plazomicin in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Published literature reports of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, state that it can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. No drug-related visceral or skeletal malformations were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered subcutaneous plazomicin during organogenesis at maternal exposures approximately 0.8-fold (rats) and 2.5-fold (rabbits) of the human AUC at the clinical dose of 15 mg/kg/day. Auditory function of offspring was not measured in animal studies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\n- The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n- Animal Data\n- In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, plazomicin doses of 0, 8, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day administered subcutaneously during organogenesis did not cause drug-related visceral or skeletal malformations, or reduce survival of fetuses. The mid and high doses caused maternal toxicity (reductions in food consumption and body weight gain; increased kidney weight). The high dose resulted in maternal exposure (AUC) approximately 0.8-fold the human AUC at the clinical dose of 15 mg/kg once daily.\n- In an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, plazomicin administered subcutaneously at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 50 mg/kg/day did not cause visceral or skeletal malformations or reduced fetal survival. At the high dose, significant maternal toxicity was observed (including renal injury and lethality) and exposure was approximately 2.5-fold the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose.\n- In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, maternal animals received subcutaneous plazomicin at 0, 3, 8, or 30 mg/kg/day from the start of organogenesis through lactation. There were no adverse effects on maternal function or pre- and postnatal survival, development, behavior, or reproductive function of the offspring at up to 30 mg/kg/day (0.32-fold human AUC at the clinical daily dose of 15 mg/kg).\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Plazomicin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Plazomicin during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Risk Summary\n- There are no data on the presence of plazomicin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Plazomicin was detected in rat milk . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for plazomicin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from plazomicin or from the underlying maternal condition.\n- Data\n- In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, low concentrations of plazomicin in maternal milk were detected, with mean concentrations representing 2% to 4% of maternal plasma concentrations. In nursing pups, the systemic exposure (AUC) to plazomicin through lactational exposure was approximately 0.04% of maternal systemic exposure.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of plazomicin in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the 425 patients treated with plazomicin in Trials 1 and 2, 40% (170/ were 65 years of age and older, including 17.2% (73/ patients 75 years of age and older. In Trial 1, for plazomicin- treated patients ≥ 65 years old, the incidence rate of adverse reactions was 27% (37/ versus 18.9% (27/ in the meropenem-treated patients ≥ 65 years old. For plazomicin- treated patients < 65 years old, the incidence rate of adverse reactions was 13.3% (22/ versus 24.1% (38/ in the meropenem-treated patients < 65 years old.\n- The rate of adverse reactions associated with renal function for the plazomicin-treated patients ≥ 65 years old was 6.6% (9/ versus 2.8% (4/ in the meropenem-treated patients. For plazomicin- treated patients < 65 years old, the incidence rate of adverse reactions associated with renal function was 1.2% (2/, versus 0% (0/ in the meropenem-treated patients.\n- Plazomicin is substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of adverse reactions to plazomicin may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored. Dosage adjustment in elderly patients should take into account renal function and plazomicin concentrations as appropriate.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Plazomicin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Plazomicin with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Plazomicin total body clearance was significantly decreased in patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 15 to less than 60 mL/min compared to patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. Monitor CLcr daily and adjust plazomicin dosage accordingly. There is insufficient information to recommend a dosage regimen in patients with CLcr less than 15 mL/min or on renal replacement therapy, including hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy.\n- For patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 15 mL/min and less than 90 mL/min, TDM is recommended. Monitor plazomicin trough concentrations and adjust plazomicin dosage accordingly.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Plazomicin in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【30】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Plazomicin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Plazomicin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\n- Recommended Dosage\n- The recommended dosage regimen of plazomicin is 15 mg/kg administered every 24 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes in patients 18 years of age or older and with creatinine clearance (CLcr) greater than or equal to 90 mL/min . The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity of infection and the patient's clinical status for up to 7 days. During treatment, dosage adjustments may be required based on change in renal function.\n- Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment\n- The recommended initial dosage regimen of plazomicin in adult patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 15 and less than 90 mL/min, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, is described in \n- Patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 15 and less than 90 mL/min receiving plazomicin may require subsequent dosage adjustments based on change in renal function and/or Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) as appropriate.\n- There is insufficient information to recommend a dosage regimen in patients with CLcr less than 15 mL/min or on renal replacement therapy, including hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy.\n- TDM in cUTI Patients With Renal Impairment\n- For cUTI patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 15 mL/min and less than 90 mL/min, TDM is recommended to maintain plasma trough concentrations below 3 mcg/mL. Measure plazomicin plasma trough concentration within approximately 30 minutes before administration of the second dose of plazomicin. Adjustment of the plazomicin dosage regimen based on TDM involves extending plazomicin dosing interval by 1.5 fold (i.e., from every 24 hours to every 36 hours or from every 48 hours to every 72 hours) for patients with plasma trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL.\n- Preparation of Diluted Solutions of plazomicin\n- Plazomicin is supplied as a single-dose fliptop 10-mL vial that contains plazomicin sulfate equivalent to 500 mg plazomicin freebase in 10 mL Water for Injection (concentration of 50 mg/mL). The appropriate volume of plazomicin solution (50 mg/mL) for the required dose should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP to achieve a final volume of 50 mL for intravenous infusion. The stability of plazomicin solution in the compatible diluents is described below.\n- Plazomicin does not contain preservatives. Aseptic technique must be followed in preparing the infusion solution. Discard unused portion of the plazomicin vial.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n- Stability of plazomicin Solution in Intravenous Fluids\n- After dilution, plazomicin solution for administration is sfor 24 hours at room temperature at concentrations of 2.5 mg/mL to 45 mg/mL in the following solutions:\n0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP\n- Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP\n- Drug Compatibility\n- Compatibility of plazomicin for administration with other drugs has not been established. Plazomicin should not be mixed with other drugs or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. Other medications should not be infused simultaneously with plazomicin through the same IV line.\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\n- Monitoring of Renal Function\n- Assess creatinine clearance in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy with plazomicin.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\n- Plazomicin is administered by intravenous infusion.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\n- In the event of overdosage, plazomicin should be discontinued and supportive care is advised. Maintenance of glomerular filtration and careful monitoring of renal function is recommended. Hemodialysis may aid in the removal of plazomicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. No clinical information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat plazomicin overdosage.\n\n【37】 # Pharmacology\n\n【38】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Plazomicin is an antibacterial drug.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\n- Plazomicin contains plazomicin sulfate, a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibacterial derived from sisomicin.\n- Plazomicin sulfate contains a theoretical 2.5 molar equivalents of sulfate relative to the freebase, based on complete protonation. The molecular weight of plazomicin sulfate is calculated based on 1:2.5 stoichiometry. The corresponding empirical formula is C25H48N6O10∙2.5 H2SO4 (plazomicin sulfate) and the molecular weight of the plazomicin sulfate salt is 837.89 g/mol and the molecular weight of the freebase is 592.69 g/mol.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The ratio of area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) for plazomicin has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection against Enterobacteriaceae.\n- Exposure- Response Relationship for Nephrotoxicity in cUTI Patients\n- Based on exposure-response analysis for nephrotoxicity, defined as serum creatinine increases greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline, using the data from two cUTI clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial , development of nephrotoxicity was associated with estimated plazomicin exposure (i.e., the plasma trough concentration ) in patients with CLcr greater than 30 mL/min and less than or equal to 90 mL/min (N=. The incidence of nephrotoxicity was higher in patients with plazomicin Cmin greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL (36%, 10/ compared to patients with plazomicin Cmin less than 3 mcg/mL (5%, 11/.\n- Cardiac Electrophysiology\n- The effect of plazomicin on the QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo and positive controlled, double-blind, single-dose, crossover thorough QTc study in 56 healthy adult subjects. At a single dose of 20 mg/kg (1.3 times the maximum recommended dose), plazomicin did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of plazomicin are similar for single- and multiple-dose administration of plazomicin in healthy subjects. No appreciable accumulation of plazomicin was observed following multiple IV infusions of 15 mg/kg administered every 24 hours in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and Cmin increased in proportion to the dose over the dose range of 4 to 15 mg/kg. The plazomicin AUC, Cmax, and Cmin are summarized in \n- Distribution\n- The mean (±SD) volume of distribution of plazomicin in healthy adults and cUTI patients is 17.9 (±4. and 30.8 (±12. L, respectively. The average binding of plazomicin to human plasma proteins is approximately 20%. The degree of protein binding was concentration-independent across the range tested in vitro (5 to 100 mcg/mL).\n- Elimination\n- The mean (±SD) total body clearance of plazomicin in healthy adults and cUTI patients is 4.5 (±0. and 5.1 (±2. L/h, respectively. The mean (±SD) half-life of plazomicin was 3.5 h (±0. in healthy adults with normal renal function (n=.\n- Metabolism\n- Plazomicin does not appear to be metabolized to any appreciable extent.\n- Excretion\n- Plazomicin is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Following a single 15 mg/kg IV dose of radiolabeled plazomicin in healthy subjects, 56% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered in urine within 4 hours, 89.1% was recovered within 168 hours, with less than 0.2% in feces. In total, 97.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged plazomicin. The mean renal clearance (±SD) of plazomicin (4.6  L/h) was similar to total body clearance, suggesting that plazomicin is eliminated by the kidneys.\n- Specific Populations\n- No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of plazomicin were observed based on age (18 to 90 years of age), sex, or race/ethnicity. The pharmacokinetics of plazomicin in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown.\n- Patients with Renal Impairment\n- Following a single 7.5 mg/kg IV dose (0.5 times the recommended dose) of plazomicin as a 30-minute infusion, the geometric mean AUC0-inf of plazomicin in subjects with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=, moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=, and severe (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min, n= renal impairment was 1.01-fold, 1.98-fold, and 4.42-fold higher, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr ≥90 mL/min, n=.\n- Based on the population PK model, the recommended dosage of plazomicin was associated with a mean (±SD) Cmin of 1.0 (±1. and 1.7 (±1. mcg/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n= and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n= renal impairment, respectively. The mean (±SD) area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) was 261 (± and 224 (± mcg∙h/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n= and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n= renal impairment, respectively. There were insufficient data to calculate Cmin and AUC0-24h for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min).\n- Geriatric Patients\n- No clinically relevant trend in plazomicin exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) was observed with regard to age alone. Higher Cmin in elderly subjects (65 to 90 years of age) as compared to non-elderly adult subjects (18 to 64 years of age) was mainly attributo age-related changes in renal function.\n- Drug Interaction Studies\n- Clinical Studies\n- Based on the results of a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study that evaluated the effect of a single dose of plazomicin (15 mg/kg) on the single dose plasma PK of metformin, plazomicin did not affect the PK of metformin, which is a substrate of OCT and MATE transporters.\n- In Vitro Studies\n- Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes\n- Plazomicin does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 isoforms: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. Plazomicin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4.\n- Membrane Transporters\n- Plazomicin is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP transporters. Plazomicin does not inhibit the following hepatic and renal transporters in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations: P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2. Plazomicin selectively inhibited the MATE1 and MATE2-K renal transporter in vitro with an IC50 value of 1300 and 338 mcg/mL, respectively.\n\n【42】 ## Microbiology\n- Mechanism of Action\n- Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside that acts by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Plazomicin has concentration-dependent bactericidal activity as measured by time kill studies. In vitro studies demonstrated a plazomicin post-antibiotic effect ranging from 0.2 to 2.6 hours at 2× MIC against Enterobacteriaceae.\n- Resistance\n- Resistance to aminoglycosides includes production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs), alteration of the ribosomal target through production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases, up-regulation of efflux pumps and reduced permeability into bacterial cell due to loss of outer membrane porins.\n- Plazomicin is not inhibited by most AMEs known to affect gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin, including acetyltransferases (AACs), phosphotransferases (APHs) and nucleotidyltransferases (ANTs). Plazomicin, like other aminoglycosides, is inactive against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. Plazomicin may have reduced activity against Enterobacteriaceae that overexpress certain efflux pumps (e.g., acrAB-tolC) or lower expression of porins (e.g., ompF or ompK.\n- Plazomicin has no in vitro activity against streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumonia), enterococci (including Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium), anaerobes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp and variable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n- Activity of plazomicin was demonstrated in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of certain beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, AmpC), serine carbapenemases (KPC-2, KPC-, and oxacillinase (OXA-. Bacteria producing metallo-beta-lactamases often co-express 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to plazomicin.\n- Interaction With Other Antimicrobials\n- In vitro studies have demonstrated that against Enterobacteriaceae isolates, no antagonism was observed for plazomicin in combination with clindamycin, colistin, daptomycin, fosfomycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, rifampin, tigecycline and vancomycin; few isolates showed synergy with ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n- Animal Infection Models\n- Plazomicin demonstrated activity in animal models of infection (e.g., thigh infection, lung infection, and septicemia) caused by either amikacin-non-susceptible, gentamicin-non-susceptible, or beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n- Antimicrobial Activity\n- Plazomicin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n- Aerobic Bacteria\n- Gram-negative Bacteria\n- Escherichia coli\n- Klebsiella pneumoniae\n- Proteus mirabilis\n- Enterobacter cloacae\n- The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for plazomicin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of plazomicin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.\n- Citrobacter freundii\n- Citrobacter koseri\n- Enterobacter aerogenes\n- Klebsiella oxytoca\n- Morganella morganii\n- Proteus vulgaris\n- Providencia stuartii\n- Serratia marcescens\n\n【43】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis\n- Long term carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been conducted with plazomicin.\n- Mutagenesis\n- Plazomicin was negative for mutagenicity in an Ames test and did not induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In vivo, a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay showed no evidence of clastogenic potential.\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- In a fertility and early embryonic development study, male and female rats received subcutaneous plazomicin at 0, 8, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day from prior to pairing through the mating and postmating period. Parental toxicity (reduced food consumption and body weight gain, and gross kidney changes) was observed at the mid and high doses. Plazomicin had no adverse effects on fertility in male rats at up to 50 mg/kg/day, resulting in an exposure (AUC) approximately 0.8-fold the human AUC at the clinical dose of 15 mg/kg once daily. In female rats, there were no effects on estrous cyclicity or reproductive performance including mating indices, fertility and fecundity indices, and copulatory intervals. At 25 and 50 mg/kg/day, female rats had fewer corpora lutea, leading to fewer uterine implantation sites and viable embryos per dam. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for fertility and reproductive performance in female rats was 8 mg/kg/day (0.1-fold human AUC).\n\n【44】 # Clinical Studies\n- A total of 609 adults hospitalized with cUTI (including pyelonephritis) were randomized in a multinational, double-blind, noninferiority trial comparing plazomicin (15 mg/kg IV once daily as a 30-minute infusion) to meropenem (1 g intravenously every 8 hours as a 30-minute infusion) (Trial 1, NCT. Switch to an oral antibacterial drug, such as levofloxacin, was allowed after a minimum of 4 and maximum of 7 days of IV therapy for a total of 7 to 10 days of treatment.\n- Efficacy was assessed in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population, which included all patients who received study medication and had at least 1 baseline uropathogen. The mMITT population excluded patients with organisms resistant to study drugs. Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups in the mMITT population. The mMITT population consisted of 388 patients with cUTI, including 162 (41.8%) with pyelonephritis. The median age was 64 years, 52.8% were female and 99.5% were White. The majority of the patients (99%) were from Eastern Europe; 3 patients were from the United States. Concomitant bacteremia was identified in 25 (13.1%) and 23 (11.7%) patients at baseline in the plazomicin and meropenem groups, respectively. The median treatment duration of IV study drug was 6 days in both groups.\n- Plazomicin demonstrated efficacy for composite cure at Day 5 and the Test of Cure (TOC) visit . Composite cure at Day 5 was defined as resolution or improvement of clinical cUTI symptoms and a microbiological outcome of eradication (all baseline uropathogens reduced to <104 colony-forming units /mL). Composite cure at the TOC visit (Day 17 ± 2 from the first dose of study drug) was defined as resolution of clinical cUTI symptoms and a microbiological outcome of eradication.\n- Microbiological eradication rates at the TOC visit by baseline uropathogen in the mMITT population are presented in  Composite Cure at the TOC visit in individuals with concomitant bacteremia at baseline was achieved in 72.0% (18/ of patients in the plazomicin group and 56.5% (13/ of patients in the meropenem group.\n- There were 52 baseline Enterobacteriaceae isolates in 51/189 (27%) patients in the plazomicin group that were non-susceptible (defined as intermediate or resistant) to gentamicin, or tobramycin or both. All of these isolates were susceptible to plazomicin and all but one was susceptible to amikacin (one isolate was intermediate to amikacin). The microbiological eradication rate at the TOC visit in this subset was 78.9% (41/ in the plazomicin group. Note that certain resistance mechanisms can confer resistance to all aminoglycosides, including plazomicin.\n\n【45】 # How Supplied\n- Plazomicin injection 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL) is supplied in single-dose, 10-mL vials fitted with flip-off seals with royal blue polypropylene buttons as a clear, colorless to yellow, sterile solution. Each vial contains plazomicin sulfate equivalent to 500 mg plazomicin freebase at a concentration of 50 mg/mL plazomicin in Water for Injection. Each vial contains sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment to 6.5. The solution may become yellow in color; this does not indicate a decrease in potency.\n\n【46】 ## Storage\n- Store plazomicin injection 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL) refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).\n\n【47】 # Images\n\n【48】 ## Drug Images\n\n【49】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n\n【50】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Nephrotoxicity\n- Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that nephrotoxicity has been reported with plazomicin therapy. Counsel patients to follow their physician's directions regarding renal function laboratory tests, maintenance of adequate hydration, and avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic agents while receiving plazomicin therapy.\n- Ototoxicity\n- Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus have been reported with plazomicin therapy. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they experience changes in hearing or balance, or if they experience new onset or changes in preexisting buzzing or roaring in their ear(s), even if it occurs after the completion of plazomicin therapy.\n- Aggravation of Neuromuscular Disorders\n- Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that aggravation of muscle weakness has been reported for other aminoglycosides, particularly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disease or receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they have an underlying neuromuscular disorder such as myasthenia gravis or are receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.\n- Fetal Harm\n- Aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Counsel women of childbearing potential about the potential risk of fetal harm if plazomicin is used during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women that aminoglycosides can cause irreversible congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman. Tell women of childbearing potential to notify their prescribing physician/ healthcare provider if they become pregnant during plazomicin treatment.\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions\n- Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment. Ask them about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to plazomicin or other aminoglycosides.\n- Potentially Serious Diarrhea\n- Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including plazomicin. Sometimes, frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection. If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, tell patient to contact his or her healthcare provider.\n- Antibacterial Resistance\n- Counsel patients, their families, or caregivers that antibacterial drugs, including plazomicin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When plazomicin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may  decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and  increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treaby plazomicin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n\n【51】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Plazomicin interaction has not been established.

The lower the p-value, the less likely the event would occur by chance alone.\n\n【2】 # Coin flipping example\n less favorable to the null hypothesis of a fair coin) or landing on tails at most 6 times out of 20 flips. In this case the random variable T has a binomial distribution. The probability that 20 flips of a fair coin would result in 14 or more heads is 0.0577. Since this is a two-tailed test, the probability that 20 flips of the coin would result in 14 or more heads or 6 or less heads is 0.0577 x 2 = 0.115.\n- Generally, the smaller the p-value, the more people there are who would be willing to say that the results came from a biased coin.\n\n【3】 # Interpretation\n- Generally, one rejects the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than or equal to the significance level, often represented by the Greek letter α (alpha).  If the level is 0.05, then the results are only 5% likely to be as extraordinary as just seen, given that the null hypothesis is true.\n- In the above example, the calculated p-value exceeds 0.05, and thus the null hypothesis - that the observed result of 14 heads out of 20 flips can be ascribed to chance alone - is not rejected. Such a finding is often stated as being \"not statistically significant at the 5% level\".\n- However, had a single extra head been obtained, the resulting p-value would be 0.02. This time the null hypothesis - that the observed result of 15 heads out of 20 flips can be ascribed to chance alone - is rejected. Such a finding would be described as being \"statistically significant at the 5% level\".\n- Critics of p-values point out that the criterion used to decide \"statistical significance\" is based on the somewhat arbitrary choice of level (often set at 0 A proposed replacement for the p-value is p-rep.\n\n【4】 # Frequent misunderstandings\n- There are several common misunderstandings about p-values.\n- The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true (claimed to justify the \"rule\" of considering as significant p-values closer to 0 (zero)).\n- In fact, frequentist statistics does not, and cannot, attach probabilities to hypotheses. Comparison of Bayesian and classical approaches shows that a p-value can be very close to zero while the posterior probability of the null is very close to unity. This is the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.\n- The p-value is not the probability that a finding is \"merely a fluke\" (again, justifying the \"rule\" of considering small p-values as \"significant\").\n- As the calculation of a p-value is based on the assumption that a finding is the product of chance alone, it patently cannot simultaneously be used to gauge the probability of that assumption being true.\n- The p-value is not the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis.  This error is a version of the so-called prosecutor's fallacy.\n- The p-value is not the probability that a replicating experiment would not yield the same conclusion.\n1 − (p-value) is not the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true ).\n- The significance level of the test is not determined by the p-value.\n- The significance level of a test is a value that should be decided upon by the agent interpreting the data before the data are viewed, and is compared against the p-value or any other statistic calculated after the test has been performed.\n- The p-value does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect (compare with effect size).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 20:03:31"}

Common adverse reactions include irritability, feeding problem symptom.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【4】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n- Caffeine citrate injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of apnea of prematurity in infants between 28 and < 33 weeks gestational age.\n- Prior to initiation of caffeine citrate injection, baseline serum levels of caffeine should be measured in infants previously treated with theophylline, since preterm infants metabolize theophylline to caffeine.  Likewise, baseline serum levels of caffeine should be measured in infants born to mothers who consumed caffeine prior to delivery, since caffeine readily crosses the placenta.\n- The recommended loading dose and maintenance doses of caffeine citrate follow.\n- NOTE THAT THE DOSE OF CAFFEINE BASE IS ONE-HALF THE DOSE WHEN EXPRESSED AS CAFFEINE CITRATE (e.g., 20 mg of caffeine citrate is equivalent to 10 mg of caffeine base).\n- Serum concentrations of caffeine may need to be monitored periodically throughout treatment to avoid toxicity.  Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg/L.\n- Caffeine citrate injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  Vials containing discolored solution or visible particulate matter should be discarded.\n- To test for drug compatibility with common intravenous solutions or medications, 20 mL of caffeine citrate injection were combined with 20 mL of a solution or medication, with the exception of an Intralipid admixture, which was combined as 80 mL/80 mL.  The physical appearance of the combined solutions was evaluated for precipitation.  The admixtures were mixed for 10 minutes and then assayed for caffeine.  The admixtures were then continually mixed for 24 hours, with further sampling for caffeine assays at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours.\n- Based on this testing, caffeine citrate injection, 60 mg/3 mL is chemically sfor 24 hours at room temperature when combined with the following test products.\n- Dextrose Injection, USP 5%\n50% Dextrose Injection USP\n- Intralipid 20% IV Fat Emulsion\n- Aminosyn 8.5% Crystalline Amino Acid Solution\n- Dopamine HCI Injection, USP 40 mg/mL diluted to 0.6 mg/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5%\n- Calcium Gluconate Injection, USP 10% (0.465 mEq/Ca+2/mL)\n- Heparin Sodium Injection, USP 1,000 units/mL diluted to 1 unit/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5%\n- Fentanyl Citrate Injection, USP 50 mcg/mL diluted to 10 mcg/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5%\n\n【5】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【6】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【7】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【9】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【11】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- Caffeine citrate is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to any of its components.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n- During the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, six cases of necrotizing enterocolitis developed among the 85 infants studied (caffeine=46, placebo=, with three cases resulting in death.  Five of the six patients with necrotizing enterocolitis were randomized to or had been exposed to caffeine citrate.\n- Reports in the published literature have raised a question regarding the possible association between the use of methylxanthines and development of necrotizing enterocolitis, although a causal relationship between methylxanthine use and necrotizing enterocolitis has not been established.  Therefore, as with all preterm infants, patients being treated with caffeine citrate should be carefully monitored for the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n【15】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【16】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Caffeine citrate (injection) Clinical Trials Experience in the drug label.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Overall, the reported number of adverse events in the double-blind period of the controlled trial was similar for the caffeine citrate and placebo groups.  The following shows adverse events that occurred in the double-blind period of the controlled trial and that were more frequent in caffeine citrate treated patients than placebo.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\n- There is limited information regarding Caffeine citrate (injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Concern for the teratogenicity of caffeine is not relevant when administered to infants.  In studies performed in adult animals, caffeine (as caffeine base) administered to pregnant mice as sustained release pellets at 50 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended intravenous loading dose for infants on a mg/m2 basis), during the period of organogenesis, caused a low incidence of cleft palate and exencephaly in the fetuses.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Caffeine citrate (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【21】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Caffeine citrate (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【22】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【23】 ### Pediatric Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【24】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【25】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【26】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【27】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【28】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【29】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【30】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Caffeine citrate (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【31】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【32】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Intravenous\n\n【33】 ### Monitoring\n- Serum concentrations of caffeine may need to be monitored periodically throughout treatment to avoid toxicity.  Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg/L.\n- All preterm infants, patients being treated with caffeine citrate should be carefully monitored for the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n【34】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Caffeine citrate (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # Overdosage\n- Following overdose, serum caffeine levels have ranged from approximately 24 mg/L (a post marketing spontaneous case report in which an infant exhibited irritability, poor feeding and insomnia) to 350 mg/L.  Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg/L.\n been reported in cases of overdose.  One case of caffeine overdose complicated by development of intraventricular hemorrhage and long-term neurological sequelae has been reported.  Another case of caffeine citrate overdose (from New Zealand) of an estimated 600 mg caffeine citrate (approximately 322 mg/kg) administered over 40 minutes was complicated by tachycardia, ST depression, respiratory distress, heart failure, gastric distention, acidosis and a severe extravasation burn with tissue necrosis at the peripheral intravenous injection site.  No deaths associated with caffeine overdose have been reported in preterm infants.\n- Treatment of caffeine overdose is primarily symptomatic and supportive.  Caffeine levels have been shown to decrease after exchange transfusions.  Convulsions may be treated with intravenous administration of diazepam or a barbiturate such as pentobarbital sodium.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n- There is limited information regarding Caffeine citrate (injection) Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Caffeine is structurally related to other methylxanthines, theophylline and theobromine.  It is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant, a CNS stimulant, a cardiac muscle stimulant and a diuretic.\n- Although the mechanism of action of caffeine in apnea of prematurity is not known, several mechanisms have been hypothesized.  These include:  stimulation of the respiratory center,  increased minute ventilation,  decreased threshold to hypercapnia,  increased response to hypercapnia,  increased skeletal muscle tone,  decreased diaphragmatic fatigue,  increased metabolic rate, and  increased oxygen consumption.\n- Most of these effects have been attributed to antagonism of adenosine receptors, both A1 and A2 subtypes, by caffeine, which has been demonstrated in receptor binding assays and observed at concentrations approximating those achieved therapeutically.\n\n【38】 ## Structure\n- Caffeine citrate injection, USP for intravenous administration is a clear, colorless, sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, aqueous solution adjusted to pH 4.7.  Each mL contains 20 mg caffeine citrate (equivalent to 10 mg of caffeine base) prepared in solution by the addition of 10 mg caffeine anhydrous to 5 mg citric acid monohydrate, 8.3 mg sodium citrate dihydrate and Water for Injection.\n- Caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, is an odorless white crystalline powder or granule, with a bitter taste.  It is sparingly soluble in water and ethanol at room temperature.  The chemical name of caffeine is 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione.  In the presence of citric acid it forms caffeine citrate salt in solution.  The structural formula and molecular weight of caffeine citrate follows.\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Caffeine citrate (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- After oral administration of 10 mg caffeine base/kg to preterm neonates, the peak plasma level (Cmax) for caffeine ranged from 6 to 10 mg/L and the mean time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  The Tmax was not affected by formula feeding.  The absolute bioavailability, however, was not fully examined in preterm neonates.\n- Caffeine is rapidly distributed into the brain.  Caffeine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of preterm neonates approximate their plasma levels.  The mean volume of distribution of caffeine in infants (0.8 to 0.9 L/kg) is slightly higher than that in adults (0.6 L/kg).  Plasma protein binding data are not available for neonates or infants.  In adults, the mean plasma protein binding in vitro is reported to be approximately 36%.\n- Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A is involved in caffeine biotransformation.  Caffeine metabolism in preterm neonates is limited due to their immature hepatic enzyme systems.\n- Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates; caffeine levels are approximately 25% of theophylline levels after theophylline administration and approximately 3 to 8% of caffeine administered would be expected to convert to theophylline.\n- In young infants, the elimination of caffeine is much slower than that in adults due to immature hepatic and/or renal function.  Mean half-life (T1/ and fraction excreted unchanged in urine (Ae) of caffeine in infants have been shown to be inversely related to gestational/postconceptual age.  In neonates, the T1/2 is approximately 3 to 4 days and the Ae is approximately 86% (within 6 days).  By 9 months of age, the metabolism of caffeine approximates that seen in adults (T1/2 = 5 hours and Ae = 1%).\n- Studies examining the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in neonates with hepatic or renal insufficiency have not been conducted.  Caffeine citrate should be administered with caution in preterm neonates with impaired renal or hepatic function.  Serum concentrations of caffeine should be monitored and dose administration of caffeine citrate should be adjusted to avoid toxicity in this population.\n- One multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial compared caffeine citrate to placebo in eighty-five  preterm infants (gestational age 28 to <33 weeks) with apnea of prematurity.  Apnea of prematurity was defined as having at least 6 apnea episodes of greater than 20 seconds duration in a 24 hour period with no other identifiable cause of apnea.  A 1 mL/kg (20 mg/kg caffeine citrate providing 10 mg/kg as caffeine base) loading dose of caffeine citrate was administered intravenously, followed by a 0.25 mL/kg (5 mg/kg caffeine citrate providing 2.5 mg/kg of caffeine base) daily maintenance dose administered either intravenously or orally (generally through a feeding tube).  The duration of treatment in this study was limited to 10 to 12 days.  The protocol allowed infants to be “rescued” with open-label caffeine citrate treatment if their apnea remained uncontrolled during the double-blind phase of the trial.\n- The percentage of patients without apnea on day 2 of treatment (24 to 48 hours after the loading dose) was significantly greater with caffeine citrate than placebo.

This risk is higher for women over 35 years old and heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes per day). If you take oral contraceptives, you should not smoke.\n\n【2】 # Why this medication is prescribed\n change the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent pregnancy from developing and change the mucus at the cervix (opening of the uterus) to prevent sperm (male reproductive cells) from entering. Oral contraceptives are a very effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus  and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n used to treat acne in certain patients. Oral contraceptives work to treat acne by decreasing the amounts of certain natural substances that can cause acne.\n\n【3】 # How this medication should be used\n- Oral contraceptives come in packets of 21, 28, or 91 ts to take by mouth once a day, every day or almost every day of a regular cycle. To avoid nausea, take oral contraceptives with food or milk. Take your oral contraceptive at the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take your oral contraceptive exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.\n- Oral contraceptives come in many different brands. Different brands of oral contraceptives contain slightly different medications or doses, are taken in slightly different ways, and have different risks and benefits. Be sure that you know which brand of oral contraceptives you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist \n- If you have a 21-t packet, take one t daily for 21 days and then none for 7 days. Then start a new packet.\n- If you have a 28-t packet, take one t daily for 28 days. The last set of ts in most 28 day packets are a different color. These ts are reminder ts. They do not contain any active ingredients but may contain iron. Taking one of these ts every day will help you remember to start your next packet of birth control pills on time. One type of 28-t packet contains ts that are all the same color. All of the ts in this type of packet contain active ingredients. Whether your packet includes reminder ts or only active ts, you should take one t daily continuously for 28 days in the order specified in your packet. Start a new packet the day after you take your 28th t.\n- If you have a 91-day t packet, take one t daily for 91 days. Your packet will contain three trays of ts. Start with the first t on the first tray and continue taking one t every day in the order specified on the packet until you have taken all of the ts on all of the trays. The last days\n- days ts are a different color. These ts may contain an inactive ingredient, or they may contain a very low dose of estrogen. Start your new packet the day after you take your 91st t.\n tell you whether you need to use another method of birth control during the first 7 days that you take your oral contraceptive and will help you choose a method. Follow these directions carefully.\n- You will probably experience withdrawal bleeding similar to a menstrual period while you are taking the inactive ts or the low dose estrogen ts or during the week that you do not take your oral contraceptive. If you are taking the type of packet that only contains active ts, you will not experience any scheduled bleeding, but you may experience unexpected bleeding and spotting, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to start taking your new packet on schedule even if you are still bleeding.\n- You may need to use a backup method of birth control if you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking an oral contraceptive. Talk to your doctor about this before you begin to take your oral contraceptive so that you can prepare a backup method of birth control in case it is needed. If you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking an oral contraceptive, call your doctor to find out how long you should use the backup method.\n- If you have recently given birth, wait until 4 weeks after delivering to begin taking oral contraceptives. If you have had an abortion or miscarriage, talk to your doctor about when you should begin taking oral contraceptives.\n- Oral contraceptives will work to prevent pregnancy or treat acne only as long as they are taken regularly. Continue to take oral contraceptives every day even if you are spotting or bleeding, have an upset stomach, or do not think that you are likely to become pregnant. Do not stop taking oral contraceptives without talking to your doctor.\n\n【4】 # Other uses for this medicine\n sometimes used to treat heavy or irregular menstruation and endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus  grows in other areas of the body and causes pain, heavy or irregular menstruation , and other symptoms). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n- This medication may be prescribed \n\n【5】 # Special precautions\n- Before taking oral contraceptives:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estrogen, progestin, or any other medications.\n tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec), and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril); angiotensin II antagonists such as irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar), and valsartan (Diovan); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); diuretics ('water pills') such as amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium); or heparin. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n- tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.\n- tell your doctor if you have or have ever had blood clots in your legs, lungs, or eyes; thrombophilia (condition in which the blood clots easily); coronary artery disease (clogged blood vessels leading to the heart); cerebrovascular disease (clogging or weakening of the blood vessels within the brain or leading to the brain); stroke or stroke; an irregular heartbeat; heart disease; a heart attack; chest pain; diabetes that has affected your circulation; headaches that come along with other symptoms such as vision changes, weakness, and dizziness; high blood pressure; breast cancer; cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix, or vagina; liver cancer; liver tumors; yellowing of the skin or eyes during pregnancy or while you were using hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, or injections); or unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding. Also tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery or have been unable to move around for any reason. Your doctor may tell you that you should not take oral contraceptives if you have or have had any of these conditions.\n- Also tell your doctor if anyone in your family has had breast cancer and if you have or have ever had problems with your breasts such as lumps, an abnormal mammogram (breast x-ray), or fibrocystic breast disease (swollen, tender breasts and/or breast lumps that are not cancer); high blood cholesterol or fats; diabetes; asthma; toxemia (high blood pressure during pregnancy); heart attack; chest pain; seizures; migraine headaches; depression; gallbladder or kidney disease; adrenal insufficiency (for Yasmin); jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes); and excessive weight gain and fluid retention (bloating) during the menstrual cycle.\n- do not take oral contraceptives if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor immediately.\n- if you miss periods while you are taking oral contraceptives, you may be pregnant. If you are using a 91-t packet and you miss one period, call your doctor. If you are using another type of packet according to the directions and you miss one period, you may continue to take your ts. However, if you have not taken your ts as directed and you miss one period or if you have taken your ts as directed and you miss two periods, call your doctor and use another method of birth control until you have a pregnancy test. If you are using a 28-t packet that contains only active ts, you will not expect to have periods on a regular basis, so it may be hard to tell if you are pregnant. If you are using this type of oral contraceptive, call your doctor and have a pregnancy test if you experience symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea, vomiting, and breast tenderness, or if you suspect you may be pregnant.\n- if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking oral contraceptives.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you wear contact lenses. If you notice changes in vision or ability to wear your lenses while taking oral contraceptives, see an eye doctor.\n\n【6】 # Special dietary instructions\n- Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n【7】 # What to do if you forget a dose\n- If you miss doses of your oral contraceptive, you may not be protected from pregnancy. You may need to use a backup method of birth control \n\n【8】 # Side effects\n\n【9】 ## Minor side effects\n- Oral contraceptives may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- stomach cramps or bloating\n- diarrhea\n- constipation\n- gingivitis (swelling of the gum tissue)\n- increased or decreased appetite\n- weight gain or weight loss\n- brown or black skin patches\n- acne\n- hair growth in unusual places\n- bleeding or spotting between menstrual periods\n- changes in menstrual flow\n- painful or missed periods\n- breast tenderness, enlargement, or discharge\n- difficulty wearing contact lenses\n- swelling, redness, irritation, burning, or itching of the vagina\n- white vaginal discharge\n\n【10】 ## Severe side effects\n- Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n- severe headache\n- severe vomiting\n- speech problems\n- dizziness or faintness\n- weakness or numbness of an arm or leg\n- crushing chest pain or chest heaviness\n- coughing up blood\n- shortness of breath\n- pain, warmth, or heaviness in the back of the lower leg\n- partial or complete loss of vision\n- double vision\n- bulging eyes\n- severe stomach pain\n- yellowing of the skin or eyes\n- loss of appetite\n- extreme tiredness, weakness, or lack of energy\n- fever\n- dark-colored urine\n- light-colored stool\n- swelling of the hands, feet, ankles or lower legs\n have trouble sleeping, tiredness, loss of energy, or other *mood changes\n- unusual bleeding\n- rash\n- menstrual bleeding that is unusually heavy or that lasts for longer than 7 days in a row\n increase the chance that you will develop breast or liver cancer, or have a heart attack, a stroke, or a serious blood clot. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using oral contraceptives.\n- Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects.

This is done due to the increased pressure build-up and back-up into the portal system which is a system of blood vessels that supply various parts of your gut. The procedure is done by an interventional doctor using ultrasound.\n\n【2】 # Why the Procedure is Performed?\n- Normally, blood coming from your esophagus, stomach, and intestines first flows through the liver. When your liver has a lot of damage and there are blockages, blood cannot flow through it very easily. This is called portal hypertension (increased pressure and backup of the portal vein). The veins can then break open (rupture), causing serious bleeding.\n- Common causes of portal hypertension are:\n- Alcohol use causing scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n- Blood clots in a vein that flows from the liver to the heart\n- Too much iron in the liver (hemochromatosis)\n- Hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n- When portal hypertension occurs, you may have:\n- Bleeding from veins of the stomach, esophagus, or intestines (variceal bleeding)\n- Buildup of fluid in the belly (ascites)\n- Buildup of fluid in the chest (hydrothorax)\n- This procedure allows blood to flow better in your liver, stomach, esophagus, and intestines, and then back to your heart.\n\n【3】 # Prior to Procedure\n- The night before to your procedure, do not eat any food or drink any liquid. However, you may be allowed to drink clear liquids to help you on the day of the TIPS procedure. It is well advised to take your morning medication as instructed by your physician and to stay in the hospital for 24 hrs for observation after the procedure.\n- Your doctor may ask you to have these tests:\n- Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney tests)\n- Chest x-ray or ECG\n- Tell your health care provider:\n- If you are or could be pregnant\n- Any medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription (your doctor may ask you to stop taking blood thinners like aspirin, heparin, warfarin, or other blood thinners a few days before the procedure)\n- DO NOT eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the procedure.\n- Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of the procedure. Take these drugs with a small sip of water.\n- Take a shower the night before or the morning of the procedure.\n- Arrive on time at the hospital.\n- You should plan to stay overnight at the hospital.\n\n【4】 # During the Procedure\n- The doctor inserts a catheter (a flexible tube) through your skin into a vein in your neck. This vein is called the jugular vein. On the end of the catheter is a tiny balloon and a metal mesh stent (tube).\n- Using an x-ray machine, the doctor guides the catheter into a vein in your liver.\n- Dye (contrast material) is then injected into the vein so that it can be seen more clearly.\n- The balloon is inflated to place the stent. You may feel a little pain when this happens.\n- The doctor uses the stent to connect your portal vein to one of your hepatic veins.\n- At the end of the procedure, your portal vein pressure is measured to make sure it has gone down.\n- The catheter with the balloon is then removed.\n- After the procedure, a small bandage is placed over the neck area. There are usually no stitches.\n- The procedure takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete.\n\n【5】 # After the Procedure\n- After the procedure, you will recover in your hospital room. You will be monitored for bleeding. You will have to keep your head raised.\n- There is usually no pain after the procedure.\n- You will be able to go home when you feel better. This may be the day after the procedure.\n- Many people get back to their everyday activities in 7 to 10 days.\n- Your doctor will probably do an ultrasound after the procedure to make sure the stent is working correctly.\n- You will be asked to have a repeat ultrasound in a few weeks to make sure that the TIPS procedure is working.\n\n【6】 # Risks\n\n【7】 # Outlook (Prognosis)\n- Your radiologist can tell you right away how well the procedure worked. Most people recover well.\n- TIPS works in about 80% to 90% of portal hypertension cases.\n- The procedure is much safer than surgery and does not involve any cutting or stitches.\n\n【8】 # Goal\n- This new pathway will allow blood to flow better. It will ease pressure on the veins of your stomach, esophagus, intestines, and liver.\n\n【9】 # Alternative Names\n- TIPS; Cirrhosis - TIPS; Liver failure - TIPS", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:12:53"}

Porteranthus) is a genus of two species of perennial herbs in the Rosaceae family. Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, indian-physic, American ipecac. This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America. Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger lower leaves are divided into palmately arranged leaflets. Plants bloom in May, June, or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp as if they were wilted. The flowers mature into small capsules. These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used medicinally as an herbal remedy.\n\n【1】 # Classification and name\n- Traditionally this genus is considered a member of subfamily Spiraeoideae. However, this genus is sometimes included in the subfamily Maloideae (or Pomoideae). This is somewhat controversial since members of this subfamily typically include only woody pome bearing plants with a haploid chromosome number of 17, and Gillenia is herbaceous and has a haploid chromosome number of 9.\n- It is not totally clear whether Gillenia (Moench) or Porteranthus (Britton ex Small) is the best name to use for this genus. Most current North American scholarly sources use the latter synonym Porteranthus citing that Gillenia is already occupied by way of quasi-synonymy: Gillena was used by Michel Adanson as a synonym for Clethra (The ICBN rules that \"similar names that can be confused\" should be treated as synonyms). A proposal to formally conserve Gillenia was mooted after a vote determined that Gillena was not validly published and that it and Gillenia were not likely to be confused. Several sources continue to use Porteranthus: Missouri Botanical Gardens 2007, Moerman 2003, Gleason & Cronquist 1991, and Magee and Ahles 1999. The Flora of North America volume containing this genus is not yet published.\n\n【2】 # Species\n tends to have longer leaves and petals.\n- G. trifoliata or Porteranthus trifoliatus -- mountain indian physic\n- G. stipulata or Porteranthus stipulatus -- indian physic", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:20:31"}

In morphological studies, this requires explicit decisions about which physical characteristics to measure and how to use them to encode distinct states corresponding to the input taxa. In molecular studies, a primary problem is in producing a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) between the genes or amino acid sequences of interest. Progressive sequence alignment methods produce a phylogenetic tree by necessity because they incorporate new sequences into the calculated alignment in order of genetic distance. Although a phylogenetic tree can always be constructed from an MSA, phylogenetics methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood do not require the production of an initial or concurrent MSA.\n\n【1】 # Types of phylogenetic trees\n- Phylogenetic trees generated by computational phylogenetics can be either rooted or unrooted depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a directed graph that explicitly identifies a most recent common ancestor (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as leaf nodes and their distances from the root proportional to their genetic distance from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one \"outgroup\" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.\n- By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the molecular clock hypothesis.\n- The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional \"tree space\" through which search paths can be traced by optimization algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.\n\n【2】 # Coding characters and defining homology\n\n【3】 ## Morphological analysis\n- The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a matrix representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant. Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of convergent evolution of phenotypes. A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete fossil records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of apes produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.\n- Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, \n- Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.\n\n【4】 ## Molecular analysis\n- The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct nucleotides in DNA or RNA sequences and distinct amino acids in protein sequences. However, defining homology can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of multiple sequence alignment. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are \"mutations\" versus ancestral characters, and which events are insertion mutations or deletion mutations. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.\n\n【5】 # Distance-matrix methods\n- Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of \"genetic distance\" between the sequences being classified, and there\n\n【6】 ## Neighbor-joining\n- Neighbor-joining methods apply general data clustering techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple neighbor-joining method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a molecular clock) across lineages. Its relative, UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) produces rooted trees and requires a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an ultrametric tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.\n\n【7】 ## Fitch-Margoliash method\n- The Fitch-Margoliash method uses a weighted least squares method for clustering based on genetic distance. Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be linear; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the expected values of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of back mutations at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a substitution matrix such as that derived from the Jukes-Cantor model of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.\n be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is NP-complete, so heuristic search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.\n\n【8】 ## Using outgroups\n confound outgroup usage.\n\n【9】 # Maximum parsimony\n include a \"cost\" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular nucleotides or amino acids are known to be more muthan others.\n- The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be NP-hard; consequently a number of heuristic search methods for optimization have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the most optimal in the set. Most such methods involve a steepest descent-style minimization mechanism operating on a tree rearrangement criterion.\n\n【10】 ## Branch and bound\n- The branch and bound algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of NP-hard problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s. Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a tree structure as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate \"most parsimonious\" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.\n\n【11】 # Sankoff-Morel-Cedergrenalgorithm\n- The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences. The method uses a maximum parsimony calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events. The imputed sequences at the interior nodes of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.\n\n【12】 # MALIGNand POY\n- More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a cladogram score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA. However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events. Both programs are available from the American Museum of Natural History.\n\n【13】 # Maximum likelihood\n- The maximum likelihood method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring probability distributions to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a substitution model to assess the probability of particular mutations; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be statistically independent. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but because it formally requires search of all possible combinations of tree topology and branch length, it is computationally expensive to perform on more than a few sequences.\n includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general global optimization tools such as the Newton-Raphson method are often used. Searching tree topologies defined by likelihood has not been shown to be NP-complete, but remains extremely challenging because branch-and-bound search is not yet effective for trees represented in this way.\n\n【14】 # Bayesian inference\n- Bayesian inference can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior probability distribution of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as speciation occur as stochastic processes. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.\n- Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting  leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step and swapping descendant subtrees of a random internal node between two related trees. The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.\n\n【15】 # Model selection\n- Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined substitution model that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of mutation at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of transitions and transversions in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the genetic distance between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before coalescence). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of long branch attraction, or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related. The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.\n\n【16】 ## Types of models\n- All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G>C nucleotide mutation as to a C>G mutation. The simplest possible model, the Jukes-Cantor model, assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate. More advanced models distinguish between transitions and transversions. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has contains six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages. One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.\n allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base codons. If the location of the open reading frame (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that wobble base pairing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the genetic code. A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the gamma distribution or log-normal distribution. Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the covarion method allows autocorrelated variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.\n\n【17】 ## Choosing the best model\n- The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit. The most common method of model selection is the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of \"goodness of fit\" between the model and the input data. However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.

It is a member of the Pseudomonas genus, and based on 16S rRNA analysis, P. syringae has been placed in the P. syringae group. It is a plant pathogen which can infect a wide range of plant species, and exists as over 50 different pathovars. Many of these pathovars were once considered to be individual species within the Pseudomonas genus, but molecular biology techniques such as DNA hybridization have shown these to in fact all be part of the P. syringae species. It is named after the lilac tree (Syringa vulgaris), from which it was first isolated.\n demonstrates ice nucleating properties.\n\n【1】 # Epidemiology\n- Disease by P. syringae tends to be favoured by wet, cool conditions - optimum temperatures for disease tend to be around 12–25°C, although this can vary according to the pathovar involved. The bacteria tend to be seed borne, and are dispersed between plants via rain splash\n live as a saprophyte in the phyllosphere when conditions are not favourable for disease. Some saprophytic strains of P. syringae have been used as biocontrol agents against post-harvest rots.\n\n【2】 # Pathovars\n- Following ribotypical analysis several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae were incorporated into other species . The remaining pathovars are as follows:\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. aceris attacks maple Acer species.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata attacks beets Beta vulgaris.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens attacks wheat Triticum aestivum.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. dysoxylis attacks the kohekohe tree Dysoxylum spectabile.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. japonica attacks barley Hordeum vulgare.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. lapsa attacks wheat Triticum aestivum.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. panici attacks Panicum grass species.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans attacks crabapple Malus sylvestris species.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi attacks peas Pisum sativum.\n- Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae attacks Syringa and Phaseolus species.\n- Note that Pseudomonas savastanoi was once considered a pathovar or sub-species of P. syringae, and in many places continues to be referred to as Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi, although as a result of DNA-relatedness studies it has been instated as a new species.

It is traditionally referred to as the grammatical inference problem.\n- Machine learning algorithms take a training set, form hypotheses or models, and make predictions about the future. Because the training set is finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield absolute guarantees of performance of the algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance of machine learning algorithms are quite common.\n- In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results:\n- Positive results --- Showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.\n- Negative results - Showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n- Negative results are proven only by assumption.

Additionally, there is no apparent benefit to therapy during pregnancy, and safety in pregnant women has not been established.  If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.\n- Nursing mothers.\n- Because another drug in this class passes into breast milk, and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but increase in a dose-dependent manner. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism.  In a clinical study (EXCEL) in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20-40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.\n- There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents.\n- All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose of lovastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing lovastatin.   Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\n be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; dehydration; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.\n- Drug Interactions that can cause skeletal muscle effects\n- Strong CYP3A Inhibitors\n- The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma.  Lovastatin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4.  Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of lovastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy.  Co-administration of these drugs with lovastatin is contraindicated.  If treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment.\n- Erythromycin\n- Co-administration of erythromycin with lovastatin is contraindicated.  If treatment with erythromycin is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment.\n- Gemfibrozil\n- Avoid the combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil.\n- Other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates, or lipid-lowering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin\n- Use caution when prescribing other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone and the risk is increased when they are coadministered with lovastatin.  Carefully weigh the expected benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates or niacin against the potential risks of these combinations.\n- Cyclosporine\n- Avoid the combined use of lovastatin with cyclosporine.\n- Danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin\n- Do not exceed 20 mg of lovastatin daily in patients receiving concomitant therapy with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil.  Weigh carefully the benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil against the risks of these combinations.\n- Amiodarone\n- Do not exceed 40 mg of lovastatin daily in patients receiving concomitant therapy with amiodarone.  Avoid the combined use of lovastatin at doses exceeding 40 mg daily with amiodarone unless the clinical benefit is likely to outweigh the increased risk of myopathy.  The concomitant use of higher doses of a closely related member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class with amiodarone increased the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\n- Colchicine\n- There have been cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, reported in patients  receiving lovastatin coadministered with colchicine. Use caution when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine.\n- Ranolazine\n- Concomitant use of ranolazine and lovastatin may increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Consider dose adjustment of lovastatin if coadministering with ranolazine.\n- Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in the below.\n\n【16】 # Liver Enzyme Abnormalities\n- Increases in serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase  or alanine aminotransferase ) have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin.\n- Persistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials.  When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels.\n- It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with lovastatin and repeated as clinically indicated.  There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin.  If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with lovastatin, promptly interrupt therapy.  If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart lovastatin.\n- The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of chronic liver disease.  Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.\n- In controlled clinical trials (467 patients treated with lovastatin and 329 patients treated with lovastatin immediate-release) no meaningful differences in transaminase elevations between the two treatments were observed.\n- Lovastatin\n- In the EXCEL study , the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin.  However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin immediate-release, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages.\n- In AFCAPS/TexCAPS, the number of participants with consecutive elevations of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (>3 times the upper limit of normal), over a median of 5.1 years of follow-up, was not significantly different between the lovastatin immediate-release and placebo groups .  Elevated transaminases resulted in discontinuation of 6 (0.2%) participants from therapy in the lovastatin immediate-release group (n=3, and 4 (0.1%) in the placebo group (n=3,.\n\n【17】 ### Endocrine Effects\n- Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin.\n receiving other drugs (e.g., spironolactone, cimetidine) that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- In controlled clinical trials with lovastatin, (467 patients with mean exposure to study drug of approximately 11.6 weeks),  3.2% of patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions.  This was similar to the discontinuation rate in the placebo (2/34, 5.9%) and lovastatin immediate-release (3.3%) treatment groups.\n- Pooled results from clinical trials with v show that the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the lovastatin group were infection, headache and accidental injury.  Similar incidences of these adverse reactions were seen in the lovastatin and placebo groups.  In controlled clinical trials, clinical adverse reactions reported in >5% of patients in any treatment group are shown in the below.\n- In AFCAPS/TexCAPS\n- involving 6,605 participants treated with 20-40 mg/day of lovastatin immediate-release (n=3, or placebo (n=3,, the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with lovastatin immediate-release was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 5.1 years of follow-up.\n- AFCAPS/TexCAPS\n- The number of participants with consecutive elevations of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (>3 times the upper limit of normal), over a median of 5.1 years of follow-up, was not significantly different between the lovastatin immediate-release and placebo groups .  The starting dose of lovastatin immediate-release was 20 mg/day; 50% of the lovastatin immediate-release treated participants were titrated to 40 mg/day at Week 18.  Of the 18 participants on lovastatin immediate-release with consecutive elevations of either ALT or AST, 11 (0.7%) elevations occurred in participants taking 20 mg/day, while 7 (0.4%) elevations occurred in participants titrated to 40 mg/day.  Elevated transaminases resulted in discontinuation of 6 (0.2%) participants from therapy in the lovastatin immediate-release group (n=3, and 4 (0.1%) in the placebo group (n=3,.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lovastatin and/or are class effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Skeletal: muscle cramps, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias.\n- There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use.\n- Neurological: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, dizziness, vertigo, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy, psychic disturbances, anxiety, insomnia, depression.\n- There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use.  These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n- Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver; and rarely, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and hepatoma; anorexia, vomiting, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure.\n- Skin: alopecia, pruritus.  A variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails) have been reported.\n- Reproductive: gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction.\n- Eye: progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia.\n- Laboratory Abnormalities: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities.\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\n- Drug interaction studies have not been performed with lovastatin. The types, frequencies and magnitude of drug interactions that may be encountered whenlovastatin is administered with other drugs may differ from the drug interactions encountered with the lovastatin immediate-release formulation. In addition, as the drug exposure with lovastatin 60 mg is greater than that with lovastatin immediate-release 80 mg (maximum recommended dose), the severity and magnitude of drug interactions that may be encountered with lovastatin 60 mg are not known. It is therefore recommended that the following precautions and recommendations for the concomitant administration of lovastatin immediate-release with other drugs be interpreted with caution, and that the monitoring of the pharmacologic effects of lovastatin and/or other concomitantly administered drugs be undertaken where appropriate.\n- Strong CYP3A Inhibitors\n- Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A.  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, and nefazodone), increase the risk of myopathy by reducing the elimination of lovastatin.  The use of lovastatin with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated.\n- Erythromycin\n- Do not use lovastatin concomitantly with erythromycin.\n- Interactions with lipid-lowering drugs that can cause myopathy when given alone\n increased by the following lipid-lowering drugs that are not strong CYP3A inhibitors, but which can cause myopathy when given alone.\n- Gemfibrozil – Avoid the concomitant use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil.\n- Other fibrates - Use caution when prescribing lovastatin with other fibrates.\n- Niacin (nicotinic acid) (≥1 g/day)\n- Use caution when prescribing lovastatin with lipid-modifying (≥1 g/day) doses of niacin.\n- Cyclosporine\n- Avoid the concomitant use of lovastatin with cyclosporine.\n- Danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil\n- Do not exceed 20 mg of lovastatin daily in patients receiving concomitant therapy with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil.\n- Amiodarone\n- Do not exceed 40 mg of lovastatin daily in patients receiving concomitant therapy with amiodarone.\n- Coumarin Anticoagulants\n- In a small clinical trial in which lovastatin was administered to warfarin treated patients, no effect on prothrombin time was detected.  However, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been found to produce a less than two second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of warfarin.  Also, bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time has been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly with lovastatin.  In patients taking anticoagulants, prothrombin time should be determined before starting lovastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs.  Once a sprothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants.  If the dose of lovastatin is changed, the same procedure should be repeated.  Lovastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.\n- Colchicine\n- Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine.  Exercise caution when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine.\n- Ranolazine\n- The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of ranolazine.  Exercise caution when prescribing lovastatin with ranolazine.  Dose adjustment of lovastatin may be necessary during coadministration with ranolazine.\n\n【22】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA): X\n- Safety in pregnant women has not been established. Lovastatin immediate-release has been shown to produce skeletal malformations at plasma levels 40 times the human exposure (for mouse fetus) and 80 times the human exposure (for rat fetus) based on mg/m2 surface area (doses were 800 mg/kg/day). No drug-induced changes were seen in either species at multiples of 8 times (rat) or 4 times (mouse) based on surface area. No evidence of malformations was noted in rabbits at exposures up to 3 times the human exposure (dose of 15 mg/kg/day, highest tolerated dose of lovastatin immediate-release).\n- Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.  In a review2 of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to lovastatin immediate-release or another structurally related HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population.  The number of cases is adequate only to exclude a 3 to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence. In 89% of the prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified.  As safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with lovastatin during pregnancy, treatment should be immediately discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized.  Lovastatin should be administered to women of child-bearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazard.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Lovastatin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Lovastatin during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether lovastatin is excreted in human milk.  Because a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human breast milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking lovastatin should not nurse their infants.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  Because pediatric patients are not likely to benefit from cholesterol lowering for at least a decade and because experience with this drug is limited (no studies in subjects below the age of 20 years), treatment of pediatric patients with lovastatin is not recommended at this time.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the 467 patients who received lovastatin in controlled clinical studies, 18% were 65 years and older.  Of the 297 patients who received lovastatin in uncontrolled clinical studies, 22% were 65 years and older.  No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  Thus, lower starting doses of lovastatin are recommended for elderly patients.\n- In pharmacokinetic studies with lovastatin immediate-release, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was shown to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70-78 years of age compared with patients between 18-30 years of age; however, clinical study experience in the elderly indicates that dosage adjustment based on this age-related pharmacokinetic difference is not needed.  In the two large clinical studies conducted with lovastatin immediate-release (EXCEL and AFCAPS/TexCAPS), 21% (3094/ of patients were ≥65 years of age.  Lipid-lowering efficacy with lovastatin was at least as great in elderly patients compared with younger patients, and there were no overall differences in safety over the 20 to 80 mg dosage range.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Lovastatin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Lovastatin with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\n- In a study of patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 mL/min), the plasma concentrations of total inhibitors after a single dose of lovastatin were approximately two-fold higher than those in healthy volunteers.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Lovastatin in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Lovastatin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Lovastatin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Lovastatin Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Lovastatin and IV administrations.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- After oral administration of lovastatin immediate-release to mice the median lethal dose observed was >15 g/m2.\n- Five healthy human volunteers have received up to 200 mg of lovastatin as a single dose without clinically significant adverse experiences.  A few cases of accidental overdosage with lovastatin immediate-release have been reported; no patients had any specific symptoms, and all patients recovered without sequelae. The maximum dose taken was 5 g to 6 g.\n- Until further experience is obtained, no specific treatment of overdosage with lovastatin can be recommended.\n- The dialyzability of lovastatin and its metabolites in man is not known at present.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Lovastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid, a strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Lovastatin ts contain a cholesterol-lowering agent isolated from a strain of Aspergillus terreus. After oral ingestion, lovastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid form.  This is a principal metabolite and inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.  This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol.\n- Lovastatin is ]-1,2,3,7,8,8a-hexahydro-3,7-dimethyl-8--1-naphthalenyl 2-methylbutanoate.  The empirical formula of lovastatin is C24H36O5 and its molecular weight is 404.55.  Its structural formula is:\n- Lovastatin is a white, nonhygroscopic crystalline powder that is insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile.\n- ts are designed for once-a-day oral administration and deliver 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg of lovastatin.  In addition to the active ingredient lovastatin, each t contains the following inactive ingredients: acetyltributyl citrate; butylated hydroxy anisole; candellila wax; cellulose acetate; confectioner’s sugar (contains corn starch); F D & C yellow # 6; glyceryl monostearate; hypromellose; hypromellose phthalate; lactose; methacrylic acid copolymer, type B; polyethylene glycols (PEG 400, PEG ; polyethylene oxides; polysorbate 80; propylene glycol; silicon dioxide; sodium chloride; sodium lauryl sulfate; synthetic black iron oxide; red iron oxide; talc; titanium dioxide and triacetin.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Lovastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans.  The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance.\n- The involvement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in atherogenesis has been well documented in clinical and pathological studies, as well as in many animal experiments.  Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that high LDL-C and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are both associated with coronary heart disease.  However, the risk of developing coronary heart disease is continuous and graded over the range of cholesterol levels and many coronary events do occur in patients with total cholesterol (Total-C) and LDL-C levels in the lower end of this range.\n- Lovastatin immediate-release ts have been shown to reduce elevated LDL-C concentrations.  LDL is formed from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and is catabolized predominantly by the high-affinity LDL receptor.  The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of lovastatin immediate-release may involve both reduction of VLDL-C concentration, and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL-C.  The independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.  The effects of lovastatin immediate-release on lipoprotein (a) , fibrinogen, and certain other independent biochemical risk markers for coronary heart disease are unknown.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption:\n- The appearance of lovastatin in plasma from an lovastatin extended-release t is slower and more prolonged compared to the lovastatin immediate-release formulation.\n- A pharmacokinetic study carried out with lovastatin involved measurement of the systemic concentrations of lovastatin (pro-drug), lovastatin acid (active-drug) and total and active inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase.  The pharmacokinetic parameters in 12 hypercholesterolemic subjects at steady state, after 28 days of treatment, comparing lovastatin 40 mg to lovastatin immediate-release 40 mg, are summarized in the below.\n- The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of lovastatin and lovastatin acid in patients after multiple doses of lovastatin immediate-release at day 28 are shown in the graph below.\n- The extended-release properties of lovastatin are characterized by a prolonged absorptive phase, which results in a longer Tmax and lower Cmax for lovastatin (pro-drug) and its major metabolite, lovastatin acid, compared to lovastatin immediate-release.\n- The bioavailability of lovastatin (pro-drug) as measured by the AUC0-24hr was greater for lovastatin compared to lovastatin immediate-release (as measured by a chemical assay), while the bioavailability of total and active inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase were equivalent to lovastatin immediate-release (as measured by an enzymatic assay).\n- With once-a-day dosing, mean values of AUCs of active and total inhibitors at steady state were about 1.8-1.9 times those following a single dose.  Accumulation ratio of lovastatin exposure was 1.5 after multiple daily doses of lovastatin compared to that of a single dose measured using a chemical assay.  lovastatin appears to have dose linearity for doses from 10 mg up to 60 mg per day.\n- When lovastatin was given after a meal, plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid were about 0.5 - 0.6 times those found when lovastatin was administered in the fasting state, indicating that food decreases the bioavailability of lovastatin.  There was an association between the bioavailability of lovastatin and dosing after mealtimes.  Bioavailability was lowered under the following conditions, (from higher bioavailability to lower bioavailability) in the following order: under overnight fasting conditions, before bedtime, with dinner, and with a high fat breakfast.  In a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study, patients were administered 40 mg of lovastatin at three different times; before breakfast, after dinner and at bedtime.  Although there was no statistical difference in the extent of lipid change between the three groups, there was a numerically greater reduction in LDL-C and TG and an increase in HDL-C when lovastatin was administered at bedtime.  Results of this study are displayed in the below.\n- Lovastatin Immediate-Release\n\n【44】 - Distribution:\n- Both lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (>95%) to human plasma proteins.  Animal studies demonstrated that lovastatin crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers.\n- In animal studies, after oral dosing, lovastatin had high selectivity for the liver, where it achieved substantially higher concentrations than in non-target tissues.\n- Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of drug equivalents in the bile.  As a consequence of extensive hepatic extraction of lovastatin, the availability of drug to the general circulation is low and variable.\n- Metabolism: Metabolism studies with lovastatin have not been conducted.\n- Lovastatin\n- Lovastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid, a strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase.  Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is the basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the β-hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of lovastatin.\n- The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the β-hydroxyacid of lovastatin, its 6’-hydroxy derivative, and two additional metabolites.  The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy.\n- Lovastatin is a substrate for CYP3A4.  Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that inhibit CYP3A and can increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In one study1, 10 subjects consumed 200 mL of double-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with one rather than 3 cans of water) three times daily for 2 days and an additional 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice together with and 30 and 90 minutes following a single dose of 80 mg lovastatin on the third day.  This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in mean increases in the concentration of lovastatin and its beta-hydroxyacid metabolite (as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve) of 15-fold and 5-fold respectively (as measured using a chemical assay – liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry).  In a second study, 15 subjects consumed one 8 oz glass of single-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with 3 cans of water) with breakfast for 3 consecutive days and a single dose of 40 mg lovastatin in the evening of the third day.  This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in a mean increase in the plasma concentration (as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity  of 1.34-fold and 1.36-fold, respectively, and of lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite (measured using a chemical assay – liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry) of 1.94-fold and 1.57-fold, respectively.  The effect of amounts of grapefruit juice between those used in these two studies on lovastatin pharmacokinetics has not been studied.\n- Digoxin: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, concomitant administration of lovastatin and digoxin resulted in no effect on digoxin plasma concentrations.\n- Oral H=hypoglycemic agents: In pharmacokinetic studies of lovastatin immediate-release in hypercholesterolemic non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, there was no drug interaction with glipizide or with chlorpropamide.\n- Excretion: In a single-dose study with lovastatin, the amounts of lovastatin and lovastatin acid excreted in the urine were below the lower limit of quantitation of the assay (1.0 ng/mL), indicating that negligible excretion of lovastatin occurs through the kidney.\n- Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of drug equivalents in the bile.\n\n【45】 ### Specific Populations\n- Geriatric: Lovastatin Immediate-Release\n- In a study with lovastatin immediate-release which included 16 elderly patients between 70-78 years of age who received lovastatin immediate-release 80 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18-30 years of age.\n- Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\n- Gender: In a single dose pharmacokinetic study with lovastatin, there were no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between men (n= and women (n=, although exposure tended to be higher in men than women.\n- In clinical studies with lovastatin, there was no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction between men and women.\n- Renal Impairment: In a study of patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min), the plasma concentrations of total inhibitors after a single dose of lovastatin were approximately two-fold higher than those in healthy volunteers.\n- Hemodialysis: The effect of hemodialysis on plasma levels of lovastatin and its metabolites have not been studied.\n- Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic studies with lovastatin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n\n【47】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- In a 21-month carcinogenic study in mice with lovastatin immediate-release, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in both males and females at 500 mg/kg/day.  This dose produced a total plasma drug exposure 3 to 4 times that of humans given the highest recommended dose of lovastatin (drug exposure was measured as total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in extracted plasma).  Tumor increases were not seen at 20 and 100 mg/kg/day, doses that produced drug exposures of 0.3 to 2 times that of humans at the 80 mg/day lovastatin immediate-release dose.  A statistically significant increase in pulmonary adenomas was seen in female mice at approximately 4 times the human drug exposure.  .\n- There was an increase in incidence of papilloma in the non-glandular mucosa of the stomach of mice beginning at exposures of 1 to 2 times that of humans given lovastatin immediate-release.  The glandular mucosa was not affected.  The human stomach contains only glandular mucosa.\n- In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, there was a positive dose response relationship for hepatocellular carcinogenicity in males at drug exposures between 2-7 times that of human exposure at 80 mg/day lovastatin immediate-release (doses in rats were 5, 30 and 180 mg/kg/day).\n- An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms in rats appears to be a response that has been seen with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\n significantly increased the incidence of lung adenomas in mid- and high-dose males and females.  Adenomas of the Harderian gland (a gland of the eye of rodents) were significantly higher in high dose mice than in controls.\n- No evidence of mutagenicity was observed with lovastatin immediate-release in a microbial mutagen test using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium with or without rat or mouse liver metabolic activation.  In addition, no evidence of damage to genetic material was noted in an in vitro alkaline elution assay using rat or mouse hepatocytes, a V-79 mammalian cell forward mutation study, an in vitro chromosome aberration study in CHO cells, or an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow.\n- Drug-related testicular atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis, spermatocytic degeneration and giant cell formation were seen in dogs starting at 20 mg/kg/day with lovastatin immediate-release.  Similar findings were seen with another drug in this class.  No drug-related effects on fertility were found in studies with lovastatin in rats.  However, in studies with a similar drug in this class, there was decreased fertility in male rats treated for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body weight, although this effect was not observed in a subsequent fertility study when this same dose was administered for 11 weeks (the entire cycle of spermatogenesis, including epididymal maturation).  In rats treated with this same reductase inhibitor at 180 mg/kg/day, seminiferous tubule degeneration (necrosis and loss of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed.  No microscopic changes were observed in the testes from rats of either study.  The clinical significance of these findings is unclear.\n\n【48】 # Clinical Studies\n- Lovastatin has been shown to reduce Total-C, LDL-C, and TG and increase HDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia.  Near maximal response was observed after four weeks of treatment and the response was maintained with continuation of therapy for up to 6 months.\n- In a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response study in adult men and women 21 to 70 years of age with primary hypercholesterolemia, once daily administration of lovastatin 10 to 60 mg in the evening was compared to placebo.  Lovastatin produced dose related reductions in LDL-C and Total-C.  Lovastatin  produced mean reductions in TG across all doses that varied from approximately 10% to 25%.  Lovastatin  produced mean increases in HDL-C across all doses that varied from approximately 9% to 13%.\n- The lipid changes with lovastatin  treatment in this study, from baseline to endpoint, are displayed in the below.\n- The range of LDL-C responses is represented graphically in the following in the below:\n- The distribution of LDL-C responses is represented graphically by the boxplots in the above.  The bottom line of the box represents the 25th percentile and the top line, the 75th percentile.  The horizontal line in the box represents the median and the gray area is the 95% confidence interval for the median.  The range of responses is depicted by the tails and outliers.\n- Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study\n- Lovastatin immediate-release was compared to placebo in 8,245 patients with hypercholesterolemia ] 240-300mg/dL (6.2 mmol/L-7.6 mmol/L), LDL-C >160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L)] in the randomized, double-blind, parallel, 48-week EXCEL study.  All changes in the lipid measurements observed in lovastatin immediate-release-treated patients were dose-related and significantly different from placebo (p≤0  These results were sustained throughout the study.\n- Lovastatin Long-Term Study\n- A total of 365 patients were enrolled in an extension study in which all patients were administered lovastatin 40 mg or 60 mg once daily for up to 6 months of treatment.  The lipid-altering effects of lovastatin were comparable to what was observed in the dose-response study, and were maintained for up to 6 months of treatment.\n- Specific Populations\n no statistically significant differences in LDL-C reduction between male and female patients.\n- Lovastatin Immediate-Release\n- Lovastatin immediate-release has been shown to be effective in reducing Total-C and LDL-C in heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of primary hypercholesterolemia and in mixed hyperlipidemia.  A marked response was seen within 2 weeks, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks.  The response was maintained during continuation of therapy.  Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night.\n- Lovastatin immediate-release was studied in controlled trials in hypercholesterolemic patients with well-controlled non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with normal renal function.  The effect of lovastatin immediate-release on lipids and lipoproteins and the safety profile of lovastatin immediate-release were similar to that demonstrated in studies in nondiabetics.  Lovastatin immediate-release had no clinically important effect on glycemic control or on the dose requirement of oral hypoglycemic agents.\n- The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, primary prevention study, demonstrated that treatment with lovastatin immediate-release decreased the rate of acute major coronary events (composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, unsangina, and sudden cardiac death) compared with placebo during a median of 5.1 years of follow-up.  Participants were middle-aged and elderly men (ages 45- and women (ages 55- without symptomatic cardiovascular disease with average to moderately elevated Total-C and LDL-C, below average HDL-C, and who were at high risk based on elevated Total-C/HDL-C.  In addition to age, 63% of the participants had at least one other risk factor (baseline HDL-C <35 mg/dL, hypertension, family history, smoking and diabetes).\n- AFCAPS/TexCAPS enrolled 6,605 participants .  Approximately 50% of the participants treated with lovastatin immediate-release were titrated to 40 mg daily when their LDL-C remained >110 mg/dL at the 20-mg starting dose.\n- Lovastatin immediate-release reduced the risk of a first acute major coronary event, the primary efficacy endpoint, by 37% (lovastatin immediate-release 3.5%, placebo 5.5%; p<0.001; .  A first acute major coronary event was defined as myocardial infarction (54 participants on lovastatin immediate-release, 94 on placebo) or unsangina (54 vs.  or sudden cardiac death (8 vs. .  Furthermore, among the secondary endpoints, lovastatin immediate-release reduced the risk of unsangina by 32% (1.8% vs. 2.6%; p=0., of myocardial infarction by 40% (1.7% vs. 2.9%; p=0., and of undergoing coronary revascularization procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) by 33% (3.2% vs. 4.8%; p=0  Trends in risk reduction associated with treatment with lovastatin immediate-release were consistent across men and women, smokers and non-smokers, hypertensives and non-hypertensives, and older and younger participants.  Participants with ≥2 risk factors had risk reductions (RR) in both acute major coronary events (RR 43%) and coronary revascularization procedures (RR 37%).  Because there were too few events among those participants with age as their only risk factor in this study, the effect of lovastatin immediate-release on outcomes could not be adequately assessed in this subgroup.\n- Atherosclerosis\n- In the Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (CCAIT), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary angiography in hyperlipidemic patients. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, patients were treated with conventional measures (usually diet and 325 mg of aspirin every other day) and either lovastatin 20 mg - 80 mg daily or placebo.  Angiograms were evaluated at baseline and at two years by computerized quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).  Lovastatin significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured by the mean change per-patient in minimum lumen diameter (the primary endpoint) and percent diameter stenosis, and decreased the proportions of patients categorized with disease progression (33% vs. 50%) and with new lesions (16% vs. 32%).\n a secondary endpoint.  By this endpoint, significant slowing of disease was seen, with regression in 23% of patients treated with lovastatin compared to 11% of placebo patients.\n- The effect of lovastatin on the progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries has been corroborated by similar findings in another vasculature.  In the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in hyperlipidemic patients with early carotid lesions and without known coronary heart disease at baseline.  In this double- blind, controlled clinical trial, 919 patients were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to placebo, lovastatin 10-40 mg daily and/or warfarin.  Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the change per patient from baseline to three years in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of 12 measured segments.  There was a significant regression of carotid lesions in patients receiving lovastatin alone compared to those receiving placebo alone (p=0  The predictive value of changes in IMT for stroke has not yet been established.  In the lovastatin group there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with major cardiovascular events relative to the placebo group (5 vs.  and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (1 vs. .\n- Eye\n- There was a high prevalence of baseline lenticular opacities in the patient population included in the early clinical trials with lovastatin immediate-release.  During these trials the appearance of new opacities was noted in both the lovastatin immediate-release and placebo groups.  There was no clinically significant change in visual acuity in the patients who had new opacities reported nor was any patient, including those with opacities noted at baseline, discontinued from therapy because of a decrease in visual acuity.\n- A three-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in hypercholesterolemic patients to assess the effect of lovastatin immediate-release on the human lens demonstrated that there were no clinically or statistically significant differences between the lovastatin immediate-release and placebo groups in the incidence, type or progression of lenticular opacities.  There are no controlled clinical data assessing the lens available for treatment beyond three years.\n\n【49】 # How Supplied\n- Lovastatin extended-release ts are supplied as round, convex shaped ts containing 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg of lovastatin.\n- NDC 59630-628-30: 20 mg extended-release orange-colored ts imprinted with Andrx logo and 20 on one side, bottles of 30.\n- NDC 59630-629-30: 40 mg extended-release peach-colored ts imprinted with Andrx logo and 40 on one side, bottles of 30.\n- NDC 59630-630-30: 60 mg extended-release light peach-colored ts imprinted with Andrx logo and 60 on one side, bottles of 30.\n\n【50】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20º-25°C (68º-77°F) - Excursions Permitted to 15°-30°C (59° -86°F) .

There is more than one form of ACD. In some families, a form of ACD known as alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) has been linked to the gene FOXF1 on chromosome 16 q24.1-q24.2.\n\n【3】 # Diagnosis\n- ACD commonly is diagnosed postmortem, by a pathologist.\n- Sometimes ACD is diagnosed clinically. This is common when there is a family history of ACD, but rare otherwise. A clinical differential diagnosis of ACD excludes fetal atelectasis.\n- ACD is not detecby prenatal imaging. However, some babies with ACD have associated congenital malformations that are detecby imaging.

Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.    On the basis of research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and many other organizations, it is widely believed that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders.\n show excessive health care utilization. In a 1998 study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were nearly 50% greater for workers reporting high levels of stress in comparison to “low risk” workers. The increment rose to nearly 150%, an increase of more than $1,700 per person annually, for workers reporting high levels of both stress and depression.\n- Additionally, periods of disability due to job stress tend to be much longer than disability periods for other occupational injuries and illnesses.\n\n【3】 # Causesof Workplace Stress\n- Job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of job stress. The differing viewpoints suggest different ways to prevent stress at work.\n- According to one school of thought, differences in individual characteristics such as personality and coping style are most important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress-in other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint leads to prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions.\n- Although the importance of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for a greater emphasis on working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy.\n, and 2000. Results showed a trend across these periods suggestive of increasing work intensity. In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-fourth of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60 % in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in  in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.\n- A substantial percentage of Americans work very long hours. By one estimate, more than 26% of men and more than 11% of women worked 50 hours per week or more in 2000. These s represent a considerable increase over the previous three decades, especially for women. According to the Department of Labor, there has been an upward trend in hours worked among employed women, an increase in extended work weeks (>40 hours) by men, and a considerable increase in combined working hours among working couples, particularly couples with young children.\n\n【4】 # Signsof Workplace Stress\n- Mood and sleep disturbances, upset stomach and headache, and disturbed relationships with family and friends are examples of stress-related problems.  The effects of job stress on chronic diseases are more difficult to see because chronic diseases take a long time to develop and can be influenced by many factors other than stress. Nonetheless, evidence is rapidly accumulating to suggest that stress plays an important role in several types of chronic health problems-especially cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychological disorders.\n\n【5】 # Prevention\n- A combination of organizational change and stress management is often the most useful approach for preventing stress at work.\n- How to Change the Organization to Prevent Job Stress\n- Ensure that the workload is in line with workers' capabilities and resources.\n- Design jobs to provide meaning, stimulation, and opportunities for workers to use their skills.\n- Clearly define workers' roles and responsibilities.\n- Give workers opportunities to participate in decisions and actions affecting their jobs.\n- Improve communications-reduce uncertainty about career development and future employment prospects.\n- Provide opportunities for social interaction among workers.\n- Establish work schedules that are compatible with demands and responsibilities outside the job.\n- St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company conducted several studies on the effects of stress prevention programs in hospital settings. Program activities included  employee and management education on job stress,  changes in hospital policies and procedures to reduce organizational sources of stress, and  establishment of employee assistance programs.\n- In one study, the frequency of medication errors declined by 50% after prevention activities were implemented in a 700-bed hospital. In a second study, there was a 70% reduction in malpractice claims in 22 hospitals that implemented stress prevention activities. In contrast, there was no reduction in claims in a matched group of 22 hospitals that did not implement stress prevention activities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:27:35"}

The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and it was one of the first proteins in which the F-box motif was identified.\n\n【2】 # Discovery and gene/protein characteristics\n identified cyclin F as a new cyclin during their search for new candidate genes for polycystic kidney. CCNF gene has 17 exons and is located at position 16p13.3 on the human chromosome. Its protein, cyclin F, is made up of 786 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 87 kDa. Cyclin F is the main member of the F-box protein family, which has about 40 amino acid motif, forming the F-box.\n- Cyclin F resembles most to cyclin A in terms of sequence and expression patterns. Moreover, it has additional shared features of cyclins, such as pEST region, protein quantity, localization, cell cycle-regulated mRNA, and ability to influence cell cycle and progression.  Cyclin F differs from other cyclins by its ability to monitor and regulate cell cycle without the need for cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Instead, cyclin F forms part of the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) and ubiquitinates or directly interacts with the target substrates through the F-box domain.\n\n【3】 # Expression patterns\n- Cyclin F mRNA is expressed in all human tissues, but at different quantities. It is found most abundantly in the nucleus, and the quantity levels vary during the different stages of cell cycle. Its expression pattern closely resembles the one from cyclin A. Cyclin F levels begin to rise during S phase and reaches its peak during G2.\n\n【4】 # Rolein DNAsynthesisandrepair\n- Cyclin F interacts with other enzymes that are important for DNA synthesis, stability and repair.\n\n【5】 # RRM2\n- RRM2 is a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides into dNTPs. dNTPs are essential for DNA synthesis during DNA replication and repair. Cyclin F interacts with RRM2 to control the production of dNTPs in the cell to avoid genomic instability and frequency of mutations.\n\n【6】 ## CP110\n- Moreover, cyclin F located at the centrosomes are needed to regulate levels of CP110, a protein involved in centrosome duplication. The regulation of CP110 during G2, through ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, helps to prevent mitotic aberrations. by allowing only one centrosome replication per cell cycle.\n\n【7】 # NuSAP\n- NuSAP is a substrate of cyclin F that is involved in cell division. It is a microtubule-associated protein that is required for the spindle assembly process. Its function is to interact with microtubules and chromatin to create stabilization and cross-linking. A lack of NuSAP has been linked with an increase in mutations due to impaired chromosome alignment during metaphase, while an excess of NuSAP leads to mitotic arrest and microtubule bundling. Cyclin F help to control NUSAP abundance and is therefore essential to proper cell division.\n- Therefore, a defective cyclin F may contribute to hypermutator phenotype and chromosomal instability through RRM2, CP110, and NuSAP pathways.\n\n【8】 # Clinical significance\n\n【9】 ## Neurodegenerative diseases\n carried out. It was found that certain CCNF mutations caused increased ubiquitination of TDP-43 protein in cells, which is a major feature of ALS and FTD pathology. In zebrafish, mutant CCNF fish showed motor neuron axonopathy and reduced motor response.\n\n【10】 ## Cancer\n- Cyclin F has a tumor suppressor role because normal expression is involved in cell cycle regulation by inducing G2 arrest and preventing mitosis. Moreover, cyclin F through RRM2 and CP110 control centrosome duplication and reduce the frequency of genomic mutations. So far, mutations in CCNF and increased RRM2 expression have been identified in several human cancers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:15:10"}

In an industrial egg-producing facility, about half of the newly hatched chicks will be male and would grow up to be roosters, which do not lay eggs and therefore there is no incentive for the breeder to keep alive. Most of the male chicks are usually killed shortly after birth.\n\n【1】 # History\n- Prior to the development of modern meat breeds, most male chickens (cockerels) would usually be slaughtered for meat, whilst females(pullets) would be kept for egg production. However, once farmers bred separate meat and egg breeds, it became apparent that there was no reason to keep males of the egg breed alive. As a result the males of every 'batch' of egg-laying chickens would be killed as soon as possible to reduce losses incurred by the breeder through the feeding and sheltering of them. Special techniques were developed to accurately determine the sex of chicks at as young an age as possible.\n\n【2】 # The culling of unwanted chicks\n- In industrial factory farms, Chicks that are not intended for rearing are culled shortly after their sex is determined, usually before they are 72 hours old. Chicks are generally killed through use of a mechanically operated apparatus approved for that purpose in accordance with national legislation.\n\n【3】 ## Methods\n- Several methods have been used to cull chicks:\n- Maceration, using a large high-speed grinder into which the chicks are thrown.\n- Gases or gas mixtures, often carbon dioxide is used to induce unconsciousness and then death.\n- Cervical dislocation, manually induced dislocation of the spinal column from the skull.\n- Burying alive.\n- Electrocution, a new method that has been touted as being cheap, reliable, and humane by its developers\n\n【4】 ## Recommended culling practices\n- The American Veterinary Medical Association recommends cervical dislocation and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide as the best options, but has recently amended their guidelines to include maceration.\n- The 2005-2006 American Vetinary Medical Association Executive Board held its final meeting July 13 in Honolulu, prior to the 2006 session of the House of Delegates and the AVMA Annual Convention.   It proposed a policy change, which was recommended by the Animal Welfare Committee on disposal of unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs. The new policy states, in part, \"Unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs should be killed by an accephumane method, such as use of a commercially designed macerator that results in instantaneous death. Smothering unwanted chicks or poults in bags or containers is not accep Pips, unwanted chicks, or poults should be killed prior to disposal. A pipped egg, or pip, is one where the chick or poult has not been successful in escaping the egg shell during the hatching process.\n\n【5】 # Controversy\n- Animal rights activists maintain that the practice of chicken slaughtering is inhumane. Many vegans cite this practice as part of the reason they avoid eating eggs. It is largely unknown by the public that the practice of chicken slaughtering takes place.

It aims to improve the diagnosis of gestational diabetes and help women with diabetes to self-manage their blood glucose levels before and during pregnancy.\n\n【2】 # Recommendations\n- People have the right to be involved in discussions and make in\n- Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\n\n【3】 # Blood glucose and plasma glucose\n'Blood glucose' is the more commonly used term. However, a lot of the evidence this guideline is based on uses 'plasma' rather than 'blood' glucose, and patient‑held glucose meters and monitoring systems are calibrated to plasma glucose equivalents. Because of this, in this guideline we use the term 'blood glucose', except when referring to specific concentration values.\n\n【4】 # Preconception planning and care\n\n【5】 ## Information about outcomes and risks for mother and baby\n- Provide information, advice and support, to empower women to have a positive experience of pregnancy and to reduce the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby.\n- Explain to women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy that:\n- if they have good blood glucose control before conception and throughout their pregnancy, this will reduce the risk of miscarriage, congenital malformation, stillbirth and neonatal death but\n- the risks can be reduced but not eliminated.\n- When women with diabetes are planning a pregnancy, provide them and their families with in\n- the role of diet, body weight and exercise\n- the risks of hypoglycaemia and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia during pregnancy\n- how nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect blood glucose control\n- the increased risk of having a baby who is large for gestational age, which increases the likelihood of birth trauma, induction of labour, and instrumental and caesarean section deliveries\n- the need for diabetic retinopathy assessment before and during pregnancy\n- the need for diabetic nephropathy assessment before pregnancy\n- the importance of maternal blood glucose control during labour and birth, and the need for early feeding of the baby, in order to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia\n- the possibility of that the baby may have health problems in the first 28 days, and may need admitting to a neonatal unit\n- the risk of the baby developing obesity, diabetes and/or other health problems in later life.\n\n【6】 ## The importance of planning pregnancy and the role of contraception\n- Emphasise the importance of planning for pregnancy, as part of diabetes education from adolescence for women with diabetes.\n- Explain to women with diabetes that their choice of contraception should be based on their own preferences and any risk factors (covered in the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare UK medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use).\n- Advise women with diabetes that they can use oral contraceptives.\n- Advise women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant:\n- that the risks associated with diabetes in pregnancy will increase the longer they have had diabetes\n- to use contraception until they have good blood glucose control (assessed by HbA1c levels – see recommendation 1.1.\n- that blood glucose targets, glucose monitoring, medicines for treating diabetes (including insulin regimens) and medicines for complications of diabetes will need to be reviewed before and during pregnancy\n- that extra time and effort is needed to manage diabetes during pregnancy, and that more frequent contact is needed with healthcare professionals.\n- \n\n【7】 ## Diet, dietary supplements and body weight\n- Offer individualised dietary advice to women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy.\n the NICE guideline on BMI for guidance on using variations on the BMI cut-off, based on the risk for different ethnic groups.\n- Advise women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy to take folic acid (5 mg/day) until 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.\n\n【8】 ## Monitoring blood glucose and ketones before pregnancy\n- Offer up to monthly measurement of HbA1c levels for women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy.\n- Offer blood glucose meters for self-monitoring to women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy.\n- If a woman with diabetes who is planning a pregnancy needs to intensify blood glucose‑lowering therapy, advise her to monitor her blood glucose more often, to include fasting levels and a mixture of pre‑meal and post‑meal levels.\n- Offer blood ketone testing strips and a meter to women with type 1 diabetes who are planning a pregnancy, and advise them to test for ketonaemia if they become hyperglycaemic or unwell.\n\n【9】 # Targetbloodglucoseand HbA1clevelsbeforepregnancy\n- Agree individualised targets for self‑monitoring of blood glucose with women who have diabetes and are planning a pregnancy, taking into account the risk of hypoglycaemia.\n- Advise women with type 1 diabetes who are planning a pregnancy to aim for the normal capillary plasma glucose target ranges:\n- a fasting plasma glucose level of 5 mmol/litre to 7 mmol/litre on waking and\n- a plasma glucose level of 4 mmol/litre to 7 mmol/litre be\n- Advise women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy to aim to keep their HbA1c level below 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), if this is achievable without causing problematic hypoglycaemia.\n- Reassure women that any reduction in HbA1c level towards the target is likely to reduce the risk of congenital malformations in the baby.\n- Strongly advise women with diabetes whose HbA1c level is above 86 mmol/mol (10%) not to get pregnant until their HbA1c level is lower, because of the associated risks .\n\n【10】 ## Safety of medicines for diabetes before and during pregnancy\n- Women with diabetes may be advised to use metformin as an adjunct or alternative to insulin in the preconception period and during pregnancy, when the likely benefits from improved blood glucose control outweigh the potential for harm. Stop all other oral blood glucose‑lowering agents before pregnancy, and use insulin instead.\n- Be aware that the available evidence on rapid‑acting insulin analogues (aspart and lispro) does not show an adverse effect on the pregnancy or the health of baby.\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\n\n【11】 ## Safety of medicines for complications of diabetes before and during pregnancy\n- Stop angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin‑II receptor antagonists before conception, or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Use alternative antihypertensive agents that are suifor pregnant women.\n- Stop statins before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.\n\n【12】 ## Making it easier for women to access preconception care\n- From adolescence onwards, at every contact with women with diabetes:\n- healthcare professionals (including the diabetes care team) should explain the benefits of preconception blood glucose control\n- the diabetes care team should record the plans women have for pregnancy and conception.\n- Provide preconception care for women with diabetes in a supportive environment, and encourage partners or other family members to attend.\n\n【13】 ## Education and advice\n- As early as possible, offer a structured education programme to women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy (if they have not already attended one). \n- Offer preconception care and advice before stopping contraception for women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy.\n\n【14】 ## Retinal assessment before pregnancy\n- For women with diabetes who are seeking preconception care, offer a retinal assessment at their first appointment (unless they have had a retinal assessment in the last 6 months).\n- Advise women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy to defer rapid optimisation of blood glucose control until after they have had retinal assessment and treatment.\n\n【15】 ## Renal assessment before pregnancy\n- Offer women with diabetes a renal assessment (including a measure of albuminuria) before stopping contraception.\n- Consider referring women with diabetes to a nephrologist before stopping contraception if:\n- serum creatinine is 120 micromol/litre or more or\n- the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio is greater than 30 mg/mmol or\n- the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 45 ml/minute/1.73 m2.\n\n【16】 # Gestational diabetes\n\n【17】 ## Risk assessment, testing and diagnosis\n- To help women make an informed decision about risk assessment and testing for gestational diabetes, explain that:\n- some women find that gestational diabetes can be controlled with changes in diet and exercise\n- most women with gestational diabetes will need oral blood glucose‑lowering agents or insulin\n- if gestational diabetes is not detected and controlled, there is a small increase in the risk of serious adverse birth complications such as shoulder dystocia\n- women with gestational diabetes will need more monitoring, and may need more interventions during pregnancy and labour.\n- Assess the risk of gestational diabetes using risk factors in a healthy population. At the booking appointment, check for the following risk factors:\n- BMI above 30 kg/m2\n- previous macrosomic baby weighing 4.5 kg or more\n- previous gestational diabetes\n- family history of diabetes (first‑degree relative with diabetes)\n- an ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes.Offer women with any of these risk factors testing for gestational diabetes .\n- Do not use fasting plasma glucose, random blood glucose, HbA1c, glucose challenge test or urinalysis for glucose to assess the risk of developing gestational diabetes.\n- Consider further testing to exclude gestational diabetes in women who have the following reagent strip test results during routine antenatal care:\n- glycosuria of 2+ or above on 1 occasion\n- glycosuria of 1+ or above on 2 or more occasions.\n- Use the 75-g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to test for gestational diabetes in women with risk factors .\n- For women who have had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, offer:\n- early self‑monitoring of blood glucose or\n- a 75-g 2‑hour OGTT as soon as possible after booking (whether in the first or second trimester), and a further 75-g 2‑hour OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the results of the first OGTT are normal.\n- Offer women with any of the other risk factors for gestational diabetes  a 75-g 2‑hour OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks.\n- Diagnose gestational diabetes if the woman has either:\n- a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/litre or above or\n- a 2‑hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/litre or above.\n- When women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes:\n- ffer a review with the joint diabetes and antenatal clinic within 1 week.\n- tell their primary healthcare team .\n\n【18】 ## Interventions\n- Explain to women with gestational diabetes:\n- the implications (both short and long term) of the diagnosis for her and her baby (including UK government advice on driving with diabetes)\n- that good blood glucose control throughout pregnancy will reduce the risk of fetal macrosomia, trauma during birth (for her and her baby), induction of labour and/or caesarean section, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and perinatal death\n- that treatment includes changes in diet and exercise, and could involve medicines.\n- Teach women with gestational diabetes how to self‑monitor their blood glucose.\n- Use the same capillary plasma glucose target levels for women with gestational diabetes as for women with pre‑existing diabetes .\n- Tailor blood glucose‑lowering therapy to the blood glucose profile and personal preferences of the woman with gestational diabetes.\n- When women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, offer advice about changes in diet and exercise.\n- Advise women with gestational diabetes to eat a healthy diet during pregnancy, and to switch from high to low glycaemic index food.\n- Refer all women with gestational diabetes to a dietitian.\n- Advise women with gestational diabetes to exercise regularly (for example, walking for 30 minutes after a meal).\n- For women with gestational diabetes who have a fasting plasma glucose level below 7 mmol/litre at diagnosis, offer a trial of diet and exercise changes.\n- If blood glucose targets are not met with diet and exercise changes within 1 to 2 weeks, offer metformin.\n- If metformin is contraindicated or unaccepto the woman, offer insulin.\n- If blood glucose targets are not met with diet and exercise changes plus metformin, offer insulin as well.\n- For women with gestational diabetes who have a fasting plasma glucose level of 7.0 mmol/litre or above at diagnosis, offer:\n- immediate treatment with insulin, with or without metformin and\n- diet and exercise changes.\n- For women with gestational diabetes who have a fasting plasma glucose level of between 6.0 and 6.9 mmol/litre and complications such as macrosomia or hydramnios, consider:\n\n【19】 # Antenatal care for women with diabetes\n the NICE guideline on antenatal care for uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\n【20】 ##

The equivalent values in %, using the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)‑aligned HbA1c test, are reported in parentheses.\n\n【45】 ## Level 2 critical care\n- Care for patients who need detailed observation or intervention, including support for a single failing organ system, postoperative care, and patients 'stepping down' from higher levels of care.# Recommendations for research\n- The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.\n\n【46】 # Key recommendations for research\n\n【47】 ## Preconception care for women with diabetes: insulin pump therapy and real-time continuous glucose monitoring\n- What are the roles of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) and real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) in helping women with diabetes to achieve blood glucose targets before pregnancy?\n- Babies born to women with diabetes have a high risk of having congenital malformations and this risk is greater if blood glucose control is poor around the time of conception. However, lowering the risk to that of women without diabetes would require normalisation of blood glucose levels, and this is difficult to achieve without increasing the risk of serious hypoglycaemia. Insulin pump therapy and rtCGM have been shown to reduce both blood glucose levels and rates of hypoglycaemia in the non‑pregnant population, but it is uncertain if this holds true before conception and in early pregnancy. There is therefore an urgent need to test the effectiveness and acceptability of these technologies in women with diabetes who are planning pregnancy. This would be best undertaken in a randomised controlled trial of women with diabetes who are trying to conceive. Women would be allocated to receive either conventional care (self‑monitoring of blood glucose and insulin adjustment) or insulin pump therapy and rtCGM.\n\n【48】 ## Testing for gestational diabetes\n- When should testing for gestational diabetes take place – in the first or second trimester?\n- Conventionally, testing for gestational diabetes takes place in the second trimester. Intervention has been shown to improve outcomes for women diagnosed with gestational diabetes. However, maternal age and obesity are increasing, and some women (especially those from populations with a high incidence of type 2 diabetes) enter pregnancy with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, but may not be tested for diabetes until the second trimester. This exposes the woman and the fetus to risks resulting from early and prolonged maternal hyperglycaemia. It is presumed that this is associated with increased morbidity. UK population studies are needed to establish the incidence of glucose intolerance in women in the first trimester. Well‑designed randomised controlled trials are needed to establish if testing, diagnosis and intervention in the first rather than the second trimester improves maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes, including fetal hyperinsulinaemia.\n\n【49】 ## Barriers to achieving blood glucose targets before and during pregnancy\n- What are the barriers that women experience to achieving blood glucose targets?\n helps to prevent macrosomia and other complications in the third trimester in women with pre‑existing or gestational diabetes. Whereas many women manage to achieve blood glucose targets, a proportion of women continue to find it difficult to do so. A number of factors could be involved, such as health beliefs, a poor understanding of the importance of good blood glucose control, an inability to be able to comply with a demanding regimen of blood glucose testing up to 7 times a day, and the need to adjust insulin dosage. A better understanding of the barriers in this cohort of women is needed so that healthcare professionals can work to overcome them. Robust qualitative studies are needed to explore these barriers, with the aim of improving blood glucose control and fetal outcomes in pregnancy for women with pre‑existing diabetes and women with gestational diabetes.\n\n【50】 ## Risk of fetal death for women with diabetes\n- How can fetuses at risk of intrauterine death be identified in women with diabetes?\n- Unexpected intrauterine death remains a significant contributor to perinatal mortality in pregnant women with diabetes. Conventional tests of fetal wellbeing (umbilical artery doppler ultrasound, cardiotocography and other biophysical tests) have been shown to have poor sensitivity for predicting such events. Alternative approaches that include measurements of erythropoietin in the amniotic fluid and MRI spectroscopy may be effective, but there is currently insufficient clinical evidence to evaluate them. Well‑designed randomised controlled trials that are sufficiently powered are needed to determine whether these approaches are clinically and cost effective.\n\n【51】 ## Postnatal treatment for women diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n- Are there effective long‑term pharmacological interventions to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes that can be recommended postnatally for women who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes?\n- Gestational diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes: up to 50% of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years of the birth. There are some data suggesting that changes in diet and exercise, with or without metformin, can prevent type 2 diabetes developing in non‑pregnant middle‑aged people with glucose intolerance, but there are no studies specifically in women with a past history of gestational diabetes. There is thus an urgent need to investigate what interventions may delay or prevent type 2 diabetes developing in this high‑risk population of women. Undertaking a formal randomised controlled trial involving long‑term outcomes is often not feasible in practice. However, it would be possible to have a quasi‑randomised study comparing 2 populations of women with similar demographic profiles who had gestational diabetes. One population would be encouraged at their annual check to follow a specific diet and exercise regime and those in the other population would not. The incidence of the development of type 2 diabetes in the 2 groups at 5 years, 10 years and 20 years would be compared.# Rationale and impact\n- These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n\n【52】 # Continuous glucose monitoring\n- \n\n【53】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n- There was evidence comparing real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) with intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) and with intermittent capillary glucose monitoring, for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.\n- When compared with intermittent capillary glucose monitoring, rtCGM resulted in:\n- more women achieving their blood glucose targets\n- fewer caesarean sections\n- fewer neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions.\n- One retrospective study was identified that compared isCGM with rtCGM. This study showed no clear difference between the 2 monitoring systems in maternal and neonatal outcomes.\n- Health economic modelling found that isCGM clearly has the lowest overall cost of the 3 options. It is much less certain that isCGM provides the most benefit (a finding that is in line with the clinical evidence). The committee were concerned by the very low quality of the evidence for isCGM, the accuracy of isCGM (particularly in the hypoglycaemic range) and the number of finger-pricks that would still be needed to use isCGM safely.\n- The committee agreed that all the uncertainties in the evidence would be likely to lead to the benefits of isCGM being overestimated. Therefore, they could not be confident that isCGM represents a better use of NHS resources than rtCGM, which had been shown in high-quality evidence to have better outcomes than intermittent capillary glucose monitoring and a 94% chance of being cheaper in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.\n- Based on these findings, the committee recommended that rtCGM should be offered to all women with type 1 diabetes to help women meet their pregnancy blood glucose targets and improve neonatal outcomes.\n noted that some women may be unable to use rtCGM or may prefer using isCGM instead. In these situations they recommended offering isCGM.\n- The committee amended the 2015 recommendation on considering rtCGM for pregnant women who are on insulin therapy but do not have type 1 diabetes because they wanted to identify specific scenarios in which rtCGM could be considered.\n- The committee believed that education and support are important for pregnant women using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), to ensure they get the full benefit. Therefore, they updated and expanded the 2015 recommendation on providing support.\n\n【54】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n- Use of CGM varies across the country, but most centres offer isCGM and/or rtCGM to pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (in accordance with the NHS long-term plan). Because of this, the recommendations are unlikely to cause a major shift in practice.\n- # Context\n increasing as a result of higher rates of obesity in the general population and more pregnancies in older women.\n- Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with risks to the woman and to the developing fetus. Miscarriage, pre‑eclampsia and preterm labour are more common in women with pre‑existing diabetes. In addition, diabetic retinopathy can worsen rapidly during pregnancy. Stillbirth, congenital malformations, macrosomia, birth injury, perinatal mortality and postnatal adaptation problems (such as hypoglycaemia) are more common in babies born to women with pre‑existing diabetes.\n- This guideline contains recommendations for managing diabetes and its complications in women who are planning pregnancy and those who are already pregnant. The guideline focuses on areas where additional or different care should be offered to women with diabetes and their newborn babies. Where the evidence supports it, the guideline makes separate recommendations for women with pre‑existing diabetes and women with gestational diabetes.

Aspirin will not prevent hemorrhagic strokes (strokes caused by bleeding in the brain). Aspirin is in a group of medications called salicylates. It works by stopping the production of certain natural substances that cause fever, pain, swelling, and blood clots.\n available in combination with other medications such as antacids, pain relievers, and cough and cold medications. This monograph only includes in\n\n【4】 # How this medicine should be used\n- Prescription aspirin comes as an extended-release t t that releases medication slowly over a period of time). Nonprescription aspirin comes as a regular t, an enteric-coated, delayed-release t t that first begins to release medication some time after it is taken), a chewable t, and a gum to take by mouth and a suppository to use rectally. Prescription aspirin is usually taken two or more times a day. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken once a day to lower the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken every 4–6 hours as needed to treat fever or pain. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aspirin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.\n- Swallow the extended-release ts whole with a full glass of water. Do not break, crush, or chew them.\n- Swallow the ts with a full glass of water.\n- Chewable aspirin ts may be chewed, crushed, or swallowed whole. Drink a full glass of water, immediately after taking these ts.\n- Ask a doctor before you give aspirin to your child or teenager. Aspirin may cause Reye's syndrome (a serious condition in which fat builds up on the brain, liver, and other body organs) in children and teenagers, especially if they have a virus such as chicken pox or the flu.\n- If you have had oral surgery or surgery to remove your tonsils in the last 7 days, talk to your doctor about which types of aspirin are safe for you.\n- Delayed-release ts begin to work some time after they are taken. Do not take delayed-release ts for fever or pain that must be relieved quickly.\n- Stop taking aspirin and call your doctor if your fever lasts longer than 3 days, if your pain lasts longer than 10 days, or if the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen. You may have a condition that must be treated by a doctor.\n- To insert an aspirin suppository into the rectum, follow these steps:\n- Remove the wrapper.\n- Dip the tip of the suppository in water.\n- Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (If you are left-handed, lie on your right side and raise your left knee.)\n- Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch in infants and children and 1 inch in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.\n- Do not stand up for at least 15 minutes. Then wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.\n\n【5】 # Other uses for this medicine\n sometimes used to lower the risk of blood clots in patients who have artificial heart valves or certain other heart conditions and to prevent certain complications of pregnancy.\n\n【6】 # special precautions that should be followed\n- Before taking aspirin:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to aspirin, other medications for pain or fever, tartrazine dye, or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: acetazolamide (Diamox); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril, (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin) and heparin; beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); diuretics ('water pills'); medications for diabetes or arthritis; medications for gout such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); methotrexate (Trexall); other non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); phenytoin (Dilantin); and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you more carefully for side effects.\n- if you are taking aspirin on a regular basis to prevent heart attack or stroke, do not take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to treat pain or fever without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably tell you to allow some time to pass between taking your daily dose of aspirin and taking a dose of ibuprofen.\n- tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, frequent stuffed or runny nose, or nasal polyps (growths on the linings of the nose). If you have these conditions, there is a risk that you will have an allergic reaction to aspirin. Your doctor may tell you that you should not take aspirin.\n- tell your doctor if you often have heartburn, upset stomach, or stomach pain and if you have or have ever had ulcers, anemia, bleeding problems such as hemophilia, or kidney or liver disease.\n- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy, you plan to become pregnant, or you are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking aspirin, call your doctor. Aspirin may harm the fetus and cause problems with delivery if it is taken during the last few months of pregnancy.\n- if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking aspirin.\n- if you drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day, ask your doctor if you should take aspirin or other medications for pain and fever.\n\n【7】 # special dietary instructions\n- Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet\n\n【8】 # What to do if you forget a dose\n- If your doctor has told you to take aspirin on a regular basis and you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n【9】 # Side Effects\n\n【10】 ## minor side effects\n- Aspirin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- stomach pain\n- heartburn\n\n【11】 ## severe side effects\n- Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n- hives\n- rash\n- swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat\n- wheezing or difficulty breathing\n- hoarseness\n- fast heartbeat\n- fast breathing\n- cold, clammy skin\n- ringing in the ears\n- loss of hearing\n- bloody vomit\n- vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds\n- bright red blood in stools\n- black or tarry stools\n- Aspirin may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you experience any unusual problems while you are taking this medication.\n- If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online  or by phone .\n\n【12】 # Storage Conditionsforthis Medication\n- Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store aspirin suppositories in a cool place or in a refrigerator. Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed and any ts that have a strong vinegar smell. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication.\n\n【13】 # In case of emergency/overdose\n- In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911.\n- Symptoms of overdose may include:\n- burning pain in the throat or stomach\n- vomiting\n- decreased urination\n- fever\n- restlessness\n- irritability\n- talking a lot and saying things that do not make sense\n- fear or nervousness\n- dizziness\n- double vision\n- uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body\n- confusion\n- abnormally excited mood\n- hallucination \n- seizures\n- drowsiness\n- loss of consciousness for a period of time\n\n【14】 # Other Information\n- Keep all appointments with your doctor.\n- If you are taking prescription aspirin, do not let anyone else take your medication.

The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.\n- For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50–400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage at temperatures lower than recommended.\n\n【7】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【8】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Testosterone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【9】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Testosterone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【10】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【11】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.\n\n【12】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【13】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Testosterone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Testosterone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 # Contraindications\n- Known hypersensitivity to the drug\n- Males with carcinoma of the breast\n- Males with known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate gland\n- Women who are or who may become pregnant\n- Patients with serious cardiac, hepatic or renal disease\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- Hypercalcemia may occur in immobilized patients. If this occurs, the drug should be discontinued.\n- Prolonged use of high doses of androgens (principally the 17-α alkyl-androgens) has been associated with development of hepatic adenomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and peliosis hepatis —all potentially life-threatening complications.\n- Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.\n- There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone cypionate. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone cypionate and initiate appropriate workup and management.\n- Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone cypionate.\n- Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal or hepatic disease.\n- Gynecomastia may develop and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism.\n- The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events, including the \"gasping syndrome\", and death in pediatric patients. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product ordinarily deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the hepatic capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity.\n- Androgen therapy should be used cautiously in healthy males with delayed puberty. The effect on bone maturation should be monitored by assessing bone age of the wrist and hand every 6 months. In children, androgen treatment may accelerate bone maturation without producing compensatory gain in linear growth. This adverse effect may result in compromised adult stature. The younger the child the greater the risk of compromising final mature height.\n- This drug has not been shown to be safe and effective for the enhancement of athletic performance. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse health effects, this drug should not be used for such purpose.\n\n【17】 ## Precautions\n\n【18】 ### General\n- Patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy may develop acute urethral obstruction. Priapism or excessive sexual stimulation may develop. Oligospermia may occur after prolonged administration or excessive dosage. If any of these effects appear, the androgen should be stopped and if restarted, a lower dosage should be utilized.\n- Testosterone cypionate should not be used interchangeably with testosterone propionate because of differences in duration of action.\n- Testosterone cypionate is not for intravenous use.\n\n【19】 ### Laboratory tests\n- Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (to detect polycythemia) should be checked periodically in patients receiving long-term androgen administration.\n- Serum cholesterol may increase during androgen therapy.\n\n【20】 # Drug/Laboratorytest Interferences\n- Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.\n\n【21】 # Drug Abuseand Dependence\n\n【22】 # Controlled Substance Class\n- Testosterone is a controlled substance under the Anabolic Steroids Control Act, and testosterone Injection has been assigned to Schedule III.\n\n【23】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【24】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following adverse reactions in the male have occurred with some androgens:\n- Endocrine and urogenital: Gynecomastia and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages.\n- Skin and appendages: Hirsutism, male pattern of baldness, seborrhea, and acne.\n- Cardiovascular Disorders: myocardial infarction, stroke.\n- Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium, and inorganic phosphates.\n- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests, rarely hepatocellular neoplasms and peliosis hepatis.\n- Hematologic: Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X, bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy, and polycythemia.\n- Nervous system: Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia.\n- Allergic: Hypersensitivity, including skin manifestations and anaphylactoid reactions.\n- Vascular disorders: Venous thromboembolism.\n- Miscellaneous: Inflammation and pain at the site of intramuscular injection.\n\n【25】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding postmarketing experience.\n\n【26】 # Drug Interactions\n- Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may require reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia.\n- Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.\n- In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.\n\n【27】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【28】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA): X\n- Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Testosterone (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【29】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Testosterone (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【30】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Testosterone is not recommended for use in nursing mothers.\n\n【31】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.\n\n【32】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) in geriatric settings.\n\n【33】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【34】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【35】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【36】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【37】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Testosterone (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【38】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Testosterone (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【39】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【40】 ### Administration\n- Intramuscular.\n\n【41】 ### Monitoring\n- The effect on bone maturation should be monitored by assessing bone age of the wrist and hand every 6 months.\n\n【42】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility.\n\n【43】 # Overdosage\n- There have been no reports of acute overdosage with the androgens.\n\n【44】 # Pharmacology\n\n【45】 ## Mechanism of Action\n cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein.\n- Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for eventual termination of linear growth, brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of the growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate production of red blood cells by enhancing production of erythropoietic stimulation factor.\n be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).\n- There is a lack of substantial evidence that androgens are effective in fractures, surgery, convalescence, and functional uterine bleeding.\n\n【46】 ## Structure\n- Testosterone Injection, for intramuscular injection, contains testosterone cypionate which is the oil-soluble 17 (beta)- cyclopentylpropionate ester of the androgenic hormone testosterone.\n- Testosterone cypionate is a white or creamy white crystalline powder, odorless or nearly so and sin air. It is insoluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol, chloroform, dioxane, ether, and soluble in vegeoils.\n- The chemical name for testosterone cypionate is androst-4-en-3-one, 17-(3-cyclopentyl-1-oxopropoxy)-, (17β)-. Its molecular formula is C27H40O3, and the molecular weight 412.61.\n- The structural formula is represented below:\n- Testosterone Injection is available in two strengths, 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL testosterone cypionate.\n- Each mL of the 100 mg/mL solution contains:\n- Testosterone cypionate 100 mg\n- Benzyl benzoate 0.1 mL\n- Cottonseed oil 736 mg\n- Benzyl alcohol (as preservative) 9.45 mg\n- Each mL of the 200 mg/mL solution contains:\n- Testosterone cypionate 200 mg\n- Benzyl benzoate 0.2 mL\n- Cottonseed oil 560 mg\n\n【47】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There is limited information regarding pharmacodynamics.\n\n【48】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. Testosterone esters in oil injected intramuscularly are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase; thus, testosterone cypionate can be given at intervals of two to four weeks.\n- Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about 2 percent is free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half-life.\n- About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways.\n- The half-life of testosterone cypionate when injected intramuscularly is approximately eight days.\n- In many tissues the activity of testosterone appears to depend on reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is transported to the nucleus where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.\n\n【49】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n\n【50】 ### Carcinogenesis\n- Animal data\n known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats.\n- Human data\n- There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases.\n- Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.\n\n【51】 # Clinical Studies\n- There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies.\n\n【52】 # How Supplied\n- Testosterone Injection is available as follows:\n100 mg/mL\n10 mL vials                    NDC 0009-0347-02\n200 mg/mL\n1 mL vials                      NDC 0009-0417-01\n10 mL vials                    NDC 0009-0417-02\n\n【53】 ## Storage\n- Vials should be stored at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) .

Inability to hold urine in the bladder due to loss of voluntary control over the bladder (detrusor) muscle and/or urinary sphincters resulting in the involuntary passage of urine.\n fecal incontinence.\n\n【2】 # Classification\n- Urinary incontinence can be broadly classified into 5 major types. They are stress incontinence, urge incontinence, overflow incontinence, mixed incontinence, functional incontinence.\n\n【3】 # Causes\n be caused by congenital and acquired neurological, muscular, and renal conditions.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- Continence and micturition involve a balance between outlet (urethra) and bladder detrusor muscle activity. Lower urinary tract function is often divided into filling and voiding phases.  Normally as the bladder fills the detrusor is compliant - stretching and increasing the volume it holds - without any unpleasant sensation and the outlet is closed.  At a socially acceptime and place to void the bladder (detrusor) contracts and the outlet relaxes and flow ensues. Any perturbation in that balance can lead to voiding dysfunction or incontinence.  Abnormal detrusor muscle activity or hypersensitivity of the bladder can lead to urge incontinence.  An incompetent outlet can lead to stress incontinence.  A bladder that cannot contract may lead to overflow incontinence.\n\n【5】 # Differential diagnosis\n urinary incontinence should be differentiated from other conditions like stroke, multiple sclerosis, parkinson's disease, fecal impaction, rectal prolapse etc.\n\n【6】 # Epidemiology and demographics\n\n【7】 # Risk Factors\n\n【8】 # Screening\n\n【9】 # Natural history, complications and prognosis\n- Common complications of urinary incontinence include increased risk of falling and fractures, urinary tract infection, sleep disorders, depression. The prognosis associated with urinary incontinence depends on the underlying cause and associated conditions such as accurate diagnosis, and proper treatment.\n\n【10】 # Diagnosis\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic study of choice\n\n【12】 ## History and symptoms\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\n- The physical examination will focus on looking for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, such as tumors that block the urinary tract, stool impaction, and poor reflexes or sensations, which may be evidence of a nerve-related cause.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory findings\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\n\n【16】 ## X-ray\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography and ultrasound\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\n\n【19】 # MRI\n\n【20】 ## Other imaging findings\n\n【21】 ## Other diagnostic studies\n\n【22】 ## Medical therapy\n- Medications can reduce many types of urine leakage. Some drugs inhibit contractions of an overactive bladder. Others relax muscles, leading to more complete bladder emptying during urination. Some drugs tighten muscles at the bladder neck and urethra, preventing leakage. And some, especially hormones such as estrogen, are believed to cause muscles involved in urination to function normally.In vaginal atrophy - topical or vaginal estrogens; tolterodine, oxybutynin, propantheline, darifenacin, solifenacin, trospium in urge incontinence, imipramine in mixed and stress urinary incontinence, pseudoephedrine and duloxetine in stress urinary incontinence", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:19:52"}

Subdural empyema may be classified according to location of the infection into 2 groups: intracranial and spinal, with intracranial being the more common of the two groups, accounting for 95% of subdural empyema patients. Subdural empyema accounts for approximately 15-25% of focal central nervous system infections. In 2014, the incidence of subdural empyema was estimated to be less than 1 case case per 100,000 individuals, with a male predominance.\n- The most common pathogens in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic Streptococci, compared to spinal subdural epmyema, which can be caused by either Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. If left untreated, subdural empyema frequently evolves into severe fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma, and subsequent mortality. Complications to subdural empyema include status epilepticus, neurological deficits, and thrombosis. Prognosis is generally good with antimicrobial therapy. Physical examination of patients with subdural empyema is usually remarkable for fever, facial pain, and altered mental status. MRI is the primary imaging study of epidural abscess, with CT scan as a secondary alternative. Treatment of subdural empyema requires a combined medical and surgical approach. In order to evacuate the pus, burr hole placement or craniotomy may be used to treat the subdural empyema. The preferred surgical mainstay of treatment for subdural empyema is craniotomy.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- In 1869, subdural empyema was first operated on by François Gigot de la Peyronie. The first detailed description of the disease was by Cyril Brian Courville in 1939.\n\n【3】 # Classification\n- Subdural empyema may be classified according to location of the infection into 2 groups: intracranial and spinal.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- Subdural empyema is a localized collection of pus between the dura mater and arachnoid mater, occurring in either the intracranial space or the spinal canal. Subdural empyema generally follows the same progression for both intracranial and spinal subtypes, spreading via blood or from nearby infection. Bacterial infections of the skull or air sinuses can spread to the subdural space, producing a subdural empyema. The underlying arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces are usually unaffected, but a large subdural empyema may produce a mass effect.\n\n【5】 # Causes\n- Common causes of subdural empyema include Streptococci, Staphylococci, and other Gram-negative bacilli. In children, the majority of cases of subdural empyema occur due to meningitis, while in adults the most common causes are sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis, and trauma.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Subdural Empyemafrom Other Diseases\n- Subdural empyema must be differentiated from other diseases that cause fever, headache, focal neurological signs, seizures, and altered mental status, such as subdural hematoma, brain abscess, and bacterial meningitis. These conditions may be distinguished from subdural empyema by their clinical findings, brain imaging findings, and laboratory studies.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Subdural empyema accounts for approximately 15-25% of focal central nervous system infections. In 2014, the incidence of subdural empyema was estimated to be less than 1 case per 100,000 individuals. Prior to antibiotics, the case fatality rate of subdural empyema was estimated to be near 100%. However, with antibiotics, the current rate is estimated between 10-20%. The disease usually occurs in children and young adults (70% cases occurring in the second and third decades of life), being more frequent in men than women, possibly due to sex-related differences in sinus anatomy.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\n- Common risk factors in the development of subdural empyema are meningitis, sinusitis, otitis, mastoiditis, immunodeficiency, head trauma, and lumbar puncture.\n\n【9】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n- If left untreated, subdural empyema frequently evolves into severe fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma, and subsequent mortality. Complications to subdural empyema include status epilepticus, neurological deficits, and thrombosis. Prognosis is generally good with antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【10】 # Diagnosis\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\n- If possible, a detailed and thorough history from the patient is necessary. Specific areas of focus when obtaining a history from the patient include prior neurosurgery, sinusitis, or mastoiditis. Common symptoms of subdural empyema include headache, altered mental status, vomiting, and seizures.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\n- Physical examination of patients with subdural empyema is usually remarkable for fever, facial pain, and altered mental status.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- Laboratory findings associated with subdural empyema are generally unspecific. Often, elevated inflammatory markers are present, including:\n- Leukocytes\n- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n- C-reactive protein\n\n【14】 ## Lumbar Puncture\n- Lumbar puncture is not diagnostic of subdural empyema. Lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure which is contraindicated in case of suspicion of subdural empyema and increased intracranial pressure, due to risk of brain herniation, and mortality.\n\n【15】 ## X ray\n- Generally, x ray is not helpful in the diagnosis of subdural empyema.\n\n【16】 ## CT\n- Head CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of subdural empyema. CT scan is secondary to MRI for subdural empyema imaging. Findings on CT scan suggestive of subdural empyema include a crescentic shape, although collection pockets may appear bi-convex. A surrounding membrane that enhances intensely and uniformly following contrast administration is typically identified.\n\n【17】 # MRI\n demonstrate restricted diffusion.\n\n【18】 # Treatment\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\n- Subdural empyema is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment. Treatment of subdural empyema requires a combined medical and surgical approach. Empiric antimicrobial therapy depends on the location of the infection (intracranial vs. spinal) and whether it was community-acquired or hospital-acquired. The clinical symptoms may be mild and unspecific initially.\n\n【20】 ## Surgery\n- Subdural empyema is a neurosurgical condition, which requires emergency surgical drainage and subsequent medical therapy. In order to evacuate the pus, burr hole placement or craniotomy may be used to treat the subdural empyema. The preferred surgical mainstay of treatment for subdural empyema is craniotomy. A wide craniotomy allows a wide exposure of the area, adequate exploration, and better evacuation of the infected material and decompression of the underlying cerebral hemisphere, thereby improving the outcome.\n\n【21】 ## Prevention\n- Effective measures for the primary prevention of subdural empyema include rapid treatment of inflammatory diseases of the head and prevention of trauma. Secondary prevention strategies following subdural empyema include treatment and management of existing infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-09 22:22:46"}

Patients could switch to oral therapy after a minimum of 4 days of IV treatment if clinical improvement was demonstrated.  Patients known to have bacteremia at baseline were excluded.  Patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) between 30 and 70 mL/min were to receive a lower dose of CUBICIN as specified in the protocol; however, the majority of patients in this subpopulation did not have the dose of CUBICIN adjusted.\n- One trial was conducted primarily in the United States and South Africa (study , and the second was conducted at non-US sites only (study .  The two trials were similar in design but differed in patient characteristics, including history of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease.  There were a total of 534 patients treated with CUBICIN and 558 treated with comparator in the two trials.  The majority (89.7%) of patients received IV medication exclusively.\n- The efficacy endpoints in both trials were the clinical success rates in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and in the clinically evaluable (CE) population.  In study 9801, clinical success rates in the ITT population were 62.5% (165/ in patients treated with CUBICIN and 60.9% (162/ in patients treated with comparator drugs.  Clinical success rates in the CE population were 76.0% (158/ in patients treated with CUBICIN and 76.7% (158/ in patients treated with comparator drugs.

In this trial, adult patients with at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study drug and irrespective of source were enrolled and randomized to either CUBICIN (6 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard of care .  Of the patients in the comparator group, 93% received initial gentamicin for a median of 4 days, compared with 1 patient (<1%) in the CUBICIN group.  Patients with prosthetic heart valves, intravascular foreign material that was not planned for removal within 4 days after the first dose of study medication, severe neutropenia, known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bloodstream infections, creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, and pneumonia were excluded.\n- Upon entry, patients were classified for likelihood of endocarditis using the modified Duke criteria (Possible, Definite, or Not Endocarditis).  Echocardiography, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), was performed within 5 days following study enrollment.  The choice of comparator agent was based on the oxacillin susceptibility of the S. aureus isolate.  The duration of study treatment was based on the investigator's clinical diagnosis.  Final diagnoses and outcome assessments at Test of Cure (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) were made by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee, using protocol-specified clinical definitions and a composite primary efficacy endpoint (clinical and microbiological success) at the Test of Cure visit.\n- A total of 246 patients ≥18 years of age (124 CUBICIN, 122 comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe.  In the ITT population, 120 patients received CUBICIN and 115 received comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin).  Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin initially for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the S. aureus isolates.  The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30/120 (25%) in the CUBICIN group and 37/115 (32%) in the comparator group were ≥65 years of age.  Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups.  In addition, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to onset of the S. aureus bacteremia.  Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).  Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised 37 (16%) Definite, 144 (61%) Possible, and 54 (23%) Not Endocarditis.  Of the 37 patients with an entry diagnosis of Definite Endocarditis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and of the 144 patients with an entry diagnosis of Possible Endocarditis, 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.  Of the 54 patients with an entry diagnosis of Not Endocarditis, 1 (2%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.\n- In the ITT population, there were 182 patients with bacteremia and 53 patients with infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee, including 35 with right-sided endocarditis and 18 with left-sided endocarditis.  The 182 patients with bacteremia comprised 121 with complicated S. aureusbacteremia and 61 with uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia.\n- Complicated bacteremia was defined as S. aureus isolated from blood cultures obtained on at least 2 different calendar days, and/or metastatic foci of infection (deep tissue involvement), and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria.  Uncomplicated bacteremia was defined as S. aureus isolated from blood culture(s) obtained on a single calendar day, no metastatic foci of infection, no infection of prosthetic material, and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria.  The definition of right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) used in the clinical trial was Definite or Possible Endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria and no echocardiographic evidence of predisposing pathology or active involvement of either the mitral or aortic valve.  Complicated RIE comprised patients who were not intravenous drug users, had a positive blood culture for MRSA, serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL, or evidence of extrapulmonary sites of infection.  Patients who were intravenous drug users, had a positive blood culture for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), had serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL, and were without evidence of extrapulmonary sites of infection were considered to have uncomplicated RIE.\n- The coprimary efficacy endpoints in the trial were the Adjudication Committee success rates at the Test of Cure visit (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) in the ITT and Per Protocol (PP) populations.  The overall Adjudication Committee success rates in the ITT population were 44.2% (53/ in patients treated with CUBICIN and 41.7% (48/ in patients treated with comparator (difference = 2.4% ).  The success rates in the PP population were 54.4% (43/ in patients treated with CUBICIN and 53.3% (32/ in patients treated with comparator (difference = 1.1% ).\n- Adjudication Committee success rates are shown in \n- Eighteen (18/ patients in the CUBICIN arm and 19/116 patients in the comparator arm died during the trial.  These comprise 3/28 CUBICIN-treated patients and 8/26 comparator-treated patients with endocarditis, as well as 15/92 CUBICIN-treated patients and 11/90 comparator-treated patients with bacteremia.  Among patients with persisting or relapsing S. aureus infections, 8/19 CUBICIN-treated patients and 7/11 comparator-treated patients died.\n- Overall, there was no difference in time to clearance of S. aureus bacteremia between CUBICIN and comparator.  The median time to clearance in patients with MSSA was 4 days and in patients with MRSA was 8 days.\n- Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus infections was assessed by the Adjudication Committee in 19/120 (16%) CUBICIN-treated patients (12 with MRSA and 7 with MSSA) and 11/115 (10%) comparator-treated patients (9 with MRSA treated with vancomycin and 2 with MSSA treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin).  Among all failures, isolates from 6 CUBICIN-treated patients and 1 vancomycin-treated patient developed increasing MICs (reduced susceptibility) by central laboratory testing during or following therapy.

About 96% of those affected are male.  Prune belly syndrome is a congenital disorder of the urinary system, characterized by a triad of symptoms.  The syndrome is named for the mass of wrinkled skin that is often (but not always) present on the abdomens of those with the disorder.  Other names for the syndrome include Abdominal Muscle Deficiency Syndrome, Congenital Absence of the Abdominal Muscles, Eagle-Barrett Syndrome, Obrinsky Syndrome, Fröhlich Syndrome, or rarely, Triad Syndrome.\n\n【3】 # Symptoms\n- A partial or complete lack of abdominal muscles.  There may be wrinkly folds of skin covering the abdomen.\n- Undescended testicles in males\n- Urinary tract abnormality such as unusually large ureters, distended bladder, accumulation and backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters and the kidneys\n- Frequent urinary tract infections due to the inability to properly expel urine.\n\n【4】 # Diagnosis\n- Prune belly syndrome can be diagnosed via ultrasound while a child is still in-utero.  An abnormally large abdominal mass is the key indicator, as the abdomen swells with the pressure of accumulated urine.  In young children, frequent urinary tract infections often herald prune belly syndrome, as they are normally uncommon.  If a problem is suspected, doctors can perform blood tests to check kidney function.  Another test that may reveal the syndrome is the \"voiding cystourethrogram,\" in which a catheter is inserted into the urethra to fill the bladder with dye.  An X-ray can detect if urine has a reverse flow into the ureters and kidneys .\n result in the distending and enlarging of internal organs such as the bladder and intestines. Surgery is often required to return these organs to their natural sizes.\n- A genetic predisposition has been suggested, and PBS is much more common when the baby is a twin, although all reported twin births have been discordant.\n\n【5】 # Treatment\n- The type of treatment, like that of most disorders, depends on the severity of the symptoms. One option is to perform a vesicostomy, which allows the bladder to drain through a small hole in the abdomen. A more drastic procedure is a surgical \"remodeling\" of the abdominal wall and urinary tract. Boys may have an orchiopexy, which moves the testicles to their proper place in the scrotum.\n- Even with treatment, many patients experience renal failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#3#3#Undescended testicles in males......to properly expel urine.这里是一句话", "type3": "无关文本#1#1#Please Join in Editing This Page and Apply to be an Editor-In-Chief for this topic:与正文无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-09 19:43:38"}

Within the core of the complex, the chlorophyll and beta-carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins CP43 (PsbC) and CP47 (PsbB), which pass the excitation energy on to the reaction centre proteins D1 (Qb, PsbA) and D2 (Qa, PsbD) that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process. The PSII oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) oxidises water to provide protons for use by PSI, and consists of OEE1 (PsbO), OEE2 (PsbP) and OEE3 (PsbQ). The remaining subunits in PSII are of low molecular weight (less than 10 kDa), and are involved in PSII assembly, stabilisation, dimerisation, and photo-protection.\n- Cytochrome b559, which forms part of the reaction centre core of PSII is a heterodimer composed of one alpha subunit (PsbE), one beta (PsbF) subunit, and a haem cofactor. Two histidine residues from each subunit coordinate the haem. Although cytochrome b559 is a redox-active protein, it is unlikely to be involved in the primary electron transport in PSII due to its very slow photo-oxidation and photo-reduction kinetics. Instead, cytochrome b559 could participate in a secondary electron transport pathway that helps protect PSII from photo-damage. Cytochrome b559 is essential for PSII assembly.\n- This domain occurs in both the alpha and beta subunits of cytochrome B559. In the alpha sbunit it occurs together with a lumenal domain (InterPro: IPR, while in the beta subunit it occurs on its own.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-09 21:55:05"}

Patients found to have a fungal infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days; treatment should continue for at least 7 days after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms are resolved. If the 50-mg dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg.\n- Candidemia and Other Candida Infections\n- A single 70-mg loading dose should be administered on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be dictated by the patient's clinical and microbiological response. In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. Patients who remain persistently neutropenic may warrant a longer course of therapy pending resolution of the neutropenia.\n- Esophageal Candidiasis\n- The dose is 50 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days after symptom resolution. A 70-mg loading dose has not been studied for this indication. Because of the risk of relapse of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with HIV infections, suppressive oral therapy could be considered.\n- Invasive Aspergillosis\n- A single 70-mg loading dose should be administered on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based upon the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.\n\n【5】 # Recommended Dosingin Pediatric Patients\n- For all indications, a single 70-mg/m2 loading dose should be administered on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m2 once daily thereafter. The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. Dosing in pediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) should be based on the patient's body surface area (BSA) as calculated by the Mosteller Formula:\n- Following calculation of the patient's BSA, the loading dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m X 70 mg/m2. The maintenance dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m X 50 mg/m2.\n- Duration of treatment should be individualized to the indication, as described for each indication in adults. If the 50-mg/m2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed 70 mg).\n\n【6】 # Patientswith Hepatic Impairment\n- Adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to  do not need a dosage adjustment. For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to , CANCIDAS 35 mg once daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data. However, where recommended, a 70-mg loading dose should still be administered on Day 1. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > and in pediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.\n\n【7】 # Patients Receiving Concomitant Inducersof Drug Clearance\n- Adult patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg of CANCIDAS once daily. Adult patients on nevirapine, efavirenz, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, or phenytoin may require an increase in dose to 70 mg of CANCIDAS once daily.\n- When CANCIDAS is co-administered to pediatric patients with inducers of drug clearance, such as rifampin, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a CANCIDAS dose of 70 mg/m2 once daily (not to exceed 70 mg) should be considered.\n\n【8】 # Preparationand Reconstitutionfor Administration\n- Do not mix or co-infuse CANCIDAS with other medications, as there are no data available on the compatibility of CANCIDAS with other intravenous substances, additives, or medications. DO NOT USE DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE (α-D-GLUCOSE), as CANCIDAS is not sin diluents containing dextrose.\n\n【9】 # Preparationof CANCIDASfor Infusion\n- Each vial of CANCIDAS contains an intentional overfill of CANCIDAS. Thus, the drug concentration of the resulting solution is listed in  below.\n- The white to off-white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discoloration during reconstitution and prior to infusion. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.\n- The reconstituted solution may be stored for up to one hour at ≤25°C (≤77°F).\n- CANCIDAS vials are for single use only; the remaining solution should be discarded.\n- This infusion solution must be used within 24 hours if stored at ≤25°C (≤77°F) or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).\n- Special Considerations for Pediatric Patients >3 Months of Age\n- Follow the reconstitution procedures described above using either the 70-mg or 50-mg vial to create the reconstituted solution. From the reconstituted solution in the vial, remove the volume of drug equal to the calculated loading dose or calculated maintenance dose based on a concentration of 7 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 70-mg vial) or a concentration of 5 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 50-mg vial).\n- The choice of vial should be based on total milligram dose of drug to be administered to the pediatric patient. To help ensure accurate dosing, it is recommended for pediatric doses less than 50 mg that 50-mg vials (with a concentration of 5 mg/mL) be used if available. The 70-mg vial should be reserved for pediatric patients requiring doses greater than 50 mg.\n- The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:13:45"}

The main cause of epidural hematoma is typically head injury that results in a break of the temporal bone and bleeding from the middle meningeal artery in the epidural space. Because the bleeding is caused by arterial rupture, it has a high tendency to progress and it causes a hematoma in epidural space. Progression of bleeding may expand the hematoma and cause increasing of the intracranial pressure and it may lead to brain herniation. Occasionally epidural hematoma may occur as a result of a Bleeding disorders or blood vessel malformation or after CNS surgery or lumbar acupunctures or Spinal injections or metastatic cancer and sometimes is may occur spontaneously.\n\n【3】 # Causes\n- The leading cuase of epidural hematoma is head trauma. Other common causes of epidural hematoma include: Spinal trauma,  bleeding disorders, blood vessel malformation, CNS surgery, dengue virus infection, lumbar acupunctures, spinal injections, metastatic cancer, sickle cell anemia and kummell's disease.\n\n【4】 # Differentiating Xyzfrom Other Diseases\n- Epidural hematoma must be differentiated from other diseases that cause severe headache such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, Subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, intracranial mass, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, intracranial venous thrombosis, migraine, pituitary apoplexy, and lymphocytic hypophysitis.\n\n【5】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Epidural hematoma occurs in approximately 2000 per 100,000 of patients with head injury. Epidural hematoma is the cause of 5% to 15% of fatal head injuries. Approximately 85% to 95% of patients with epidural hematoma have an overlying skull fracture. The in-hospital mortality rate of epidural hematoma in young patients with epidural hematoma is approximately 4800 per 100,000 individuals with a case-mortality rate of 4.8%. Patients of all age groups may develop epidural hematoma as the main cause of epidural hematoma is traumatic head injury. There is no racial predilection to epidural hematoma.Epidural hematoma affects men and women equally.\n\n【6】 # Risk Factors\n- The most potent risk factor in the development of epidural hematoma is Head trauma. Other risk factors include: Spinal trauma, bleeding disorders, anticoagulant drugs usage, blood vessel malformation, CNS surgery, lumbar acupunctures ,spinal injections, metastatic cancer, sickle cell anemiaand kummell's disease.\n\n【7】 # Screening\n- There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for epidural hematoma.\n\n【8】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n- If left untreated, patients with epidural hematoma may progress to develop permanent paraplegia, loss of sensation, brain herniation, coma and death. Common complications of epidural hematoma include: brain herniation, death, post-traumatic seizures, visual problems, persistent paraplegia, Coma, loss of sensation, priapism, disturbed circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid and Urinary retention. Prognosis is generally good in patients treated surgically without delay. In patients with acute epidural hematoma the surgery in an interval under two hours leads to 17% mortality rate and 67% of good recoveries but in patients who recover after an interval of more than two hours the mortality rate is 65% and good recovery rate is 13%. Overall mortality rate of patients with epidural hematoma is approximately 25%. The percentages of overall good recoveries and minimal neurologic deficit in patients with epidural hematoma is approximately 58%. The prognosis is worse in older patients and in patients with concomitant injuries of other body regions.\n\n【9】 # Diagnosis\n\n【10】 # Diagnostic Studyof Choice\n- The CT scan is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of epidural hematoma. The following findings on performing CT scan are confirmatory for epidural hematoma: Bi-convex , capping of epidural fat, direct continuity with the adjacent osseous structures and compression of epidural fat, subarachnoid sac, and spinal cord. MRI is sensitive for diagnosis of intracranial epidural hematoma but it is rarely used for diagnosis of it because of its limited availability and because more time is needed to prepare the patients for MRI.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\n- Patients with epidural hematoma may have a positive history of: Head trauma, spinal trauma, Bleeding disorders, blood vessel malformation and NS surgery. In traumatic cases of epidural hematoma, patients may develop signs and symptoms right after trauma, or weeks after that. Some patients with epidural hematoma may experience a lucid interval which is a period of time in which patient regains consciousness after a short period of unconsciousness. after lucid interval the sign and symptoms of epidural hematoma may get worse. The most common symptoms of epidural hematoma include: Severe headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness or altered level of alertness, enlarged pupils, weakness and slurred speech. Less common symptoms of epidural hematoma include: seizures, unconsciousness and visual disturbance. As the hematoma expands, epidural bleeds can become large and raise intracranial pressure, causing the brain herniation in which the brain stem may be compressed and causing unconsciousness, bradycardia and irregular respiration or apnea.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\n- Findings in physical examination of patients with epidural hematoma may vary depend on the site and size of the hematoma. In patients with cranial epidural hematoma various focal neurologic signs may be seen depend on the site of hematoma. Physical examination of patients with cranial epidural hematoma is usually remarkable for loss of consciousness, unilateral diminished deep tendon reflexes, unilateral fixed mydriasis and abnormal pupillary reflex, down and out positioned eyes, loss of vision in contralateral side of hematoma and abnormal vertical gaze, unilaterally muscle weakness and unilateral sensory loss.\n- Glasgow coma scale in most patients with epidural hematoma is reduced. In patients with brain herniation due to the epidural hematoma respiratory arrest and Cushing's triad(hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration) may be seen. Findings in neck examination of patients with spinal epidural hematoma is usually include stiffness and tenderness.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\n be considered in all patients with epidural hematoma, including: A complete blood count to check for thrombocytopenia, Coagulation studies (PTT, PT/INR) to check for coagulopathy and Basic metabolic panel to check for electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n【14】 ## Electrocardiogram\n- There are no ECG findings associated with epidural hematoma.\n\n【15】 ## X-ray\n- Linear fractures in the cranial bones may be presesnt in skull X ray in patients with traumatic cranial epidural hematoma.\n\n【16】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\n- There are no echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with epidural hematoma.\n\n【17】 ## CT scan\n- The CT scan is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of epidural hematoma. The following findings on performing CT scan are confirmatory for epidural hematoma: Bi-convex (or lentiform) shaped hematoma in epidural space which can cross the dural reflections unlike a subdural hematoma but it does not cross skull's suture lines where the dura tightly adheres to the adjacent skull, depressed skull fracture in some cases of epidural hematoma, midline shift of brain tissue, subfalcine herniation and uncal herniation. Among patients with head trauma CT scan is indicated for detecting epidural hematoma and other kind of intracranial hemorrhages in patients with: age > 60 years, glasgow Coma Scale under 15, Headache, Vomiting, Loss of consciousness, Amnesia, alcohol or drug intoxication. Screening for cervical spinal hematoma by CT scan is recommended among patients with acute onset of hemiparesis, specially when they are associated with neck pain.\n\n【18】 # MRI\n- MRI is the preferred imaging study for diagnosis of spinal epidural hematoma. In patients with spinal epidural hematoma findings on MRI suggestive of spinal epidural hematoma include: A variable signal intensity( Isointensity to cord in T1-weighted images and Hyperintensity with areas of hypointensity in T2-weighted images), capping of epidural fat, direct continuity with the adjacent osseous structures and compression of epidural fat, subarachnoid sac, and spinal cord. MRI is sensitive for diagnosis of intracranial epidural hematoma but it is rarely used for diagnosis of it because of its limited availability and because more time is needed to prepare the patients for MRI.\n\n【19】 # Other Imaging Findings\n- There are no widely used other imaging findings associated with epidural hematoma.\n\n【20】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n- There are no widely used other diagnostic studies associated with epidural hematoma.\n\n【21】 # Treatment\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The mainstay of treatment for epidural hematoma is urgent surgery.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\n- Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for epidural hematoma. An epidural hematoma greater than 30 cm3 should be surgically evacuated regardless of the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. An epidural hematoma less than 30 cm3 and with less than a 15-mm thickness and with less than a 5-mm midline shift in patients with a GCS score greater than 8 without focal deficit can be managed nonoperatively with serial computed tomographic scanning and close neurological observation in a neurosurgical center. Acute epidural hematoma with a small amount of bleeding(less than 50 mL)may be treated by minimal invasive surgery methods which avoids craniotomy.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the primary prevention of epidural hematoma.\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of epidural hematoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-09 19:25:40"}

Mostly, it is a self-limited disorder, with acute short term symptoms like vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait impairment, with complete recovery in most patients. Another common condition associated with labyrinthitis is anxiety, which produces tremors, palpitations, panic attacks, and depression. in many cases, panic attacks and anxiety are the first symptoms to be associated with labyrinthitis.\n\n【2】 # Classification\n cause labyrinthitis . This type of disease is the most prevalent.\n- Bacterial labyrinthitis: This is second most common after viral infections, often, occurring as a complication of infection in the middle ear,(otitis media). Often, there is sudden unilateral hearing loss, dizziness, and vertigo. These are more prevalent in children than in adults. The best treatment approach is with antibiotics, which successfully manages the bacterial labyrinthitis and causes full recovery.\n- Autoimmune labyrinthitis: This type of labyrinthitis is rare and lesser prevalent than others.\n- Conditions causing damage to the cochlea inside your inner ear like meningitis, circulatory problems, or Ménière’s disease.\n- Tympanogenic labyrinthitis: It is secondary to middle ear disease (rare intratemporal complication of otitis media). It is rare due to early diagnosis and treatment of  otitis media with antibiotics now a days.\n\n【3】 # Differential diagnosis\n- Conditions which mimic Labyrinthitis are:\n- Meniere's disease\n- Migraine headache\n- Stroke\n- Intracranial hemorrhage (intralabyrinthine hemorrhage)\n- Damage to the vascular structures in the neck\n- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\n- Brain tumor(schwannoma)\n\n【4】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Adults in the age group of 30 to 60 years are most commonly affected. The incidence of labyrinthitis is around 3.5 cases per 100,000.\n- Viral labyrinthitis, the most common type, is more prevalent in adults, whereas the other types of infections affect the children on a larger scale. This can be assessed by the fact that children under the age of two are more predisposed to develop bacterial labyrinthitis.\n- Bacterial labyrinthitis is overall, less prevalent than other causes.\n\n【5】 # Risk Factors\n- Certain conditions can increase the risk of labyrinthitis:\n- Upper respiratory tract infections\n- Infections of the middle ear\n- Meningitis\n- Head injuries\n- Respiratory illnesses like bronchitis\n- Viral infections, like herpes and measles\n- Autoimmune diseases\n\n【6】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n- The symptoms of labyrinthitis usually start suddenly. Occasionally the patient wakes up with these symptoms and they are progressive.\n- There is usually a relief in the symptoms after a few days. Often, the loss of balance is restored in a couple of weeks, but in some cases, it can take longer.\n- In some severe and rare cases, there can be a permanent loss of hearing.\n- Certain factors like cold, previous illnesses, fatigue, menstruation, and respiratory infections can worsen the symptoms.\n- Complications following labyrinthitis includes: labyrinthine fistula, meningitis, cerebellar abscess, mastoiditis etc\n\n【7】 ## Recovery\n- The recovery from an attack of labyrinthitis follows the following phases:\n- An acute period, which includes symptoms like vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.\n- subacute symptoms, which last for a couple of weeks, followed by a rapid recovery\n- chronic compensation, which extends over a period of a couple of months or even years.\n\n【8】 # Diagnosis\n\n【9】 # Diagnostic Studyof Choice\n- Viral labyrinthitis could be a clinical diagnosis. But a variety of diagnostic tests are performed to rule out other diseases. Tests that may rule out other causes of your symptoms include:\n- EEG\n known as caloric stimulation.\n- CT Scan of the head: to rule out mastoiditis.\n- Temporal bone CT scan: diagnostic techniques in patients with cholesteatoma.\n- Rinne and Weber hearing tests\n- Head MRI\n- Eye test\n- Blood pressure\n- Assessment of balance\n- Culture and sensitivity of the middle ear effusions.\n- Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials to assess vestibular activity\n- Gadolinium-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging\n\n【10】 ## History and Symptoms\n- Labyrinthitis can be suspected when bone conduction loss co-exists with otitis media\n- Labyrinthitis is characterized by the following symptoms and signs including :\n- Dizziness\n- Vertigo\n- Instability of gait\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Tinnitus or ringing in the ears\n- Hearing loss particularly of the high-frequency range\n- Nystagmus\n\n【11】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- Labyrinthitis could be a clinical diagnosis. As a result, routine blood tests don't seem to be helpful in making any diagnosis. However, if systemic infection is suspected, FBC and blood cultures are indicated.\n\n【12】 # Treatment\n- Viral labyrinthitis causes a sudden onset of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sudden hearing impairment. As we know that the antibiotics are not effective against viruses, we must adopt the symptomatic treatment techniques, including medications for vertigo, antihistaminics, and complete rest. With all these measures, the patient usually feels better in  a week or two. Nevertheless, acute episodes can sometimes last for up to months. Apart from that, most people will have a full recovery after an episode of viral labyrinthitis if proper and timely vestibular rehabilitation exercises are adopted.\n- Bacterial labyrinthitis can be effectively treated with antibiotics preventing long term complications\n\n【13】 ## Certain emergency conditions which warrant immediate medical attention are\n- loss of consciousness\n- Convulsions or seizures\n- Speech abnormalities\n- Fever\n- Weakness\n- Stroke\n- Vision disorders like diplopia\n\n【14】 ## Medical Therapy\n- Symptomatic patients need treatment with the following:\n- Antihistamines, whic include drugs like desloratadine and loratadine\n- Antivertigo medications, such as meclizine\n- Sometimes we need to give sedatives to the patienst to ensure rest and recovery, such as diazepam\n- Corticosteroids, like prednisone\n commonly prescribed, which helps to alleviate symptoms of vertigo and nausea.\n- As we know that, sometimes an attack or anxiety or panic attack can aggravate the symptoms of labyrnthitis, it becomes imperative to treat an anxiety disorder and/or depression, simultaneously with the medication for otehr symptoms, to treat any vestibular damage. This can be achieved with benzodiazepines like diazepam (Valium); but caution should be taken to avoid long term usage of these drugs due to associated addiction with this class of drugs and their interference with the vestibular system (Solomon and Shepard, . Likewise the efficacy of corticosteroids such as prednisone, to treat early stages of labyrnthitis has been advocated and they are very frequently used for proper recovery, along with some antiviral medication. It should be understood that the treatment should be started as soon as possible to prevent any permanent damage to the inner ear.\n\n【15】 ## Interventions\n- Apart from medical therapy, we can use several lifestyle techniques to relieve vertigo associated with labyrinthitis:\n- Avoiding sudden or jerky movements or any sudden changes in body position\n- Rest during the attack and avoid any movements\n- Smooth and slow movements when trying to get up from lying\n- Avoiding prolonged exposure to screens, and abstain from bright lights in lieu of an attack\n- Keeping the head still, while sitting in a chair\n- Stress management techniques, to mitigate and factors which can aggravate the anxiety or stressors\n- Warm compresses can be used to bring relief from the pain\n- Avoiding smoking and limiting the intake of alcohol\n\n【16】 ## Primary Prevention\n- Resting in a cool dark place, if experiencing any symptoms like dizziness or vertigo\n- Drinking plenty of fluids and adequate hydration\n- Avoiding loud noises and exposure to bright lights which can aggravate the symptoms\n- Adequate sleep, as lack of sleep can bring on an attack\n\n【17】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- Implementation of therapies to allow rehabilitation and improve balance, like physical and occupational therapy\n- Vestibular rehabilitation: This includes various exercises performed under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist, which helps to improve the gait, movements, and functionality. It substantially reduces any residual symptoms from the attack of labyrinthitis. It helps with balancing and makes everyday activities easier.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:32:54"}

It contains the same active ingredients but in higher concentrations than other parts of the plant such as the buds or the leaves. Psychoactive effects vary between types of hashish but are usually the same as those of other cannabis preparations such as marijuana. Hash is generally prohibited to the same extent as all other forms of cannabis.\n- Hashish is often a solid or paste-like substance, of varying hardness and pliability, and will soften under heat. Its color can vary from green, black, reddish brown, or  most commonly light to dark brown.\n- It is consumed in much the same way as cannabis buds, used by itself in miniature smoking pipes, vaporized, hot knifed, smoked in a bong or bubbler, or smoked in joints mixed with tobacco, cannabis buds or other herbs.\n be eaten alone (pure hash is described as having a spicy or peppery flavor) as well as used as an ingredient in food (baked into cookies or cakes, or added to stews and chocolate). Sale of hashish is illegal under federal law in United States and in most parts of the world; it has been decriminalized to some extent in a few countries, such as the Netherlands.\n\n【1】 # History\n has a very long social tradition in the production of Hashish which is locally known as Charas. Traditionally, Cannabis sativa subsp. indica grows wild almost everywhere in the Indian sub-continent and special strains have been particularly cultivated for production of 'ganja' and 'hashish' particularly in Kerala, Rajasthan and the Himalayas. The earliest hashish was created without the use of sieves. The ancients would gently rub their palms and fingers on cannabis buds for hours while resin accumulated on their hands and then scrape that resin off. This sort of primitive harvesting is undertaken even today in the Cannabis growing farms of Manali, Naggar and Upper Himachal Pradesh. The earliest use of hashish was most likely from farmers scraping resin off of their hands after a day's harvest of commercial hemp and at that time hashish was normally eaten, not smoked.\n in Syria where they came across the  European Crusaders exercising a great influence upon them. In 1071, Hassan had joined the Ishmaelites whose members spread far and wide from Morocco to China and Zanzibar.\n- Eventually, the  Templars would fall prey to the king of France,  Philip the Fair, and the Assassin's leader would be slain by order of the  Great Khan\\.\"Comparison of the general administration of the two orders -opponents though they were for a time in Syria- reveals much wherein they were virtually identical\".  Production of hash later spread to the Middle East (Lebanon), and from there to North Africa (most prominently Algeria, though in post-colonial times Moroccan production has dominated) and then South Asia (mostly in India and Pakistan).\n been suggested that if hashish were in fact consumed, it had been adulterated with stronger materials, the effects of hashish being well-known and easily recognizable at that time and place.  No reports of statistical linkage between hashish and assassins or terror have been published anywhere in the last century.\n- Consumption of hashish saw an increase in the 20th century, in Europe and America, associated with the hippie scene.  Hashish use declined significantly in the United States starting in the 1980s for several reasons, including U. S. political pressures against Afghanistan and the ensuing Soviet invasion, a huge jump in price, and the success of marijuana cultivators in North America with new growing methods for increasing THC production, such as growing marijuana indoors.\n\n【2】 # Manufacturing processes\n- Hashish is made from tetrahydrocannabinol-rich glandular hairs known as trichomes, as well as varying amounts of cannabis flower and leaf fragments. The flowers of a mature female plant contain the most trichomes, though trichomes are found on other parts of the plant. Certain strains of cannabis are cultivated specifically for their ability to produce large amounts of trichomes. The resin reservoirs of the trichomes, sometimes erroneously called pollen, are separated from the plant through various methods. The resulting concentrate is formed into blocks of hashish, which can be easily stored and transported. Alternatively, the powder consisting of uncompressed, dry  trichomes is often referred to as kief instead of hashish.\n be collected passively through cleaning of scissors that have been used to cut the plant, or containers like a kief-box used to store it.\n- Ice water separation is a more modern mechanical separation method which submerges the plant in ice and water and stirs the mixture.  Trichomes are broken off the plant as the ice moves, while the low temperature make the trichomes more brittle so they break off easily.  The waste plant matter, detached trichomes, and water are separated by filtering through a series of increasingly fine screens. Kits are commercially available which provide a series of filter screens meant to fit inside standard bucket sizes. Hash made in this way is sometimes called ice hash, or bubble hash.\n dissolves in butter, which can then be used for cooking .  The product of chemical separations is more commonly referred to as honey oil, hash oil, or just oil. Some believe that hash oil is best avoided, due both to the dangerous nature of its production and the fear of residual chemicals left in the oil by the solvent.\n\n【3】 # Quality\n- The main factors affecting quality are potency and purity. Different cannabis plants will produce resins with unique chemical profiles that vary in potency. Some forms of hashish are described as producing a \"body high\" while others are more \"cerebral\". This depends on the genetic strain and relative amount of different cannabis plants used as well as the manufacturing process involved.\n- Tiny pieces of leaf matter or even purposefully added adulterants introduced when the hash is being produced will reduce the purity of the material. The THC content of hashish usually ranges from 15–20%, and that of hash oil from 30–40%.\n- Fresh hashish of good quality is soft and pliable and becomes progressively harder and less potent as it oxidizes.\n hashish of greenish or reddish hue. A green tinge may indicate that the hashish is impure, has been cut with low-quality leaf or contains high quantities of chlorophyll.  A yellow tint can indicate presence of cannabis pollen, which has a sandy color.\n- Low quality forms of hash often contain adulterants used as cutting agents added to exaggerate the value of hash through increasing the mass or including other cheaper drugs Such forms usually possess a low potency, may have an unpleasant strangeness in taste and feel, and produce hard, dark \"cinders\" in the ash which should be soft and white. Adulterants in hash may range from waste material from the cannabis plant (generally not harmful) to products such as food oils and soap, hence the name soap bar. The low quality may lead one to smoke more to get the same effect, increasing exposure to carbon monoxide and adverse effects upon the lungs.\n- A general rule of thumb is that good hashish produces effects which should be rapidly, unmistakably apparent, even with experienced users who have developed tolerance to THC; being unsure of the effects or wanting to use more within a short amount of time means the hashish is either very weak and/or, more likely, adulterated.\n- Some users have started boiling their hash in water for a few minutes and then drying it before smoking. This is thought to remove all water-soluble adulterants while the psychoactive cannabinols remain intact as the temperature is not sufficient to destroy them and they are not soluble in water.\n- The smoke and ashes of burnt hash should be light gray or white in color. Dark, acrid smoke and poor ease of inhaling smoke signify that the material is contaminated. It is always best to compost any such unaccephashish rather than continue using it in hopes of achieving a high.\n\n【4】 # Hashish by region\n\n【5】 ## Production\n- Hashish is traditionally produced in desert conditions. It is traditionally found in a belt extending from North Africa , Egypt to North  India and into Central Asia. The primary hash-producing countries are Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Morocco, Lebanon and India.\n- Charas is the primary product.  Charas, a substance that is hand-rubbed directly from the cannabis plant, is generally produced in Nepal and India. Today, the word charas is common word for hash in a majority of India, despite the fact that other methods may be used than the hand-rubbed method.\n- A visitor to the Rif Mountains and the town of Ketama in Morocco in December 1976 described the production of hashish. Workers rubbed the leaves of the cannabis plant over fine muslin fabric. In unheated huts, each worker had his hands and arms inside a regular one hundredweight (50 kg) plastic fertiliser bag containing twigs and leaves of the cannabis plant. In the mouth of the bag was a plastic washing-up bowl. Stretched over the bowl was a sheet of \"zero-zero\" grade muslin. The worker rubbed the leaves of the cannabis plant over the muslin, resulting in a fine powder ending up in the bowl. When 100 grams of the powder was collected it was then wrapped in more fine muslin, put onto a heated metal plate, and rolled down with a bottle. This process produced a slightly sticky solid brown mass in the form of a square slab, around half the size of a paperback book and about ½ cm thick. This block was wrapped in cellophane. Sellers of this Moroccan hashish pointed to the imprint of the muslin on the surface of the block, and declared it proof that the product was \"zero-zero\", top quality.\n- In Afghanistan there is a method of making hash that resembles charas. First, cannabis resin is placed on a large heated mortar, then the resin is threshed with a heavy object. The result is a very gooey, sticky black hash. This method is mostly used in villages around the Hindu Kush mountain region.\n produced now in the deserts of northern Mexico; however, the demand for it and thus amount produced is insignificant compared to that for \"fresh\" Mexican marijuana, especially into the lucrative North American market.\n\n【6】 ## Consumption\n- Hashish was always the variety of preference in Europe (although this preference is slowly changing towards the buds of the plant) , it is basically the exclusive form of THC in the Middle East and was widely available in North Africa and parts of Asia. It is less preferred by cannabis users in the US and other producing nations. Hashish is more compact than marijuana, it keeps better, and is easier to smuggle than marijuana. When it has been smuggled by amateurs, it often suffers from long periods of bad storage, so the quality can vary considerably. Older hashish can easily be recognized as it is hard and has no smell (heating with a lighter is a common test).\n- By the 1990s, the use of marijuana in the developed world was increasing, as more potent versions were being grown. The Cannabis Cup held every year in Amsterdam attempts to evaluate the quality of the latest varieties.\n a name for heroin in some parts of the UK), hash, resin, solid, and block. In the Netherlands, this is called Hasj or Assi (although coffee shops will maintain a wide variety of types, i.e.: Polm, Blond, Tempel Bol, Isolator, Zero-Zero or Waterwerks, generally relating to either the method of production, country of origin or type of marijuana used.). In Brazil, it is commonly called haxa. Also, there is a branch of nearly white powder hash (pollen or kief hash) that is the result of not stamping the raw material for the more common compressed hashish.\n- Soft hash is usually dark brown to black in color and goes under the name black in France, squidgey or soft black (named due to the color and properties of the hash) in the UK. The very potent Paki Black is so named because it originates in Pakistan. Soft, dark hash in the Netherlands is normally referred to as Afghan. Common Kashmiri brands are Citral and Fungus.\n- Hashish use is experiencing a resurgence in parts of North America (especially the Pacific Northwest) with the use and commercial availability of ice-water extraction kits.\n\n【7】 # Preparation and methods of use\n be eaten or vaporised.\n- Hash is sometimes prepared for smoking by heating it with a flame for a couple of seconds, producing some bubbling or sizzling. It then softens and can be crumbled into tiny pieces or formed into shapes to obtain maximum surface area when burning. A sharp razor knife can be used to divide hard unheated hash into small slender pieces. If the material is of the right consistency, it can be ground up with a marijuana grinder. Although heating may cause more THC to be released in its active form.\n\n【8】 ## Vaporization\n- Used with hashish as with any cannabis, tobacco or other herb material, a vaporizer can extract cannabinoids at a temperature of 350°F./150°C., protecting against loss of this ingredient which occurs in burning, and eliminating carbon monoxide and other combustion toxins. Since hashish is solid, it's surface area is enlarged by the user, for a maximum cannabinoid vaporization.\n\n【9】 ## \"Knife Hits\"\n- Hash can be placed on very hot pieces of metal and the resulting vapor inhaled. \"Knife hits\" is a method that involves heating up knives on a stove, crushing a little ball of the hash between them and inhaling the released vapor through a tube or straw. Hash cones is a method where a piece of hash is attached to a pin or metal wire and then heated.\n\n【10】 ## One-hitter (semivaporizer)\n- The next lowest temperature is achieved with a narrow-diameter, screened-crater utensil-- one-hitter, minitoke, kiseru or midwakh-- where the practiced user sucks the air slowly enough to assure slow, low-temperature burning, so that the cannabinol in any part of the hashish has time to vaporize from being heated by an already burning adjacent part of the hashish (semivaporizer).  A butane lighter should be used instead of matches to permit frequent, very brief relightings, and a long tube (such as those found on hookahs) added giving the heated aerosol a longer distance to travel, i.e. more time to cool down before reaching the user's trachea.\n\n【11】 ## Dabous\n- A piece of hash may be ignited by cigarette coals or other means and placed inside a container.  The smoke that collects inside can then be inhaled. Dabous or Khabour, but most commonly  \"shi-sha\" (glass in Arabic) is a North African technique.  In Canada this technique is commonly referred to as \"Bots\" or \"BTs\" (\"Bottle-Tokes\").\n\n【12】 ## Mixtures\n- Often hash is mixed with tobacco, cannabis or another herb, and the combination rolled up into a cigarette or burned in a large pipe by users impatient to get it burning, a procedure best avoided as the high burning temperature results in major loss of THC (and the exposure to nicotine can result in tobacco addiction).  Smoked by itself, hash usually creates a stronger psychoactive effect on the user.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 01:01:36"}

An assessment by a Neuropsychologist could be useful (in making the differential diagnosis) and excluding  possible co-morbid Psychiatric or Psychological causes.\n- APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as \"hat\" with \"bat\", \"there\" with \"where\", etc. Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. Problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word. Separating speech sounds from background noise, pink sound, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar, it can be difficult to impossible to understand speech, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder. Using a telephone can be problematic, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words can be a problem for someone with Auditory processing disorder to cope with, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing (hearing).\n- Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.\n\n【5】 # Causes\n be inherited or genetic. Because there are many different possibilities, each person must be assessed individually.\n\n【6】 # Diagnosis\n be confused with Language Processing Disorder.  Unlike APD, LPD is more specifically a problem associated with the linking of words, both written and spoken, to semantics (meaning) and someone can have both APD and LPD.  Unlike those with LPD, those with APD can usually get the meaning of language from written words where those with LPD show problems with both heard and read words, demonstrating that the basic issue is not an auditory one.\n- People with APD intermittently experience an inability to process verbal information. When people with APD have a processing failure, they do not process what is being said to them. They may be able to repeat the words back word for word, but the meaning of the message is lost. Simply repeating the instruction is of no use if a person with APD is not processing. Neither will increasing the volume help.\n- People with APD have an Auditory (Verbal) Processing Disorder, and text is only verbal code, and so the Auditory Processing Disorder is extended into reading and writing as this auditory code. As a consequence, APD has been recognized as one of the major causes of dyslexia.\n many other hidden implications, which are not always apparent even to the person with the disability. For example, because people with APD are used to guessing to fill in the processing gaps, they may not even be aware that they have misunderstood something.\n\n【7】 # History\n- Some of the characteristics of APD may be observed in individuals with other types of deficits or disorders, such as acquired brain injury, attention deficits, dyslexia or learning difficulties, hearing loss, and psychologically-based behavioral problems.  APD may be related to cluttering, a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.\n\n【8】 # Symptoms\n- Persons with this condition often:\n- have trouble paying attention to and remembering in\n- have problems carrying out multi-step directions given orally; need to hear only one direction at a time\n- appear to have poor listening skills, and need people to speak slowly\n- need more time to process information.\n- It appears to others as a problem with listening. Somebody with APD may be accused of \"not listening\".\n\n【9】 # Coping Skillsand Management\n- Adults who discover disabilities such as APD late in life have provided some insight into coping skills they have found helpful. These include:\n- Ask people to speak slowly, especially on the telephone.\n- If someone is giving you several pieces of information together, repeat each one aloud as you hear it. This allows the brain the necessary time to assimilate the last message before receiving a new one.\n- Get directions and instructions in writing.\n- When given a unit of information e.g. a number, immediately form a mental picture of it. Visual messages are much easier for APD sufferers to store in memory.\n- Do not take notes yourself when information comes from others orally, as this may interfere with your processing strategies, but ask others to provide notes for you.\n- Many APDs use body language, lip reading and eye contact as a coping strategy.\n- Rewrite text using multi-coloured text options to provide visual guide to changes in meaning or for new sentences, or use a set of coloured highlighters.\n- Use closed captioning while watching television.\n- Place with teachers whose speaking style is clear and organized, who are \"good explainers,\" and who encourage questions, so that the person with APD does not have to decode complex verbiage. Rules of language activities, including writing, need to be made overt and very explicit.\n\n【10】 # Remediations and Training\n- No one program is a cure or help all for APD. There are no research supported treatments for APD available, however a variety of treatments have been offered commercially in the absence of solid empirical research support for their efficacy.\n- APD is about creating coping strategies to meet the challenges life presents and using the various strengths each of us may have.\n- Management of Auditory Processing Disorders (includes the use of many programs)\n- AIT Institute \n- Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes (particularly, the Visualizing and Verbalizing program)\n- Physical activities which require frequent crossing of the midline (e.g. occupational therapy)\n- Sound Field Amplification\n\n【11】 # APDand Dyslexia\n be an underlying cause of dyslexia. \"auditory performance in competing acoustic signals\" (including dichotic listening)).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#3#3#an acquired condition (\n多余括号\n多余标点#11#11# (including dichotic listening))多余括号", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 02:09:56"}

In Study 4, 13% of subjects in the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/REBETOL arm, 10% in the PegIntron 1 mcg/REBETOL arm and 13% in the Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus arm discontinued due to adverse events.\n- In Study 2, dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 42% of subjects receiving PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/REBETOL and in 34% of those receiving INTRON A/REBETOL. The majority of subjects (57%) weighing 60 kg or less receiving PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/REBETOL required dose reduction. Reduction of interferon was dose-related (PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg greater than PegIntron 0.5 mcg/kg or INTRON A), 40%, 27%, 28%, respectively. Dose reduction for REBETOL was similar across all three groups, 33 to 35%. The most common reasons for dose modifications were neutropenia (18%), or anemia (9%) . Other common reasons included depression, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. In Study 3, dose modifications due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently with weight-based dosing (WBD) compared to flat dosing (29% and 23%, respectively). In Study 4, 16% of subjects had a dose reduction of PegIntron to 1 mcg/kg in combination with REBETOL, with an additional 4% requiring the second dose reduction of PegIntron to 0.5 mcg/kg due to adverse events compared to 15% of subjects in the Pegasys/Copegus arm, who required a dose reduction to 135 mcg/week with Pegasys, with an additional 7% in the Pegasys/Copegus arm requiring second dose reduction to 90 mcg/week with Pegasys.\n- In the PegIntron/REBETOL combination trials the most common adverse reactions were psychiatric, which occurred among 77% of subjects in Study 2 and 68% to 69% of subjects in Study 3. These psychiatric adverse reactions included most commonly depression, irritability, and insomnia, each reported by approximately 30% to 40% of subjects in all treatment groups. Suicidal behavior (ideation, attempts, and suicides) occurred in 2% of all subjects during treatment or during follow-up after treatment cessation . In Study 4, psychiatric adverse reactions occurred in 58% of subjects in the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/REBETOL arm, 55% of subjects in the PegIntron 1 mcg/REBETOL arm, and 57% of subjects in the Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus arm.\n- PegIntron induced fatigue or headache in approximately two-thirds of subjects, with fever or rigors in approximately half of the subjects. The severity of some of these systemic symptoms (e.g., fever and headache) tended to decrease as treatment continued. In Studies 1 and 2, application site inflammation and reaction (e.g., bruise, itchiness, and irritation) occurred at approximately twice the incidence with PegIntron therapies (in up to 75% of subjects) compared with INTRON A. However, injection site pain was infrequent (2 to 3%) in all groups. In Study 3, there was a 23% to 24% incidence overall for injection site reactions or inflammation.\n- Subjects receiving REBETOL/PegIntron as re-treatment after failing a previous interferon combination regimen reported adverse reactions similar to those previously associated with this regimen during clinical trials of treatment-naïve subjects.\n\n【5】 ## Pediatric Subjects\n- In general, the adverse-reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. In the pediatric trial, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80%), headache (62%), neutropenia (33%), fatigue (30%), anorexia (29%), injection-site erythema (29%) and vomiting (27%). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the trial were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7% (8/ of all subjects and included injection site pain (1%), pain in extremity (1%), headache (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pyrexia (4%). Important adverse reactions that occurred in this subject population were nervousness (7%; 7/, aggression (3%; 3/, anger (2%; 2/, and depression (1%; 1/. Five subjects received levothyroxine treatment, three with clinical hypothyroidism and two with asymptomatic TSH elevations. Weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron plus REBETOL lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than 3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects while on treatment.\n- Dose modifications of PegIntron and/or ribavirin were required in 25% of subjects due to treatment-related adverse reactions, most commonly for anemia, neutropenia and weight loss. Two subjects (2%; 2/ discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction.\n- Adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than or equal to 10% incidence in the pediatric trial subjects are provided in \n- Ninety-four of 107 subjects enrolled in a 5 year long-term follow-up trial. The long-term effects on growth were less in those subjects treated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. Twenty-four percent of subjects (11/ treated for 24 weeks and 40% of subjects (19/ treated for 48 weeks had a >15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the end of 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of subjects (5/ treated for 24 weeks and 13% of subjects (6/ treated for 48 weeks were observed to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of >30 height-for-age percentiles to the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up. While observed across all age groups, the highest risk for reduced height at the end of long-term follow-up appeared to correlate with initiation of combination therapy during the years of expected peak growth velocity.\n\n【6】 ## Laboratory Values\n\n【7】 # Adultand Pediatric Subjects\n- The adverse reaction profile in Study 3, which compared PegIntron/weight-based REBETOL combination to a PegIntron/flat dose REBETOL regimen, revealed an increased rate of anemia with weight-based dosing (29% vs. 19% for weight-based vs. flat dose regimens, respectively). However, the majority of cases of anemia were mild and responded to dose reductions.\n- Changes in selected laboratory values during treatment in combination with REBETOL treatment are described below. Decreases in hemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy . Changes in selected laboratory values during therapy are described in  Most of the changes in laboratory values in the PegIntron/REBETOL trial with pediatrics were mild or moderate.\n- Hemoglobin. Hemoglobin levels decreased to less than 11 g/dL in about 30% of subjects in Study 2. In Study 3, 47% of subjects receiving WBD REBETOL and 33% on flat-dose REBETOL had decreases in hemoglobin levels less than 11 g/dl. Reductions in hemoglobin to less than 9 g/dL occurred more frequently in subjects receiving WBD compared to flat dosing (4% and 2%, respectively). In Study 2, dose modification was required in 9% and 13% of subjects in the PegIntron/REBETOL and INTRON A/REBETOL groups. In Study 4, subjects receiving PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/REBETOL had decreases in hemoglobin levels to between 8.5 to less than 10 g/dL (28%) and to less than 8.5 g/dL (3%), whereas in patients receiving Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus these decreases occurred in 26% and 4% of subjects respectively. Hemoglobin levels became sby treatment Weeks 4-6 on average. The typical pattern observed was a decrease in hemoglobin levels by treatment Week 4 followed by stabilization and a plateau, which was maintained to the end of treatment. In the PegIntron monotherapy trial, hemoglobin decreases were generally mild and dose modifications were rarely necessary .\n- Neutrophils. Decreases in neutrophil counts were observed in a majority of adult subjects treated with combination therapy with REBETOL in Study 2 (85%) and INTRON A/REBETOL (60%). Severe potentially life-threatening neutropenia (less than 0.5 × 109/L) occurred in 2% of subjects treated with INTRON A/REBETOL and in approximately 4% of subjects treated with PegIntron/REBETOL in Study 2. Eighteen percent of subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL in Study 2 required modification of interferon dosage. Few subjects (less than 1%) required permanent discontinuation of treatment. Neutrophil counts generally returned to pre-treatment levels 4 weeks after cessation of therapy .\n- Platelets. Platelet counts decreased to less than 100,000/mm3 in approximately 20% of subjects treated with PegIntron alone or with REBETOL and in 6% of adult subjects treated with INTRON A/REBETOL. Severe decreases in platelet counts (less than 50,000/mm occur in less than 4% of adult subjects. Patients may require discontinuation or dose modification as a result of platelet decreases . In Study 2, 1% or 3% of subjects required dose modification of INTRON A or PegIntron, respectively. Platelet counts generally returned to pretreatment levels 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy.\n- Thyroid Function. Development of TSH abnormalities, with or without clinical manifestations, is associated with interferon therapies. In Study 2, clinically apparent thyroid disorders occurred among subjects treated with either INTRON A or PegIntron (with or without REBETOL) at a similar incidence (5% for hypothyroidism and 3% for hyperthyroidism). Subjects developed new onset TSH abnormalities while on treatment and during the follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period 7% of subjects still had abnormal TSH values.\n- Bilirubin and uric acid. In Study 2, 10 to 14% of subjects developed hyperbilirubinemia and 33 to 38% developed hyperuricemia in association with hemolysis. Six subjects developed mild to moderate gout.\n\n【8】 # Clinical Trials Experience– REBETOL/INTRON A Combination Therapy\n\n【9】 ### Adult Subjects\n- In clinical trials, 19% and 6% of previously untreated and relapse subjects, respectively, discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions in the combination arms compared to 13% and 3% in the interferon arms. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred in the US trials with greater than or equal to 5% incidence are provided by treatment group . In general, the selected treatment-related adverse reactions were reported with lower incidence in the international trials as compared to the US trials, with the exception of asthenia, influenza-like symptoms, nervousness, and pruritus.\n\n【10】 ### Pediatric Subjects\n- In clinical trials of 118 pediatric subjects 3 to 16 years of age, 6% discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Dose modifications were required in 30% of subjects, most commonly for anemia and neutropenia. In general, the adverse-reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. Injection site disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in pediatric subjects compared to adult subjects. Conversely, pediatric subjects experienced less fatigue, dyspepsia, arthralgia, insomnia, irritability, impaired concentration, dyspnea, and pruritus compared to adult subjects. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred with greater than or equal to 5% incidence among all pediatric subjects who received the recommended dose of REBETOL/INTRON A combination therapy are provided in \n- During a 48-week course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth (mean percentile assignment decrease of 7%) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile assignment decrease of 9%). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24-week post-treatment period. Long-term data in a limited number of patients, however, suggests that combination therapy may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced final adult height in some patients .\n\n【11】 ### Laboratory Values\n- Changes in selected hematologic values (hemoglobin, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) during therapy are described below .\n- Hemoglobin. Hemoglobin decreases among subjects receiving REBETOL therapy began at Week 1, with stabilization by Week 4. In previously untreated subjects treated for 48 weeks, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3.1 g/dL in the US trial and 2.9 g/dL in the international trial. In relapse subjects, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2.8 g/dL in the US trial and 2.6 g/dL in the international trial. Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most subjects.\n- Bilirubin and Uric Acid. Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid, associated with hemolysis, were noted in clinical trials. Most were moderate biochemical changes and were reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. This observation occurred most frequently in subjects with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experiences\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during post approval use of REBETOL in combination with INTRON A or PegIntron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Blood and Lymphatic System disorders\n- Pure red cell aplasia, aplastic anemia\n- Ear and Labyrinth disorders\n- Hearing disorder, vertigo\n- Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders\n- Pulmonary hypertension\n- Eye disorders\n- Serous retinal detachment\n- Endocrine disorders\n- Diabetes", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#4#4#Therapy (Study in\nsummarizes是一句话", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 18:40:11"}

The spermatic cord is made up of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the duct that carries sperm from the body (vas deferens). If the valves that regulate bloodflow from these veins become defective, blood does not circulate out of the testicles efficiently, which causes swelling in the veins above and behind the testicles.\n- A varicocele can develop in one testicle or both, but in about 85% of cases it develops in the left testicle. The left spermatic vein drains into the renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta; these two arteries can compress the renal vein and thus impede bloodflow from the spermatic vein. The right spermatic vein drains into the vein that returns blood to the heart (vena cava) and develops varicocele less often. A one-sided (unilateral) varicocele can affect either testicle.\n impede production of new, healthy sperm.\n\n【2】 # Incidence and Prevalence\n- Incidence of varicocele is 10-20% and is highest in men between the ages of 15 and 25. The sudden appearance of varicocele in an older man may indicate a renal tumor blocking the spermatic vein.\n- Approximately 40% of infertile men have a varicocele and among men with secondary infertility—those who have fathered a child but are no longer able to do so—prevalence may be as high as 80%.\n\n【3】 # Causes\n- A varicocele develops when the valve that regulates bloodflow from the vein into the main circulatory system becomes damaged or defective. Inefficient blood flow causes enlargement (dilation) of the vein.\n\n【4】 # Signs and Symptoms\n- Most men who have a varicocele have no symptoms. Asymptomatic (i.e., symptom-free) cases are often diagnosed during a routine physical examination. Signs and symptoms may include the following:\n- Testicular pain\n- Feeling of heaviness in the testicle(s)\n- Infertility\n- Shrinkage (atrophy) of the testicle(s)\n- Visible or palpable (able to be felt) enlarged vein\n- Recurrent or constant discomfort or pain in the genital region should be reported to a urologist or primary care physician to determine the cause.\n\n【5】 # Diagnosis\n- Large varicoceles may be seen with the naked eye. Medium-sized varicoceles may be detected during physical examination by feeling (palpating) the area. A patient suspected of having a varicocele should be examined while standing up, as a varicocele is more prominent in this position than in the supine (i.e., lying down, face up) position. Small varicoceles may be discovered by a physician using one of the following procedures.\n\n【6】 # Treatment\n- If the patient is asymptomatic or the symptoms are mild and infertility is not an issue, the condition can be managed by wearing an athletic supporter or snug-fitting underwear to provide the scrotum with support.\n\n【7】 # Surgery\n- If the varicocele causes pain or atrophy, if it damages the testicle(s), or if the condition is causing infertility, surgery may be recommended. Most varicoceles can be corrected through a surgical procedure called varicocelectomy (i.e., surgically \"tying off\" the affected spermatic veins). The following methods are used.\n- Surgical ligation usually requires general or reginal anesthesia. In this procedure, a 2- to 3-inch incision is made in the groin or lower abdomen, the affected veins are located visually, and the surgeon cuts the veins and ties them off above the varicocele to reroute the blood through unaffected veins. A incision in the groin (transinguinal) is commonly used and a lower abdomen (retroperitoneal) incision is used in patients with scar tissue from a prior varicocelectomy or hernia repair. Surgery can be performed on an in- or outpatient basis. The patient typically can resume light activity within a week and strenuous activity in about 6 weeks.\n- Embolization is a nonsurgical procedure that takes about an hour and a half. A small tube (catheter) is inserted into a small incision in the groin to block the flow of blood to the varicocele. Venography is used to highlight the varicocele on x-ray and to visually guide the catheter. The catheter is then used to push tiny coils into place to block the blood flow to the dilated vein. This eases the pressure, reduces enlargement, and restores normal circulation. Light sedation, sometimes called \"twilight anesthesia,\" is used during the procedure; the patient does not lose consciousness. Stitches are not needed. Normal activity is usually resumed within 2 days.\n- Laparoscopy is a technique in which the surgeon inserts a tiny camera attached to a long cylindrical tube into the abdominal cavity through a small incision. Using the camera to locate the varicocele, the surgeon then inserts other instruments through the same incision to isolate and tie off the dilated veins. This technique requires a smaller incision than surgical ligation and is sometimes regarded as less invasive. The laparoscope, however, can sometimes damage abdominal organs, which is not a risk factor in open surgery. The procedure takes about 2 hours and recovery about 2 days.\n\n【8】 # Prognosis\n- Between 5% and 20% of patients experience a recurrence. In such cases, the procedure usually is repeated. Another 2% to 5% develop a condition called hydrocele, a fluid-filled cyst that forms around the testicle. Minor surgery is used to correct this problem.\n- About 50% of men who undergo varicocelectomy to correct infertility father children within the first year. It takes about 90 days for a sufficient quantity of new sperm to be produced to permit fertilization. Semen analysis usually is done at 3- and 6-month intervals after the operation. .\n- If the patient is being examined for suspected infertility, the physician usually performs a comparative analysis of semen samples. Infertility caused by a varicocele typically produces a consistent pattern of incompletely developed, damaged, dead, or dying sperm.\n\n【9】 # Naturopathic Treatment\n- A low fiber, highly refined diet—one that relies heavily on white flour products, sugar, and processed foods rather than fresh veges, whole grains, and fruits—is thought to be a contributing factor to varicocele formation. A lack of dietary fiber may slow down the bowels and contribute to constipation by hardening and drying the stool. Constipation stresses the pelvic floor by putting pressure on the veins when the bowels move. This repeated pressure strains the vessel walls and may damage vessel tissue.\n- Another contributing factor to varicocele formation is the lack of flavinoid-rich foods. Flavonoids, which are found in abundance in fresh veges and fruits, have been shown to contribute to the structural integrity of blood vessels.\n\n【10】 # Diet Recommendations\n\n【11】 # Supplemental Nutrition\n\n【12】 # Herbal Therapeutics\n- Herbal remedies usually do not have side effects associated with regular use at the suggested doses. Rarely, an herb at the prescribed dose causes stomach upset or headache. This may reflect the purity of the preparation or added ingredients such as synthetic binders or fillers. For this reason it is recommended that you use only high quality, standardized extract formulas.\n- If possible, consult with a natural health practitioner such as a holistic medical doctor or licensed naturopathic physician before starting any alternative treatment plan. As with all medications, more is not better and overdosing can lead to serious illness and, in rare cases, death.\n- The following herbs may tone, strengthen, and improve the function of veins:\n\n【13】 # Physical Medicine\n- Kegel exercises to improve blood flow and muscle tone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type2": "多余标点#8#8#intervals after the operation. .", "type4": "语义不完整#12#12#The following herbs may tone, strengthen, and improve the function of veins:没表述完整"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-09 22:42:56"}

This planning should start when young people are aged 14 and follow the NICE guideline on transition from children's to adults' services.\n- The designated leadership team, together with health and social care providers, should ensure that care pathways:\n- provide access to all NICE-recommended interventions for mental health problems\n- clearly state the responsibilities of specialist learning disabilities and specialist mental health services to ensure people's needs are met.\n- For people with learning disabilities who need acute inpatient treatment for a serious mental illness, provide treatment:\n- within a locally available service where possible and\n- with staff who are skilled and knowledgeable in the care and treatment of mental health problems in people with learning disabilities.\n- Staff working with people with learning disabilities and mental health problems should ensure they are fully informed about:\n- the nature and degree of the learning disabilities\n- the nature and severity of the mental health problem, and any physical health problems (including sensory impairments).\n- All people with learning disabilities and a serious mental illness should have a key worker who:\n- coordinates all aspects of care, including safeguarding concerns and risk management\n- helps services communicate with the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) clearly and promptly, in a format and language suited to the person's needs and preferences\n- monitors the implementation of the care plan and its outcomes.\n- Health, social care and education services should train all staff who may come into contact with people with learning disabilities to be aware:\n- that people with learning disabilities are at increased risk of mental health problems\n- that mental health problems may develop and present in different ways from people without learning disabilities, and the usual signs or symptoms may not be observable or reported\n- that people with learning disabilities can develop mental health problems for the same reasons as people without learning disabilities (for example, because of financial worries, bereavement or relationship difficulties)\n- that mental health problems are commonly overlooked in people with learning disabilities\n- where to refer people with learning disabilities and suspected mental health problems.\n- Health and social care services should ensure that staff who deliver interventions for people with learning disabilities and mental health problems are competent, and that they:\n- receive regular high-quality supervision\n- deliver interventions based on relevant manuals, if available\n- evaluate adherence to interventions\n- take part in the monitoring of their practice (for example, by using video and audio recording, external audit and scrutiny).\n- Health and social care staff who deliver interventions for people with learning disabilities and mental health problems should consider using routine sessional outcome measures, including  service-user-reported experience measures.\n\n【8】 # Involving people with learning disabilities, and their family members, carers or care workers, in mental health assessment and treatment\n\n【9】 ## Communication\n- Take into account the person's communication needs and level of understanding throughout assessments, treatment and care for a mental health problem, and:\n- speak to the person directly rather than talking about or over them\n- use clear, straightforward and unambiguous language\n- assess whether communication aids, an advocate or someone familiar with the person's communication methods are needed\n- make adjustments to accommodate sensory impairments (including sight and hearing impairments)\n- explain the content and purpose of every meeting or session\n- use concrete examples, visual imagery, practical demonstrations and role play to explain concepts\n- communicate at a pace that is comforfor the person, and arrange longer or additional meetings or treatment sessions if needed\n- use different methods and formats for communication (written, signing, visual, verbal, or a combination of these), depending on the person's preferences \n- regularly check the person's understanding\n- summarise and explain the conclusions of every meeting or session\n- check that the person has communicated what they wanted.\n\n【10】 ## Consent, capacity and decision-making\n- Assess the person's capacity to make decisions throughout assessment, care and treatment for the mental health problem on a decision-by-decision basis, in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act and supporting codes of practice . Help people make decisions by ensuring that their communication needs are met  and (if appropriate) involving a family member, carer, care worker or other individual familiar with the person's communication abilities.\n- Staff delivering care to people with learning disabilities and mental health problems should:\n- discuss the assessment process and treatment options with the person and provide information in a format and language suited to their needs, including:\n- potential benefits\n- potential side effects or disadvantages\n- the purpose of treatment\n- utcome measures\n- ensure that the person understands the purpose, plan and content of any meeting or intervention before it starts, and regularly throughout\n- address any queries or concerns that the person may have at any stage\n- allow enough time for the person to make an informed choice if they have decision-making capacity, and if they do not then provide enough time for their family members, carers or care workers to contribute fully.\n\n【11】 ## Involving family members, carers and care workers\n- Encourage and support family members, carers and care workers (as appropriate) to be actively involved throughout the assessment, care and treatment of the person's mental health problem, apart from in exceptional circumstances when an adult or young person with decision-making capacity has said that they do not want them involved.\n- Give family members, carers and care workers (as appropriate) in\n\n【12】 # Support and interventions for family members and carers\n- Advise family members and carers about their right to carer assessment, and assessment for respite care and other support .\n- When providing support to family members (including siblings) and carers:\n- recognise the potential impact of living with or caring for a person with learning disabilities and a mental health problem\n- explain how to access:\n- family advocacy\n- family support and information groups\n- disability-specific support groups for family members or carers\n- provide skills training and emotional support, or information about how to access these, to help them take part in and support interventions for the person with learning disabilities and a mental health problem.\n has an identified mental health problem, offer:\n- interventions in line with the NICE guidelines on specific mental health problems or\n- referral to a mental health professional who can provide interventions in line with NICE guidelines.\n\n【13】 # Social and physical environment interventions\n- Health, social care and education services should consider the impact of the social and physical environment on the mental health of children and young people with learning disabilities when developing care plans, and:\n- provide positive educational environments that are appropriate to their needs\n- when care placements (such as birth family to foster care, foster care to adoptive placement, home to residential school/college) are required, minimise the risk of placement breakdown by taking particular care to fit these to the needs of the person.\n- give special consideration and support to looked-after children and young people with learning disabilities and their foster parents or care workers, to reduce the child or young person's very high risk of developing mental health problems, and the risk of changes in their home and carers .\n- Health, social care and education services should consider the impact of the social and physical environment on the mental health of adults with learning disabilities when developing care plans,and:\n- support people to live where and with whom they want\n- encourage family involvement in the person's life, if appropriate\n- support people to get involved in activities that are interesting and meaningful to them\n- plan for and help people with any significant changes to their living arrangements.\n\n【14】 # Annual health check\n- The following recommendations on annual health checks for people with learning disabilities build on recommendation 1.2.1 in the NICE guideline on challenging behaviour and learning disabilities, which relates to the provision of annual physical checks by GPs to all people with learning disabilities.\n- GPs should offer an annual health check using NHS England's learning disability annual health check electronic clinical template to all adults with learning disabilities, and all children and young people with learning disabilities who are not having annual health checks with a paediatrician.\n- Involve a family member, carer or care worker (as appropriate), or a healthcare professional or social care practitioner who knows the person well, in the annual health check. Take into account that more time may be needed to complete health checks with people with learning disabilities.\n- Include the following in annual health checks:\n- a mental health review, including any known or suspected mental health problems and how they may be linked to any physical health problems\n- a physical health review, including assessment for the conditions and impairments which are common in people with learning disabilities\n- a review of all current interventions, including medication and related side effects, adverse events, interactions and adherence\n- an agreed and shared care plan for managing any physical health problems (including pain).\n- During annual health checks with adults with Down's syndrome, ask them and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) about any changes that might suggest the need for an assessment of dementia, such as:\n- any change in the person's behaviour\n- any loss of skills (including self-care)\n- a need for more prompting in the past few months.\n\n【15】 # Identification and referral\n- Staff and others caring for people with learning disabilities should consider a mental health problem if a person with learning disabilities shows any changes in behaviour, for example:\n- loss of skills or needing more prompting to use skills\n- social withdrawal\n- irritability\n- avoidance\n- agitation\n- loss of interest in activities they usually enjoy.\n- Staff should consider using identification questions (adjusted as needed) as recommended in the NICE guidelines on specific mental health problems to identify common mental health problems in people with learning disabilities.\n- Paediatricians should explain to parents of children identified with learning disabilities that mental health problems are common in people with learning disabilities, and may present in different ways.\n- If a mental health problem is suspected in a person with learning disabilities, staff should conduct a triage assessment to establish an initial formulation of the problem. This should include:\n- a description of the problem, including its nature, severity and duration\n- an action plan including possible referral for further assessment and interventions.\n- Refer people with learning disabilities who have a suspected serious mental illness or suspected dementia to a psychiatrist with expertise in assessing and treating mental health problems in people with learning disabilities.\n\n【16】 # Assessment\n\n【17】 ## Conducting a mental health assessment\n- A professional with expertise in mental health problems in people with learning disabilities should coordinate the mental health assessment, and conduct it with:\n- the person with the mental health problem, in a place familiar to them if possible, and help them to prepare for it if needed\n- the family members, carers, care workers and others that the person wants involved in their assessment\n- ther professionals (if needed) who are competent in using a range of assessment tools and methods with people with learning disabilities and mental health problems.\n- Speak to the person on their own to find out if they have any concerns (including safeguarding concerns) that they don't want to talk about in front of their family members, carers or care workers.\n- Before mental health assessments:\n- agree a clear objective, and explain it to the person, their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate), and all professionals involved\n- explain the nature and duration of the assessment to everyone involved\n- explain the need to ask certain sensitive questions\n- address any queries or concerns that the person may have about the assessment process.\n- When conducting mental health assessments, be aware:\n- that an underlying physical health condition may be causing the problem\n- that a physical health condition, sensory or cognitive impairment may mask an underlying mental health problem\n- that mental health problems can present differently in people with more severe learning disabilities.\n- When conducting mental health assessments, take into account the person's:\n- level of distress\n- understanding of the problem\n- living arrangements and settings where they receive care\n- strengths and needs.\n- During mental health assessments:\n- establish specific areas of need to focus on\n- assess all potential psychopathology, and not just the symptoms and signs that the person and their family members, carers or care workers first report\n- describe the nature, duration and severity of the presenting mental health problem\n- take into account the person's cultural, ethnic and religious background\n- review psychiatric and medical history, past treatments and response\n- review physical health problems and any current medication, and  other specialists for review if needed\n- review the nature and degree of the learning disabilities, and if relevant the person's developmental history\n- assess for problems that may be associated with particular behavioural phenotypes (for example, anxiety in people with autism and psychosis in people with Prader–Willi syndrome), so that they can be treated\n- assess the person's family and social circumstances and environment, and recent life events\n- assess the level of drug or alcohol use as a potential problem in itself and as a factor contributing to other mental health problems\n- establish or review a diagnosis using:\n- a classification system such as DSM-5 or ICD-10, or those adapted for learning disabilities (for example the Diagnostic Manual – Intellectual Disability  or Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for Use with Adults with Learning Disabilities/Mental Retardation ) or\n- problem specification\n- assess whether a risk assessment is needed .\n- Assess recent changes in behaviour using in\n- Use the results of the mental health assessment to develop a written statement (formulation) of the mental health problem, which should form the basis of the care plan  and cover:\n- an understanding of the nature of the problem and its development\n- precipitating and maintaining factors\n- any protective factors\n- the potential benefits, side effects and harms of any interventions\n- the potential difficulties with delivering interventions\n- the adjustments needed to deliver interventions\n- the impact of the mental health problem and associated risk factors on providing care and treatment.\n- Provide the person, their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate), and all relevant professionals with a summary of the assessment:\n- in an agreed format and language\n- that sets out the implications for care and treatment.\n- Give the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) another chance to discuss the assessment after it has finished, for example at a follow-up appointment.\n\n【18】 ## Further assessment\n- Consider conducting a further assessment that covers any areas not explored by the initial assessment, if:\n- new information emerges about the person's mental health problem or\n- there are significant differences between the views of the person and the views of their family members, carers, care workers or staff about the problems that the assessment has focused on.\n\n【19】 ## Assessment tools\n- During any mental health assessment:\n- consider using tools that have been developed or adapted for people with learning disabilities and\n- take cost into account if more than one suitool is available.\n- If using tools that have not been developed or adapted for people with learning disabilities, take this into account when interpreting the results.\n- When conducting an assessment with a child or young person with learning disabilities, consider using tools such as the Developmental Behavior Checklist – parent version (DBC-P) or the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).\n- When assessing depressive symptoms in an adult with learning disabilities, consider using a formal measure of depression to monitor change over time, such as the Glasgow Depression Scale (the self-report for people with milder learning disabilities or the carer supplement for people with any degree of learning disabilities).\n- Consider supplementing an assessment of dementia with an adult with learning disabilities with:\n- measures of symptoms, such as the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities (DLD), the Down Syndrome Dementia Scale (DSDS) or the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID)\n- measures of cognitive function to monitor changes over time, such as the Test for Severe Impairment (TSI)\n- measures of adaptive function to monitor changes over time.\n- Complete a baseline assessment of adaptive behaviour with all adults with Down's syndrome.\n\n【20】 ## Risk assessment\n- When conducting risk assessments with people with learning disabilities and mental health problems, assess:\n- risk to self\n- risk to others (including sexual offending)\n- risk of self-neglect\n- vulnerability to exploitation\n- likelihood and severity of any particular risk\n- potential triggers, causal or maintaining factors\n- whether safeguarding protocols should be implemented.\n- If indicated by the risk assessment, develop a risk management plan with the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate).\n- Risk management plans should:\n- set out individual, social or environmental interventions to reduce risk\n- be communicated to family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) and all relevant staff and agencies.\n- Risk assessments and resulting risk management plans should be reviewed regularly and adjusted if risk levels change.\n\n【21】 ## Mental health assessment during a crisis\n- Conduct an initial assessment for people who are experiencing a mental health crisis, which should:\n- include an assessment of the person's mental health\n- include a risk assessment \n- include identification of interventions to:\n- help address the problem that caused the crisis\n- minimise any associated risks\n- bring stability to the individual and their immediate environment\n- produce a crisis plan that sets out (using the least restrictive options possible) how to reduce the likelihood of further crises, and what to do if the person has another crisis.\n\n【22】 ## The mental health care plan\n- Develop a mental health care plan with each person with learning disabilities and a mental health problem and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate), and integrate it into their other care plans.\n- Base mental health care plans on the written statement (formulation) and include in them:\n- goals agreed with the person and the steps to achieve them\n- treatment decisions\n- agreed outcome measures that are realistic and meaningful to the person, to monitor progress\n- early warning signs of relapse or exacerbation of symptoms, if known\n- risk and crisis plans, if needed \n- steps to minimise future problems.\n- Ensure that the mental health care plan sets out the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in delivering it, and that:\n- the person can easily access all interventions and services in the plan\n- it is communicated to everyone involved, including the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate)\n- there is an agreement on when the plan will be reviewed.\n\n【23】 # Psychological interventions\n\n【24】 ## Delivering psychological interventions for mental health problems in people with learning disabilities\n- For psychological interventions for mental health problems in people with learning disabilities,  the NICE guidelines on specific mental health problems and take into account:\n- the principles for delivering psychological interventions  and\n- the specific interventions recommended in this guideline .\n- Use the mental health assessment to inform the psychological intervention and any adaptations to it, and:\n- tailor it to their preferences, level of understanding, and strengths and needs\n- take into account any physical, neurological, cognitive or sensory impairments and communication needs\n- take into account the person's need for privacy (particularly when offering interventions on an outreach basis)\n- agree how it will be delivered (for example, face-to-face or remotely by phone or computer), taking into account the person's communication needs and how suiremote working is for them.\n- If possible, collaborate with the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) to:\n- develop and agree the intervention goals\n- develop an understanding of how the person expresses or describes emotions or distressing experiences\n- agree the structure, frequency, duration and content of the intervention, including its timing, mode of delivery and pace\n- agree the level of flexibility needed to effectively deliver the intervention\n- agree how progress will be measured and how data will be collected (for example, visual representations of distress or wellbeing).\n- Be aware that people with learning disabilities might need more structured support to practise and apply new skills to everyday life between sessions. In discussion with the person, consider:\n- providing additional support during meetings and in the planning of activities between meetings\n- asking a family member, carer or care worker to provide support and assistance (such as reminders) to practise new skills between meetings.\n\n【25】 ## Specific psychological interventions\n- Consider cognitive behavioural therapy, adapted for people with learning disabilities , to treat depression or subthreshold depressive symptoms in people with milder learning disabilities.\n- Consider relaxation therapy to treat anxiety symptoms in people with learning disabilities.\n- Consider using graded exposure techniques to treat anxiety symptoms or phobias in people with learning disabilities.\n- Consider parent training programmes specifically designed for parents or carers of children with learning disabilities to help prevent or treat mental health problems in the child, and to support carer wellbeing.\n- Parent training programmes should:\n- be delivered in groups of parents or carers\n- be accessible (for example, take place outside normal working hours or in community settings with childcare facilities)\n- focus on developing communication and social functioning skills\n- typically consist of 8 to 12 sessions lasting 90 minutes\n- follow the relevant treatment manual\n- use all of the necessary materials to ensure consistent implementation of the programme\n- seek parent feedback.\n\n【26】 # Pharmacological interventions\n- For pharmacological interventions for mental health problems in people with learning disabilities,  the NICE guidelines on specific mental health problems and take into account the principles for delivering pharmacological interventions .\n- For guidance on adherence and the safe and effective use of medicines, see the NICE guidelines on medicines adherence and medicines optimisation.\n- Only specialists with expertise in treating mental health problems in people with learning disabilities should start medication to treat a mental health problem in:\n- adults with more severe learning disabilities (unless there are locally agreed protocols for shared care)\n- children and young people with any learning disabilities.\n- Before starting medication for a mental health problem in children, young people or adults with learning disabilities:\n- take account of:\n- potential medication interactions\n- the potential impact of medication on other health conditions\n- the potential impact of other health conditions on the medication\n- when necessary consult with specialists (for example, neurologists providing epilepsy care when prescribing antipsychotic medication that may lower the seizure threshold), to minimise possible interactions\n- assess the risk of non-adherence to the medication regimen or any necessary monitoring tests (for example, blood tests), and the implications for treatment\n- establish a review schedule to reduce polypharmacy\n- provide support to improve adherence \n- assess whether support from community and learning disabilities nurses is needed for physical investigations (such as blood tests)\n- agree monitoring responsibilities, including who will carry out blood tests and other investigations, between primary and secondary care.\n- Monitor and review the benefits and possible harms or side effects, using agreed outcome measures and taking into account communication needs. If stated in the relevant NICE guideline, use the timescales given for the specific disorder to inform the review, and adjust it to the person's needs.\n- When deciding the initial dose and subsequent increases, aim for the lowest effective dose. Take account of both potential side effects and difficulties the person may have in reporting them, and the need to avoid sub-therapeutic doses that may not treat the mental health problem effectively.\n- Prescribers should record:\n- a summary of what information was provided about the medication prescribed, including side effects, to the person and their family members, carers or care workers (as appropriate) and any discussions about this\n- when the medication will be reviewed\n- plans for reducing or discontinuing the medication, if appropriate\n- full details of all medication the person is taking, including the doses, frequency and purpose.\n- For people with learning disabilities who are taking antipsychotic drugs and not experiencing psychotic symptoms:\n- consider reducing or discontinuing long-term prescriptions of antipsychotic drugs,\n- review the person's condition after reducing or discontinuing a prescription\n- consider referral to a psychiatrist experienced in working with people with learning disabilities and mental health problems\n- annually document the reasons for continuing the prescription if it is not reduced or discontinued.\n- When switching medication, pay particular attention to discontinuation or interaction effects that may occur during titration. Only change one drug at a time, to make it easier to identify these effects.\n\n【27】 # Occupational interventions\n- In keeping with the preferences of the person with learning disabilities and mental health problems, all staff should support them to:\n- engage in community activities, such as going to a library or sports centre\n- access local community resources such as libraries, cinemas, cafes and leisure centres\n- take part in leisure activities, such as hobbies, which are meaningful to the person.Reasonable adjustments may be needed to do this (in line with the Equality Act , such as a buddy system, transport, or advising local facilities on accessibility.\n- Actively encourage adults with learning disabilities (with or without a mental health problem) to find and participate in paid or voluntary work that is meaningful to them, if they are able.\n- Consider providing practical support to adults with learning disabilities (with or without a mental health problem) to find paid or voluntary work, including:\n- preparing a CV\n- identifying personal strengths and interests\n- completing application forms\n- preparing for interviews\n- accompanying the person to interviews\n- completing any pre-employment checks.\n- Health and social care services should take account of an adult or young person's sensory, physical, cognitive and communication needs and the severity of their mental health problem (if any), and consider:\n- helping them to identify and overcome any possible challenges during employment\n- appointing supported employment workers to provide ongoing support to adults with learning disabilities and their employers\n- providing information and guidance to potential employers about the benefits of recruiting people with learning disabilities\n- assisting employers in making reasonable adjustments to help them to work (in line with the Equality Act).\n\n【28】 # Terms used in this guideline\n\n【29】 ## Carer\n- A person who provides unpaid support to someone who is ill, having trouble coping or has disabilities.\n\n【30】 ## Care pathways\n- Defined in this guideline as the ways different services interact with each other, and how people access and move between them.\n\n【31】 ## Care worker\n- A person who provides paid support to someone who is ill, having trouble coping or has disabilities, in a variety of settings (including residential homes, supported living settings and day services).\n\n【32】 ## Children\n- Aged 0 to12 years.\n\n【33】 ## Key worker\n known as a care or case coordinator) is a central point of contact for the person with a mental health problem, family members, carers and the services involved in their care. They are responsible for helping the person and family members or carers to access services and for coordinating the involvement of different services. They ensure clear communication between all people and services and have an overall view of the person's needs and the requirements of their care plan.\n\n【34】 ## Learning disabilities\n- Learning disabilities are commonly divided into 'mild', 'moderate', 'severe' and 'profound', but these categories are based on IQ and most UK health and social care services do not measure this. Therefore, this guideline uses the terms 'milder learning disabilities' (approximating to mild and moderate learning disabilities that are often defined as an IQ of 35 to 69 and impairment of adaptive functioning with onset in childhood) and 'more severe learning disabilities' (approximating to severe and profound learning disabilities that are often defined as an IQ of 34 or below with impairment of adaptive functioning with onset in childhood).\n- All people with learning disabilities:\n- need additional support at school\n- need support in some areas of adult life, such as budgeting, planning, time management, and understanding complex information\n- need more time to learn new skills than people who don't have learning disabilities.\n- People with milder learning disabilities:\n- may be able to live independently and care for themselves, managing everyday tasks and working in paid employment\n- can often communicate their needs and wishes\n- may have some language skills\n- may have needs that are not clear to people who do not know them well.\n- People with more severe learning disabilities are more likely to:\n- need support with daily activities such as dressing, washing, food preparation, and keeping themselves safe\n- have limited or no verbal communication skills or understanding of others\n- need support with mobility\n- have complex health needs and sensory impairments.\n\n【35】 ## Serious mental illness\n- Defined in this guideline as: severe and incapacitating depression or anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder.\n\n【36】 ## Staff\n- Healthcare professionals and social care practitioners, including those working in community teams for adults, children or young people (such as psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, speech and language therapists, nurses, behavioural analysts, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and pharmacists); and education staff.\n\n【37】 ## Young people\n- Aged 13 to 17 years.# Recommendations for research\n- The Guideline Committee has made the following recommendations for research. The Committee's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.\n\n【38】 # Develop case identification tools for common mental health problems\n- Develop or adapt reliable and valid tools for the case identification of common mental health problems in people with learning disabilities, for routine use in primary care, social care and education settings.\n\n【39】 ## Why this is important\n- Mental health problems are often overlooked and therefore untreated in people with learning disabilities. This includes common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders, or dementia in Down's syndrome. As a result, the identification of mental health problems in people with learning disabilities was a priority for this guideline.\n reduce costs for the NHS and social care. No relevant ongoing trials were identified.\n- Existing tools with the best psychometric properties could be adapted and validated for use with people with learning disabilities, or new tools could be developed that are appropriate for use. The tools should be readily available and useable in routine health, social care and education settings (such as by GPs or caregiving staff).\n- Tools should first be adapted or developed for the most common mental health problems within this population:\n- dementia, depression and anxiety in adults\n- depression and anxiety in children and young people.\n- A series of cohort studies are needed to validate the tools (new or existing). The studies could include the following outcomes:\n- sensitivity and specificity\n- predictive validity.\n\n【40】 # Psychological interventions for children and young people with internalising disorders\n- For children and young people with learning disabilities, what psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy) are clinically and cost effective for treating internalising disorders?\n\n【41】 ## Why this is important\n- There is some evidence for the use of psychological interventions for internalising disorders in children and young people within the general population, and in adults with learning disabilities. However no evidence was found to indicate which interventions for internalising disorders are effective in children and young people with learning disabilities, or what adaptations are most helpful.\n- Psychological interventions commonly used within the general population (such as cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy) should be adapted and tested in large randomised controlled trials. This research is crucial to improving the mental health outcomes in this population, and would have a significant impact upon updates of this guideline.\n- Important outcomes could include:\n- effect on the mental health problem\n- cost effectiveness\n- health-related quality of life.\n\n【42】 # Psychological interventions for depression and anxiety disorders in adults with mild to moderate learning disabilities\n- For adults with milder learning disabilities, what is the clinical and cost effectiveness of psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (modified for people with learning disabilities) for treating depression and anxiety disorders?\n\n【43】 ## Why this is important\n reluctant to use CBT in this population. As a result, people with learning disabilities may be missing out on effective treatments. Effective treatments would reduce unnecessary suffering and impairment, improve quality of life and ultimately should reduce the demand for mental health and social care services.\n- Modifications of CBT need to be tested in large randomised controlled trials, and any modifications should be clearly explained and documented. In order to achieve an appropriate sample size, several different services may need to cooperate. Important outcomes could include:\n- effect on the mental health problem\n- cost effectiveness\n- health-related quality of life.\n\n【44】 # Pharmacological interventions for anxiety disorders in people with learning disabilities who have autism\n- What is the clinical and cost effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for anxiety disorders in people with learning disabilities who have autism?\n\n【45】 ## Why this is important\n be differences in effectiveness compared with the general population. These uncertainties about side effects and effectiveness may contribute to the under-treatment of mental health problems in people with learning disabilities who have autism. Research is therefore needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological interventions and make it clear what treatments are effective for anxiety in people learning disabilities who have autism. Clarity over this issue could have a substantial impact upon quality of life for people with learning disabilities who have autism and their carers, as well as reducing costs to the NHS.\n- Randomised controlled trials should be carried out to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for anxiety disorders in this population. Several services may need to collaborate in order to ensure sufficient sample size. Researchers would need to take into account factors such as genotype and pharmacological treatment for other conditions when designing these trials. Important outcomes could include:\n- effect on the mental health problem\n- side effects\n- cost effectiveness\n- health-related quality of life.\n\n【46】 # Psychosocial interventions for people with more severe learning disabilities\n- For people with more severe learning disabilities, what is the clinical and cost effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to treat mental health problems?\n\n【47】 ## Why this is important\n- People with more severe learning disabilities whose communication is non-verbal are likely to need tailored interventions to address mental health problems. Research is particularly limited on mental health problems in people with more severe learning disabilities. Further research is needed into different types of interventions, such as social interactions and building resilience. This research would fill a need within mental health services, which are currently limited in their ability to provide effective interventions to this group.\n- Randomised controlled trials should be carried out to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of psychosocial interventions, which may include multiple components, to prevent and treat mental health problems in people with more severe learning disabilities. Several services may need to collaborate in order to ensure sufficient sample size. Important outcomes could include:\n- effect on the mental health problem\n- cost effectiveness\n- health-related quality of life.\n- When designing these trials, appropriate measures will need to be developed for mental health problems in people with more severe learning disabilities.\n\n【48】 # The experiences of people with learning disabilities and mental health problems in services\n- What experience do people with learning disabilities have of services designed to prevent and treat mental health problems and how does this relate to clinical outcomes?\n\n【49】 ## Why this is important\n an area of national priority, as explained in the NHS Five Year Forward View.\n- To understand what experience people with learning disabilities have of services, a series of studies covering the following should be conducted:\n- The experiences and life course trajectories of young people (aged 13–17 years) in terms of their aspirations and goals, including whether the support they and their families get affects their mental health and their expected outcomes as they prepare for adulthood.\n- The experience people have of mental health inpatient services (specialist learning disability services or non-specialist services), including factors that may have prevented the need for admission and how inpatient admission affects them. Studies should include economic modelling.\n- The experience people have of being discharged from mental health inpatient services (specialist learning disability services or non-specialist services), after a stay of one year or more. In particular: the factors that may have helped them to be discharged earlier, what support is effective after discharge, and how to lower the risk of readmission.\n- The experiences people have during a crisis, including how effective crisis support is in meeting their needs, minimising risk and helping them recover.\n- The experiences of people with milder learning disabilities (including people on the autistic spectrum) and common mental health problems (such as anxiety or depression) in accessing community-based interventions.# Putting this guideline into practice\n- NICE has produced tools and resources to help you put this guideline into practice.\n- Putting recommendations into practice can take time. How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.\n- Changes recommended for clinical practice that can be done quickly – like changes in prescribing practice – should be shared quickly. This is because healthcare professionals should use guidelines to guide their work – as is required by professional regulating bodies such as the General Medical and Nursing and Midwifery Councils.\n- Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).\n- Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.\n- Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:\n. Raise awareness through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away.\n. Identify a lead with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues locally.\n. Carry out a baseline assessment against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision.\n help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation.\n. Develop an action plan, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases.\n. \n need project management support.\n. Review and monitor how well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners.\n our into practice pages \n-  Chichester: Wiley.# Context\n- People of all ages with all levels of learning disabilities can be affected by mental health problems. When a person is not able to describe or express their distress, and when they have coexisting physical health problems, their mental health problems can be difficult to identify. This leads to mental health problems remaining unrecognised, which prolongs unnecessary distress. Psychosis, bipolar disorder, dementia, behaviour that challenges, and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are all more common than in people without learning disabilities, and emotional disorders are at least as common. Some causes of learning disabilities are associated with particularly high levels of specific mental health problems (for example, affective psychosis in Prader–Willi syndrome and dementia in Down's syndrome).\n- When people with learning disabilities experience mental health problems, the symptoms are sometimes wrongly attributed to the learning disabilities or a physical health problem rather than a change in the person's mental health. Indeed, their physical health state can contribute to mental ill health, as can the degree and cause of their learning disabilities (including behavioural phenotypes), biological factors (such as pain and polypharmacy), psychological factors (such as trauma) and social factors (such as neglect, poverty and lack of social networks).\n- Population-based estimates suggest in the UK that 40% (28% if problem behaviours are excluded) of adults with learning disabilities experience mental health problems at any point in time. An estimated 36% (24% if problem behaviours are excluded) of children and young people with learning disabilities experience mental health problems at any point in time. These rates are much higher than for people who do not have learning disabilities.\n- This guideline covers the identification, assessment, treatment and prevention of mental health problems in children, young people and adults with any degree of learning disabilities. In addition, there are recommendations on support for family members, carers and care workers.\n- The guideline covers all settings (including health, social care, educational, forensic and criminal justice settings).\n- People with learning disabilities have many needs both as individuals and related to their learning disabilities. This guideline only addresses their needs in relation to mental health problems.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#37#37## Recommendations for research小标题另起一行\n缺少换行#49#49## Context小标题另起一行", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 19:28:30"}

If such a reaction occurs, therapy with desloratadine should be stopped and alternative treatment should be considered.\n\n【21】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【22】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n\n【23】 ### Adults and Adolescents\n- In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine ts at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine ts (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine.\n- The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients.\n- There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race.\n- In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine ts and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine ts and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%).\n\n【24】 ### Pediatrics\n- Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day.\n- In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects.\n- In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%).\n- In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%).\n- In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%).\n- There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.\n\n【25】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis.\n\n【26】 # Drug Interactions\n\n【27】 # Inhibitorsof Cytochrome P4503A4\n- In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or azithromycin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine.\n\n【28】 ### Fluoxetine\n- In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine.\n\n【29】 ### Cimetidine\n- In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine.\n\n【30】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【31】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, desloratadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at approximately 210 and 230 times, respectively, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. An increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted, however, in a separate study in female rats at approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The AUCs in comparison referred to the desloratadine exposure in rabbits and the sum of desloratadine and its metabolites exposures in rats, respectively.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Desloratadine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【32】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Desloratadine during labor and delivery.\n\n【33】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Desloratadine passes into breast milk; therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the nursing mother and the possible risk to the child.\n\n【34】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The recommended dose of desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine ts in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine ts or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age.\n- The desloratadine RediTabs 2.5-mg t has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the desloratadine RediTabs t and the previously marketed RediTabs t was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose-finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for desloratadine RediTabs supports the use of the 2.5-mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age.\n\n【35】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【36】 ### Gender\n increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended.\n\n【37】 ### Race\n- Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine ts, the Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in Cmax and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.\n\n【38】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended.\n- In adult patients with liver or renal impairment, a starting dose of one 5-mg t every other day is recommended based on pharmacokinetic data. Dosing recommendation for children with liver or renal impairment cannot be made due to lack of data\n\n【39】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended\n- In adult patients with liver or renal impairment, a starting dose of one 5-mg t every other day is recommended based on pharmacokinetic data. Dosing recommendation for children with liver or renal impairment cannot be made due to lack of data.\n\n【40】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A male specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic testicular changes, occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg in rats (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on fertility in rats at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 8 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).\n\n【41】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Desloratadine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【42】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【43】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【44】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Desloratadine Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【45】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Desloratadine and IV administrations.\n\n【46】 # Overdosage\n- In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis.\n- Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post-marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the desloratadine product. In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day somnolence was reported.\n- In another study, no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days.\n- Lethality occurred in rats at oral doses of 250 mg/kg or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). The oral median lethal dose in mice was 353 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 290 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m2 basis). No deaths occurred at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg in monkeys (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 810 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m2 basis).\n\n【47】 # Pharmacology\n\n【48】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2–3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\n\n【49】 ## Structure\n- It has an empirical formula: C19H19ClN2 and a molecular weight of 310.8. The chemical name is 8-chloro-6,11-dihydro-11-(4-piperdinylidene)-5H-benzocycloheptapyridine and has the following structure:\n\n【50】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n\n【51】 ### Wheal and Flare\n- Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours.\n- There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.\n\n【52】 # Effectson QTc\n- Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist.\n- In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported.\n\n【53】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n\n【54】 ### Absorption\n- Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5-mg t once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng∙hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine.\n- The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5-mg desloratadine t. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine Oral Solution.\n- The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine RediTabs ts was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 24 adult volunteers. A single desloratadine RediTabs t containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single 5-mg desloratadine RediTabs t (original formulation) for both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine. Food and water had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine RediTabs ts.\n\n【55】 ### Distribution\n- Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function.\n\n【56】 ### Metabolism\n- Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=, approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n= as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1, and Hispanics (2%, n=1,. The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine Oral Solution for 15–35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out.\n\n【57】 ### Elimination\n- The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar Tmax and half-life values compared to desloratadine.\n\n【58】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n\n【59】 ### Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis\n- The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known.\n- In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose.\n- In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).\n\n【60】 # Animal Toxicologyand/or Pharmacology\n- Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 210 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose) or in rabbits at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 230 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). In a separate study, an increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted in female rats at 24 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).\n\n【61】 # Clinical Studies\n\n【62】 # Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis\n- The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine ts were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).\n- In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine ts 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine ts to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.\n- desloratadine ts 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n- There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine ts 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.\n\n【63】 # Perennial Allergic Rhinitis\n- The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine ts 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine ts 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.\n\n【64】 # Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria\n evaluated, and during the first week of therapy desloratadine ts 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"Number of Hives\" and the \"Size of the Largest Hive,\" when compared to placebo.\n- The clinical safety of desloratadine Oral Solution was documented in three, 15-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 mg of desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of desloratadine Oral Solution administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 mg of desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of desloratadine Oral Solution in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.\n\n【65】 # How Supplied\n- Desloratadine ts\n- Film-coated ts\n- Packaged in bottles of 100 (NDC 0085-1264- and 500 (NDC 0085-1264-\n- Desloratadine Oral Solution\n- Clear orange-colored liquid containing 0.5 mg/1 mL desloratadine in a 16-ounce Amber glass bottle (NDC 0085-1334- and a 4-ounce Amber glass bottle (NDC 0085-1334-.\n\n【66】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F)\n\n【67】 # Images\n\n【68】 ## Drug Images\n\n【69】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n\n【70】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be instructed to use desloratadine as directed.\n- As there are no food effects on bioavailability, patients can be instructed that desloratadine ts, Oral Solution, or RediTabs ts may be taken without regard to meals.\n- Patients should be advised not to increase the dose or dosing frequency as studies have not demonstrated increased effectiveness at higher doses and somnolence may occur.\n- Phenylketonurics: desloratadine RediTabs ts contain phenylalanine.\n\n【71】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Desloratadine interaction has not been established.

Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5‑HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro‑inflammatory neuropeptide release.\n\n【3】 ### Pharmacodynamics\n- Blood Pressure: Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension .\n- Peripheral (Small) Arteries: In healthy volunteers (N = , a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance.\n- Heart Rate: Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan’s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate.\n\n【4】 ### Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption and Bioavailability: The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5- and 20‑mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6‑mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine‑free period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve ) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25‑mg dose).\n- A food effect trial involving administration of IMITREX ts 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high‑\tfat meal indicated that the Cmax\t and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state.\n- Distribution: Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg.\n- Metabolism: In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive.\n- Elimination: The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan.\n- Special Populations: Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years).\n- Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined.\n- Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n =  matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = , the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects.\n- The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of IMITREX ts in this population is contraindicated .\n- Gender:In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and half‑life.\n- Race: The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n =  and Caucasian (n =  healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences.\n- Drug Interaction Studies: Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors:Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels .\n- Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after co-administration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after co-administration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan.\n- In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life.\n- A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan t resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure.\n- Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:21:40"}

He invited contention in the 1950s by his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos colleague Robert Oppenheimer, and thus became ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program.\n- In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosives. He was a vigorous advocate of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, perhaps overselling the feasibility of the program. Over the course of his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 movie of the same name.\n\n【1】 ## Early life and education\n- Teller was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary to a Jewish family.  He left Hungary in 1926. The political climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his leg was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring  him to wear a prosthetic foot and leaving him with a life-long limp. Teller graduated in chemical engineering at the University of Karlsruhe and received his Ph.D. in physics under Werner Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig. Teller's Ph.D. dissertation dealt with one of the first accurate quantum mechanical treatments of the hydrogen molecular ion. In 1930 he befriended Russian physicists George Gamow and  Lev Landau. Very important for Teller's scientific and philosophical development was his life-long close friendship with a Czech physicist George Placzek. It was Placzek who arranged for young Teller a summer stay in Rome with Enrico Fermi and oriented his scientific career to nuclear physics.\n- He spent two years at the University of Göttingen and left Germany in 1933 through the aid of the Jewish Rescue Committee. He went briefly to England and moved for a year to Copenhagen, where he worked under Niels Bohr. In February 1934, he married \"Mici\" (Augusta Maria) Harkanyi, the sister of a longtime friend.\n- In 1935, thanks to George Gamow's incentive, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at the George Washington University (GWU), where he worked with Gamow until 1941. Prior to the discovery of fission in 1939, Teller was engaged as a theoretical physicist working in the fields of quantum, molecular, and nuclear physics. In 1941, after becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States, his interest turned to the use of nuclear energy, both fusion and fission.\n made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry; the so-called Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm.\n- When World War II began, Teller wanted to contribute to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.\n\n【2】 # Manhattan Project\n- In 1942, Teller was invited to be part of Robert Oppenheimer's summer planning seminar at UC Berkeley for the origins of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop the first nuclear weapons. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague Enrico Fermi about the prospects of atomic warfare, and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on nuclear fission could be used to set off an even larger nuclear fusion reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of \"just\" an atomic bomb (even though this was not yet anywhere near completion). At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the \"Super\" (an early version of what was later known as a hydrogen bomb).\n, the United States had begun development of the atomic bomb, under the supervision of Arthur Compton, chairman of the University of Chicago physics department, who coordinated uranium research with Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Chicago, and University of California at Berkeley. Eventually Compton transferred the Columbia and Princeton scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago, and Enrico Fermi moved in at the end of April 1942 and the construction of a Chicago Pile 1 began. Teller was left behind at first, but then called to Chicago two months later. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was built to design an atomic bomb under the supervision of Oppenheimer in Template:City-state. Teller moved there in April 1943.\n irk his neighbors by playing the piano late in the night. However, Teller  made some valuable contributions to bomb research, especially in the elucidation of the implosion mechanism.\n participated in this conference, and transmitted this information to Moscow. The model of Teller's \"classical Super\" was so uncertain that Oppenheimer would later say that he wished the Russians were building their own hydrogen bomb based on that design, so that it would almost certainly retard their progress on it.\n- In 1946, Teller left Los Alamos to return to the University of Chicago as a professor and close associate of Enrico Fermi and Maria Mayer.\n\n【3】 # Hydrogen bomb\n claimed that they developed their H-bomb wholly independently.\n- In 1950, calculations by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, along with confirmations by Fermi, had shown that not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with a higher amount of tritium, the energy losses in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951, after still many years of fruitless labor on the \"Super,\" an innovative idea from Ulam was seized upon by Teller and developed into the first workable design for a megaton-range hydrogen bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the Teller-Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.\n- In an interview with Scientific American from 1999, Teller told the reporter:\n- The issue is controversial. Bethe considered Teller's contribution to the invention of the H-bomb a true innovation as early as 1952, and referred to his work as a \"stroke of genius\" in 1954. In both cases, however, Bethe emphasized Teller's role as a way of stressing that the development of the H-bomb could not have been hastened by additional support or funding, and Teller greatly disagreed with Bethe's assessment. Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as J. Carson Mark) have claimed that Teller would have never gotten any closer without the assistance of Ulam and others. Ulam himself claimed that Teller only produced a \"more generalized\" version of Ulam's original design.\n- The breakthrough—the details of which are still classified—was apparently the separation of the fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the radiation produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel before igniting it. However, compression alone would not have been enough and the other crucial idea—staging the bomb by separating the primary and secondary—seems to have been exclusively contributed by Ulam. Also, Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that radiation from the primary would do the job much earlier and more efficiently. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed that the idea to use the radiation would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of radiation right away was because he was already working on the \"Greenhouse\" tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of the energy from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.\n- Whatever the actual components of the so-called Teller-Ulam design and the respective contributions of those who worked on it, after it was proposed it was immediately seen by the scientists working on the project as the answer which had been so long sought. Those who previously had doubted whether a fission-fusion bomb would be feasible at all were converted into believing that it was only a matter of time before both the USA and the USSR had developed multi-megaton weapons. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea \"technically sweet.\"\n, Teller became known in the press as the \"father of the hydrogen bomb.\" Teller himself refrained from attending the test—he claimed not to feel welcome at the Pacific Proving Grounds—and instead saw its results on a seismograph in the basement of a hall in Berkeley.\n- By analyzing the fallout from this test, the Soviets (led in their H-bomb work by Soviet scientist Andrei Sakharov) could have easily deduced that the new design had used compression as the key initiator. However, this was later denied by the Soviet bomb researchers, who later claimed that they were not yet at that time organized to collect fallout data from U.S. tests. Because of official secrecy, little information about the bomb's development was released by the government, and press reports often attributed the entire weapon's design and development to Teller and his new Livermore Laboratory (when it was actually developed by Los Alamos).\n- Many of Teller's colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled \"The Work of Many People,\" which appeared in Science magazine in February 1955, emphasizing that he was not alone in the weapon's development. He would later write in his memoirs that he had told a \"white lie\" in the 1955 article in order to \"soothe ruffled feelings\", and claimed full credit for the invention.\n- Teller was known for getting engrossed in projects which were theoretically interesting but practically unfeasible (the classic \"Super\" was one such project.) About his work on the hydrogen bomb, Bethe said:\n advocated the development of a bomb using uranium hydride, which many of his fellow theorists said would be unlikely to work. At Livermore, Teller continued work on the hydride bomb, and the result was a dud. Ulam once wrote to a colleague about an idea he had shared with Teller: \"Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities; this is perhaps an indication they will not work.\" Fermi once said that Teller was the only monomaniac he knew who had several manias.\n- Carey Sublette of Nuclear Weapon Archive argues that Ulam came up with the radiation implosion compression design of thermonuclear weapons, but that on the other hand Teller has gotten little credit for being the first to propose fusion boosting in 1945, which is essential for miniaturization and reliability and is used in all of today's nuclear weapons.\n\n【4】 # Oppenheimer controversy\n- The rift between Teller and many of his colleagues was widened in 1954 when he testified against Robert Oppenheimer, former head of Los Alamos and member of the Atomic Energy Commission, at Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial he was the only member of the scientific community to label Oppenheimer a security risk.\n- Asked at the hearing by prosecutor Roger Robb whether he was planning \"to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States,\" Teller replied that:\n- However, he was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a \"security risk\", to which he testified:\n testified that Oppenheimer's opinion about the thermonuclear program seemed to be based more on the scientific feasibility of the weapon than anything else. He additionally testified that Oppenheimer's direction of Los Alamos was \"a very outstanding achievement\" both as a scientist and an administrator, lauding his \"very quick mind\" and that he made \"just a most wonderful and excellent director.\"\n- After this, however, he detailed ways in which he felt that Oppenheimer had hindered his efforts towards an active thermonuclear development program, and at length criticized Oppenheimer's decisions not to invest more work onto the question at different points in his career, saying:\n- After a public hearing, the authorities agreed with Teller. Oppenheimer's security clearance was eventually stripped, and Teller was treated as a pariah by many of his former colleagues. In response, Teller began to run with a more military and governmental crowd, becoming the scientific darling of conservative politicians and thinkers for his advocacy of American scientific and technological supremacy. After the fact, Teller consistently denied that he was intending to damn Oppenheimer, and even claimed that he was attempting to exonerate him. Documentary evidence has suggested that this was likely not the case, however. Six days before the testimony, Teller met with an AEC liaison officer and suggested \"deepening the charges\" in his testimony. It has been suggested that Teller's testimony against Oppenheimer was an attempt to remove Oppenheimer from power so that Teller could become the leader of the American nuclear scientist community.\n\n【5】 # Government work and political advocacy\n served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he stepped down from the directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.\n- After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by much of the scientific community, but for obvious reasons was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as the chair of the Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and later headed an effort at General Atomics to design research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be theoretically impossible (the TRIGA).\n- Teller established the Department of Applied Science at the University of California, Davis and LLNL in 1963, which holds the Edward Teller endowed professorship in his honor. In 1975 he retired from both the lab and Berkeley, and was named Director Emeritus of the Livermore Laboratory and appointed Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution. After the fall of communism in Hungary in 1989, he made several visits to his country of origin, and paid careful attention to the political changes there.\n\n【6】 # Operation Plowshareand Project Chariot\n- Teller was one of the strongest and best-known advocates for investigating non-military uses of nuclear explosives, known as Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.\n- Other scientists criticized the project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the Inupiat people living near the designated area, who were not officially told of the plan until March 1960. Additionally, it turned out that the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was cancelled in 1962.\n had Teller's endorsement was a plan to extract oil from the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions. The plan actually received the endorsement of the Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada.\n\n【7】 # Nuclear weapons and Israel\n persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the Negev Nuclear Research Center in Dimona.\n\n【8】 # Three Mile Island\n, under the headline \"I was the only victim of Three-Mile Island\", which opened with:\n- The next day, The New York Times ran an editorial criticizing the ad, noting that it was sponsored by Dresser Industries, the firm which had manufactured one of the defective valves which contributed to the Three Mile Island accident.\n\n【9】 # Strategic Defense Initiative\n- In the 1980s, Teller began a strong campaign for what was later called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), derided by critics as \"Star Wars,\" the concept of using lasers or satellites to destroy incoming Russian ICBMs. Teller lobbied with government agencies—and got the sanction of President Ronald Reagan—for his plan to develop a system using elaborate satellites which used atomic weapons to fire X-ray lasers at incoming missiles— as part of a broader scientific research program into defenses against nuclear weapons. However, scandal erupted when Teller (and his associate Lowell Wood) were accused of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error. His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers. Many prominent scientists argued that the system was futile. Bethe, along with IBM physicist Richard Garwin and Cornell University colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in Scientific American which analyzed the system and concluded that any putative enemy could disable such a system by the use of suidecoys. The project's funding was eventually scaled back.\n- Many scientists opposed strategic defense on moral or political rather than purely technical grounds. They argued that, even if an effective system could be produced, it would undermine the system of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) that had prevented all-out war between the western democracies and the communist bloc. An effective defense, they contended, would make such a war \"winnable\" and therefore more likely.\n- Despite (or perhaps because of) his hawkish reputation, Teller made a public point of noting that he regretted the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian cities during World War II. He further claimed that before the bombing of Hiroshima he had indeed lobbied Oppenheimer to use the weapons first in a \"demonstration\" which could be witnessed by the Japanese high-command and citizenry before using them to inflict thousands of deaths. The \"father of the hydrogen bomb\" would use this quasi-anti-nuclear stance (he would say that he believed nuclear weapons to be unfortunate, but that the arms race was unavoidable due to the intracnature of Communism) to promote technologies such as SDI, arguing that they were needed to make sure that nuclear weapons could never be used again (Better a shield than a sword was the title of one of his books on the subject).\n:\n- The historian Barton Bernstein argued that it is an \"unconvincing claim\" by Teller that he was a \"covert dissenter\" to the use of the weapon. In his 2001 Memoirs, Teller claims that he did lobby Oppenheimer, but that Oppenheimer had convinced him that he should take no action and that the scientists should leave military questions in the hands of the military; Teller claims he was not aware that Oppenheimer and other scientists were being consulted as to the actual use of the weapon and implies that Oppenheimer was being hypocritical.\n\n【10】 # Legacy\n made contributions to Thomas-Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.\n rumored to be the inspiration for the character of Dr. Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 satirical film of the same name (other inspirations have been speculated to be RAND theorist Herman Kahn, rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara). In the aforementioned Scientific American interview from 1999, he was reported as having bristled at the question: \"My name is not Strangelove. I don't know about Strangelove. I'm not interested in Strangelove. What else can I say?\\. Look. Say it three times more, and I throw you out of this office.\"\n- Nobel Prize winning physicist Isidor I. Rabi once suggested that \"It would have been a better world without Teller.\"  In addition, Teller's false claims that Stanislaw Ulam made no significant contribution to the development of the hydrogen bomb (despite Ulam's key insights of using compression and staging elements to generate the thermonuclear reaction) and his vicious personal attacks on Oppenheimer caused even greater animosity within the general physics community towards Teller.\n named as part of the group of \"U.S. Scientists\" who were Time magazine's People of the Year in 1960, and an asteroid, 5006 Teller, is named after him. He was awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush less than two months before his death.\n\n【11】 ↑ \"I have always considered that description in poor taste.\" Teller, Memoirs, p. 546.\n↑ Jump up to: 2.0 2.1 2.2\n\n【12】  \"Interview with Edward Teller, part 40.

There is a Black Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include hypertension, piloerection, pruritus, shivering, paresthesia, dysuria, urinary retention, and urinary frequency.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【5】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n- Midodrine hydrochloride ts are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because midodrine hydrochloride ts can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP>200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on midodrine hydrochloride t's effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride ts, principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride ts.\n- After initiation of treatment, midodrine hydrochloride ts should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.\n- Dosing Information\n- The recommended dose of midodrine hydrochloride ts is 10 mg, 3 times daily.\n- Dosing should take place during the daytime hours when the patient needs to be upright, pursuing the activities of daily living. A suggested dosing schedule of approximately 4-hour intervals is as follows: shortly before or upon arising in the morning, midday and late afternoon (not later than 6 P.M.). Doses may be given in 3-hour intervals, if required, to control symptoms, but not more frequently.\n- Single doses as high as 20 mg have been given to patients, but severe and persistent systolic supine hypertension occurs at a high rate (about 45%) at this dose. In order to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep, midodrine hydrochloride ts should not be given after the evening meal or less than 4 hours before bedtime. Total daily doses greater than 30 mg have been tolerated by some patients, but their safety and usefulness have not been studied systematically or established. Because of the risk of supine hypertension, midodrine hydrochloride ts should be continued only in patients who appear to attain symptomatic improvement during initial treatment.\n- The supine and standing blood pressure should be monitored regularly and the administration of midodrine hydrochloride ts should be stopped if supine blood pressure increases excessively.\n- Because desglymidodrine is excreted renally, dosing in patients with abnormal renal function should be cautious; although this has not been systematically studied, it is recommended that treatment of these patients be initiated using 2.5 mg doses.\n- Blood levels of midodrine and desglymidodrine were similar when comparing levels in patients 65 or older vs. younger than 65 and when comparing males vs. females, suggesting dose modifications for these groups are not necessary.\n\n【6】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n\n【7】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Midodrine in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- Midodrine up to 15 mg 3 times daily was used to treat severely symptomatic neurocardiogenic syncope.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n\n【10】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【11】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n\n【12】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Midodrine in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Midodrine in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\n- Severe organic heart disease\n- Acute renal disease\n- Urinary retention\n- Pheochromocytoma\n- Thyrotoxicosis\n- Persistent and excessive supine hypertension\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Supine Hypertension\n elevated by midodrine hydrochloride therapy. It is essential to monitor supine and sitting blood pressures in patients maintained on midodrine hydrochloride.\n\n【16】 ### Precautions\n- The potential for supine and sitting hypertension should be evaluated at the beginning of midodrine hydrochloride therapy. Supine hypertension can often be controlled by preventing the patient from becoming fully supine, i.e., sleeping with the head of the bed elevated. The patient should be cautioned to report symptoms of supine hypertension immediately. Symptoms may include cardiac awareness, pounding in the ears, headache, blurred vision, etc.\n- The patient should be advised to discontinue the medication immediately if supine hypertension persists. Blood pressure should be monitored carefully when midodrine hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other agents that cause vasoconstriction, such as phenylephrine, ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, phenylpropanolamine or pseudoephedrine.\n- A slight slowing of the heart rate may occur after administration of midodrine hydrochloride, primarily due to vagal reflex. Caution should be exercised when midodrine hydrochloride is used concomitantly with cardiac glycosides (such as digitalis), psychopharmacologic agents, beta blockers or other agents that directly or indirectly reduce heart rate. Patients who experience any signs or symptoms suggesting bradycardia (pulse slowing, increased dizziness, syncope, cardiac awareness) should be advised to discontinue midodrine hydrochloride and should be re-evaluated.\n- Midodrine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with urinary retention problems, as desglymidodrine acts on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the bladder neck.\n taking fludrocortisone acetate, which is known to cause an increase in intraocular pressure and glaucoma.\n- Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Because desglymidodrine is eliminated via the kidneys and higher blood levels would be expected in such patients, midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, with a starting dose of 2.5 mg. Renal function should be assessed prior to initial use of midodrine hydrochloride.\n- Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as the liver has a role in the metabolism of midodrine.\n- Laboratory Tests\n- Since desglymidodrine is eliminated by the kidneys and the liver has a role in its metabolism, evaluation of the patient should include assessment of renal and hepatic function prior to initiating therapy and subsequently, as appropriate.\n\n【17】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【18】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most frequent adverse reactions seen in controlled trials were supine and sitting hypertension; paresthesia and pruritus, mainly of the scalp; goosebumps; chills; urinary urge; urinary retention and urinary frequency.\n- The frequency of these events in a 3-week placebo-controlled trial is shown in the following :\n- Less frequent adverse reactions were headache; feeling of pressure/fullness in the head; vasodilation/flushing face; confusion/thinking abnormality; dry mouth; nervousness/anxiety and rash. Other adverse reactions that occurred rarely were visual field defect; dizziness; skin hyperesthesia; insomnia; somnolence; erythema multiforme; canker sore; dry skin; dysuria; impaired urination; asthenia; backache; pyrosis; nausea; gastrointestinal distress; flatulence; and leg cramps.\n- The most potentially serious adverse reaction associated with midodrine hydrochloride therapy is supine hypertension. The feelings of paresthesia, pruritus, piloerection and chills are pilomotor reactions associated with the action of midodrine on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the hair follicles. Feelings of urinary urgency, urinary retention and urinary frequency are associated with the action of midodrine on the alpha-receptors of the bladder neck.\n\n【19】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Midodrine in the drug label.\n\n【20】 # Drug Interactions\n- When administered concomitantly with midodrine hydrochloride, cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, AV block or arrhythmia.\n- The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of midodrine hydrochloride. Therefore, caution should be used when midodrine hydrochloride is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction.\n- Midodrine hydrochloride has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation. The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with midodrine hydrochloride. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of midodrine hydrochloride.\n responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide, and quinidine. Thus there may be a potential for drug-drug interaction with these drugs.\n\n【21】 # Usein Specific Populations\n\n【22】 ### Pregnancy\n- Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category C\n- Midodrine hydrochloride increased the rate of embryo resorption, reduced fetal body weight in rats and rabbits and decreased fetal survival in rabbits when given in doses 13 (rat) and 7 (rabbit) times the maximum human dose based on body surface area (mg/m. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Midodrine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects have been observed in studies in rats and rabbits.\n- Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Midodrine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【23】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Midodrine during labor and delivery.\n\n【24】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when midodrine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【25】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【26】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【27】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【28】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【29】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【31】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Midodrine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【32】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Midodrine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【33】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【34】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【35】 ### Monitoring\n- The supine and standing blood pressure should be monitored regularly and the administration of midodrine hydrochloride ts should be stopped if supine blood pressure increases excessively.\n\n【36】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Midodrine in the drug label.\n\n【37】 # Overdosage\n\n【38】 ## Acute Overdose\n\n【39】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of overdose could include hypertension, piloerection (goosebumps), a sensation of coldness and urinary retention. There are 2 reported cases of overdosage with midodrine hydrochloride, both in young males. One patient ingested midodrine hydrochloride drops, 250 mg, experienced systolic blood pressure greater than 200 mmHg, was treated with an IV injection of 20 mg of phentolamine and was discharged the same night without any complaints.\n- The other patient ingested 205 mg of midodrine hydrochloride (41 5-mg ts) and was found lethargic and unable to talk, unresponsive to voice but responsive to painful stimuli, hypertensive and bradycardic. Gastric lavage was performed and the patient recovered fully by the next day without sequelae. The single doses that would be associated with symptoms of overdosage or would be potentially life-threatening are unknown. The oral LD50 is approximately 30 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg in rats, 675 mg/kg in mice and 125 mg/kg to 160 mg/kg in dogs.\n\n【40】 ### Management\n- Desglymidodrine is dialyzable.\n- Recommended general treatment, based on the pharmacology of the drug, includes induced emesis and administration of alpha-sympatholytic drugs (e.g., phentolamine).\n\n【41】 ## Chronic Overdose\n- There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Midodrine in the drug label.\n\n【42】 # Pharmacology\n\n【43】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Midodrine hydrochloride forms an active metabolite, desglymidodrine, that is an alpha1-agonist and exerts its actions via activation of the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature, producing an increase in vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine does not stimulate cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. Desglymidodrine diffuses poorly across the blood-brain barrier and is therefore not associated with effects on the central nervous system.\n- Administration of midodrine hydrochloride results in a rise in standing, sitting and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with orthostatic hypotension of various etiologies. Standing systolic blood pressure is elevated by approximately 15 mmHg to 30 mmHg at 1 hour after a 10 mg dose of midodrine, with some effect persisting for 2 to 3 hours. Midodrine hydrochloride has no clinically significant effect on standing or supine pulse rates in patients with autonomic failure.\n\n【44】 ## Structure\n- Midodrine hydrochloride is a vasopressor/antihypotensive agent. Midodrine hydrochloride is an odorless, white, crystalline powder, soluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol having a pKa of 7.8 (0.3% aqueous solution), a pH of 3.5 to 5.5 (5% aqueous solution) and a melting range of 200°C to 203°C. It is chemically described as:  Acetamide, 2-amino-N--monohydrochloride, (±)-; or  (±)-2-amino-N-(ß-hydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)acetamide monohydrochloride. Midodrine Hydrochloride’s molecular formula is C12H18N2O4HCl, its molecular weight is 290.7 and its structural formula is:\n- Each t for oral administration contains 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of midodrine hydrochloride and the following inactive ingredients: pregelatinized starch (corn starch), microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate. In addition, the 5 mg ts contain FD&C yellow No. 6 aluminum lake and FD&C red No. 40 aluminum lake and the 10 mg ts contain FD&C blue No. 2 aluminum lake.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Thorough metabolic studies have not been conducted, but it appears that deglycination of midodrine to desglymidodrine takes place in many tissues and both compounds are metabolized in part by the liver. Neither midodrine nor desglymidodrine is a substrate for monoamine oxidase. Renal elimination of midodrine is insignificant. The renal clearance of desglymidodrine is of the order of 385 mL/minute, most, about 80%, by active renal secretion. The actual mechanism of active secretion has not been studied, but it is possible that it occurs by the base-secreting pathway responsible for the secretion of several other drugs that are bases\n\n【46】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Midodrine hydrochloride is a prodrug, i.e., the therapeutic effect of orally administered midodrine is due to the major metabolite desglymidodrine, formed by deglycination of midodrine. After oral administration, midodrine hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed. The plasma levels of the prodrug peak after about half an hour and decline with a half-life of approximately 25 minutes, while the metabolite reaches peak blood concentrations about 1 to 2 hours after a dose of midodrine and has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of midodrine (measured as desglymidodrine) is 93%. The bioavailability of desglymidodrine is not affected by food. Approximately the same amount of desglymidodrine is formed after intravenous and oral administration of midodrine. Neither midodrine nor desglymidodrine is bound to plasma proteins to any significant extent.\n\n【47】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Long-term studies have been conducted in rats and mice at dosages of 3 to 4 times the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m2 basis, with no indication of carcinogenic effects related to midodrine hydrochloride. Studies investigating the mutagenic potential of midodrine hydrochloride revealed no evidence of mutagenicity. Other than the dominant lethal assay in male mice, where no impairment of fertility was observed, there have been no studies on the effects of midodrine hydrochloride on fertility.\n\n【48】 # Clinical Studies\n- Midodrine has been studied in 3 principal controlled trials, one of 3-weeks duration and 2 of 1 to 2 days duration. All studies were randomized, double-blind and parallel-design trials in patients with orthostatic hypotension of any etiology and supine-to-standing fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg accompanied by at least moderate dizziness/lightheadedness.\n- Patients with pre-existing sustained supine hypertension above 180/110 mmHg were routinely excluded. In a 3-week study in 170 patients, most previously untreated with midodrine, the midodrine-treated patients (10 mg t.i.d., with the last dose not later than 6 P.M.) had significantly higher (by about 20 mmHg) 1-minute standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing (blood pressures were not measured at other times) for all 3 weeks. After week 1, midodrine-treated patients had small improvements in dizziness/ lightheadedness/unsteadiness scores and global evaluations, but these effects were made difficult to interpret by a high early drop-out rate (about 25% vs 5% on placebo). Supine and sitting blood pressure rose 16/8 mmHg and 20/10 mmHg, respectively, on average.\n at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing.

Crossbite can involve a single tooth or a group of teeth. Crossbite can be classified as anterior or posterior.\n be referred as negative overjet, and is typical of class III skeletal relations (Progenism).\n- Posterior crossbite is often correlated to a narrow maxilla and upper dental arch. A posterior cross-bite can be unilateral or bilateral.\n- Unilateral cross-bite often determines a lateral shift of the mandibular position, which can become structural if left untreated for a long time during growth, leading to skeletal asymmetries.\n\n【2】 # Etiology\n- A crossbite may be associated with a pathological condition. A cleft palate patient may present both anterior and posterior crossbites with a narrow palate. Arthritis, acromegaly, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, condylar hyperplasia and osteochondroma are other factors. The majority of anterior crossbites a single tooth or a few teeth and are caused by dental factors: A congenitally-caused eruption pattern of the maxillary anteriors. Trauma to the primary dentition which leads to the displacement of the primary or permanent tooth bud. Trauma to permanent teeth that result in their being displaced by luxation.\n- Other factors include;\n- Stomach sleeping posture\n- Digit or pacifier sucking habits\n- Oral respiration\n- Low tongue position\n- Tongue thrusting\n\n【3】 # Further Classificationand Related Terminology\n\n【4】 ## Buccal Crossbite\n- Buccal crossbite is due to the buccal displacement of the affected tooth or teeth as it relates to the antagonistic tooth or teeth in the posterior segments of the arch.\n\n【5】 ## Lingual Crossbite\n- Lingual crossbite is due to the lingual displacement of the mandibular affected tooth or teeth as it relates to the antagonistic tooth or teeth.\n\n【6】 ## Palatal Crossbite\n- Palatal crossbite is due to the palatal displacement of the maxillary affected tooth or teeth as it relates to the antagonistic tooth or teeth.\n\n【7】 # Complete Mandibular Buccal Crossbite\n- Complete mandibular buccal crossbite is present when all the mandibular teeth are lingually positioned to the maxillary teeth due to a narrower mandibular arch than the maxillary arch.\n\n【8】 # Complete Maxillary Palatal Crossbite\n- Complete maxillary palatal crossbite is present when all the maxillary teeth are palatal to the mandibular arch due to the narrower maxillary arch.\n- Both complete mandibular buccal crossbite and complete maxillary palatal crossbite could be referred as scissors-bite.\n\n【9】 ## Complete Crossbite\n- Complete crossbite is found when all teeth in one arch are positioned either inside or outside to the all teeth in the opposing arch.\n\n【10】 ## Scissors-bite\n- Scissors-bite is present when one or more of the adjacent posterior teeth are either positioned completely buccally or lingually to the antagonistic teeth and exhibit a vertical overlap.\n\n【11】 ## Anterior crossbite\n- Anterior crossbite is a malocclusion in which one or more of the upper anterior teeth occlude lingually to the mandibular incisors; the lingual malpositions of one or more maxillary anterior teeth in relation to the mandibular anterior teeth when the teeth are in centric relation occlusion.\n\n【12】 ## Posterior Crossbite\n- Posterior Crossbite is one or more posterior teeth locked in an abnormal relation with the opposing teeth of the opposite arch; can be either buccal or a lingual cross-bite and may be accompanied by a shift of the mandible.\n\n【13】 ## Centric occlusion\n- Centric occlusion is a static reproducible position of the mandible in which there is maximal contact of the inclined planes of the opposing teeth with balanced, unstrained relationship in the temporomandibular articulation.\n\n【14】 # Treatment\n- There are several therapies that can be used to correct a cross bite:\n- Multibrackets therapy (braces)\n- Quad-Helix\n- Hirex\n- Removable Plates\n- Invisalign\n- Delaire Mask\n- The correct therapy should be decided by the orthodontist depending on the type and severity of the crossbite.\n\n【15】 - Unilateral Posterior Crossbite\n- Crossbite\n- Crossbite  (Image courtesy of Berna Zorkun DMD and copylefted)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语意重复#15#15#Crossbite", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 18:34:32"}

Human IgG1 directed against cell surface TF is the antibody. Extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is primarily initiated by TF. A protease-cleavable linker is used to attach the antibody to a microtubule-disrupting agent called MMAE.\n- The mechanism seen in nonclinical studies show TF expressing cancer cells binds to ADC of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv which is followed by ADC-TF complex internalization, and the release though proteolytic cleavage of MMAE. Apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest occurs with the disruption of microtubule networks of actively dividing cells by MMAE.\n- In vitro, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis are mediated by Tisotumab vedotin-tftv treatment.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\n- Tisotumab vedotin-tftv is a  tissue factor (TF)-directed antibody drug conjugate for Oral Administration. It has a molecular weight of 153 kDa.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Cardiac Electrophysiology\n- There was no large mean effect on QTc prolongation when given Tisotumab vedotin-tftv at the recommended dosage.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Exposure Parameters\n- Near the end of infusion, Tisotumab vedotin-tftv showed a peak in concentrations after patients received one 3-week cycle of tisotumab vedotin-tftv 2 mg/kg.\n2 to 3 days after patients received their Tisotumab vedotin-tftv dose, concentrations of un-conjugated MMAE peaked.\n- After patients received a single dosage (0.3–2.2 mg/kg) of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv, the AUC0-last of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv increased in a more than dose-proportional manner while the Cmax of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv increased proportionally.\n- Un-conjugated MMAE and Tisotumab vedotin-tftv had no accumulation.\n- After 1 treatment cycle, un-conjugated MMAE and tisotumab vedotin-tftv reached their steady-state concentrations.\n-  shows the Parameters of Exposure found in Un-conjugated MMAE and Tisotumab Vedotin-tftv.\n- Distribution\n7.83 L is the steady state volume of distribution found in Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n- In vitro, MMAE has a 68% to 82% plasma protein binding percentage.\n- Elimination\n4.04 days is the median terminal half-life found in Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n2.56 days is the median terminal half-life found in un-conjugated MMAE.\n1.54 L/day is the linear clearance found in Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n45.9 L/day is the linear clearance found in un-conjugated MMAE.\n- Metabolism\n- Amino acids, un-conjugated MMAE-related catabolites, small peptides, and un-conjugated MMAE are catabolized by Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n- In vitro, un-conjugated MMAE is released during proteolytic cleavage by Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n- In vitro, CYP3A4 primarily metabolizes a un-conjugated MMAE.\n- Excretion\n- In feces after a single dosage of an ADC that contains MMAE over the span of 1 week, 17% of MMAE was found in which most was found unchanged.\n- In urine after a single dosage of an ADC that contains MMAE over the span of 1 week, 6% of MMAE was found in which most was found unchanged.\n- Excretion patterns of MMAE should be similar when patient are given Tisotumab vedotin-tftv to when patients are given a single dosage of an ADC that contains MMAE.\n- Specific Populations\n- Sex, age (21 to 81 years), ethnicity, and race showed no clinically significant differences in Tisotumab vedotin-tftv pharmacokinetics.\n- Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment showed no clinically significant differences in exposures to patients with normal renal function when given Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n- Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n- Patients with mild hepatic impairment showed a 37% increase in exposures of un-conjugated MMAE compared to patients with normal hepatic function.\n- Drug Interaction Studies\n- Clinical Studies:\n- Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The C­max of un-conjugated MMAE increased by 25% with concomitant use an ADC that contains MMAE and Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). The AUC of un-conjugated MMAE increased by 34% with concomitant use an ADC that contains MMAE and Ketoconazole. No changes to exposure were detected in ADC with concomitant use an ADC that contains MMAE and Ketoconazole.\n- Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: The C­max of un-conjugated MMAE decreased by 44% with concomitant use an ADC that contains MMAE and Rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer).

No changes to exposure were detected in ADC with concomitant use an ADC that contains MMAE and Rifampin.\n- In Vitro Studies:\n- Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP2C19 are not inhibited by MMAE. In human hepatocytes, major CYP450 enzymes are not induced by MMAE.\n- Transporter Systems: A substrate of P-gp is MMAE. P-gp is not inhibited by MMAE.\n\n【42】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- No animal studies have been conducted with either tisotumab vedotin-tftv or MMAE to test carcinogenicity.\n- In vivo, rat bone marrow micronucleus study showed positive genotoxicity in MMAE.\n- The L5178 TK+/- mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay or bacterial reverse mutation assay showed that MMAE showed no signs of being  mutagenic.\n- Impaired male fertility and reproductive function may potential occur when taking Tisotumab vedotin-tftv based on repeat-dose toxicity study done on monkeys.\n- Reduction or absence in sperm count, decreased seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm motility, and decreased testicular size was seen in monkeys part of the repeat-dose toxicology study that was conducted for 13 weeks. These monkeys received doses that were ≥1 mg/kg Tisotumab vedotin-tftv. When monkeys received doses ≥3 mg/kg of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv, decreased motility and sperm absence did not reverse during the recovery period.\n\n【43】 # Clinical Studies\n- Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer\n- An innovaTV 204 study was conducted on 101 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer to study the efficacy of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv. The patient population was largely Caucasian (95%), included 68% patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and had a median age of 50 years. These patients received at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and one other prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. 70% of patients received 1 prior line of systemic therapy while 30% of patients had 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Out of all the patients in the study, 63% received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as systematic therapy while 69% of patients received  bevacizumab as part of their prior systemic therapy. The study was an open-label, multi-center, and single-arm trial. The patients received 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks of Tisotumab vedotin-tftv unless there was unacceptoxicity or disease progression. The efficacy results are reported in the below.\n-  shows the Efficacy of Tisotumabn vedotin-tftv in the InnovaTV 204 Study.\n\n【44】 # How Supplied\n- A single 40 mg single-dose vial carton.\n\n【45】 ## Storage\n- Store at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF).\n- Protect from light using the original carton.\n- Do not freeze.\n- Do not shake.\n\n【46】 # Images\n\n【47】 ## Drug Images\n\n【48】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n\n【49】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Ocular Adverse Reactions\n- Advise patients before starting Tisotumab vedotin-tftv treatment and prior to each dose should take an eye exam.\n- Advise patients about the possible ocular adverse reactions, and to immediately seek medical attention when experiencing new or worsening ocular symptoms.\n- Advise patients before each infusion to bring eye drops.\n- Advise patients to only wear eye contacts during treatment if told by a doctor.\n- Peripheral Neuropathy\n- Advise patients to report any signs of tingling and numbness of the hands or feet to their doctor.\n- Advise patients to report any signs muscle weakness to their doctor.\n- Hemorrhage\n- Advise patients that show symptoms of hemorrhage or unusual severe bleeding to seek immediate medical attention.\n- Pneumonitis\n- Advise patients to report any new or worsening respiratory symptoms immediately to medical provider.\n- Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n- Advise female patients of reproductive potential and pregnant women about potential risk to the fetus when taking Tisotumab vedotin-tftv.\n- Advise female patients of reproductive potential to report to their healtcare provider any known or suspected pregnancy.\n- Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tisotumab vedotin-tftv and for at least 2 months after the last dose.\n- Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tisotumab vedotin-tftv and for at least 4 months after the last dose.\n- Lactation\n- Advise female patients to not nurse when taking Tisotumab vedotin-tftv and for 3 weeks after the last dose.\n\n【50】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Tisotumab vedotin-tftv interaction has not been established.

All epidural medications given during labor cross the placenta and affect the fetus, and it has been shown that pain medication can affect the feeding behavior of the newborn  and reduce the chances of successful breastfeeding.\n increases the probability of a healthier postnatal period and an easier recovery due to better hormonal balance and less post-operative discomforts. This is because a woman who has given birth with minimal intervention does not have to recover from major abdominal surgery (caesarean section), instrumental delivery (by forceps or ventouse), cutting of the perineum, called episiotomy) (although the perineum will sometimes tear during childbirth anyway), bruises from IV lines,  or severe headache backache (a possible and well-documented side effect of epidurals).  Natural childbirth maximizes the innate birth physiology and laboring movement of healthy, well-nourished women and minimizes interventions in the normal course of spontaneous childbirth.\n\n【3】 # Alternatives to anesthetics\n- Pain management techniques other than medication include:\n- hydrotherapy\n- massage\n- relaxation therapy\n- hypnobirthing\n- breathing exercises\n- vocalization\n- visualization\n- mindfulness\n- movement and different positions (i.e. using a birthing ball)\n- hot and cold therapy (i.e. using hot compresses and/or cold packs)\n- having one-on-one labor support, such as a midwife or doula\n- It should be noted that it is common to defecate while giving birth.\n\n【4】 # Psychological benefits\n- Many women consider natural birth empowering.  A woman who is supported to labor as she instinctively wants to is a woman who will likely feel positive about her birth experience and future parenting skills.     Her baby is more able to be alert and placed on her skin (promoting maternal bonding) and breastfeeding is more likely to be enjoyable and successful.\n\n【5】 # Preparation\n- The Lamaze, Bradley Method, Birthing From Within, and Calm Birth are popular systems to help parents-to-be prepare for the birth process in general, and emphasize natural birth in particular.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-09 00:20:17", "update_time": "2024-04-10 00:22:06"}
