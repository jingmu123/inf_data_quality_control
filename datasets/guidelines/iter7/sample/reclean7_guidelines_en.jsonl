Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.\n- Do not apply hydrogen peroxide topical solution to open or infected seborrheic keratoses.\n- During a single in-office treatment session, apply hydrogen peroxide to seborrheic keratosis lesions 4 times, approximately 1 minute apart. After one use, discard the unit dose applicator.\n- If the treated lesions have not completely cleared approximately 3 weeks after treatment, another treatment may be administered following the same procedure.\nPreparation of lesions\n- Prior to application of hydrogen peroxide, clean seborrheic keratoses to be treated using an alcohol wipe. When treating seborrheic keratoses on the face, take appropriate actions to ensure that hydrogen peroxide will not come into contact with the eyes.\n- Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the activation of the hydrogen peroxide applicator and during the administration of the solution to the lesion(s).\n- The method for preparing the hydrogen peroxide applicator for use is illustrated below. While activating the applicator, hold it away from the patient.\n- Following release of the solution from the ampule, remove the cap from the hydrogen peroxide applicator. Gently squeeze the applicator barrel to express a drop of hydrogen peroxide and ensure wetting of the applicator tip. Apply solution directly to the seborrheic keratosis in a circular motion. Apply enough solution to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping. During the application, remove any excess solution from the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe (do not use paper towels or tissue). Apply again in the same manner, 3 additional applications 1 minute apart.\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\n- Improvement or resolution of seborrheic keratotic lesions may be indicative of efficacy.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Hydrogen peroxide (Eskata) and IV administrations.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\n- Topical overdosing of hydrogen peroxide could result in an increased incidence and severity of local skin reactions.\n\n【28】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The mechanism of action for hydrogen peroxide for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis is unknown.\n\n【29】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The pharmacodynamics of hydrogen peroxide in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis are unknown.\n\n【30】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Following application of hydrogen peroxide in patients with seborrheic keratosis lesions, hydrogen peroxide rapidly dissociates into water and reactive oxygen species. Indirect assessment of reactive oxygen species in patients with seborrheic keratosis lesions did not demonstrate any systemic absorption of hydrogen peroxide.\n\n【31】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydrogen peroxide.\n- Hydrogen peroxide has been found to exhibit positive results in in vitro tests for genotoxicity, but has not exhibited positive results in in vivo tests for genotoxicity, presumably due to the rapid metabolism of hydrogen peroxide.\n- The effects of hydrogen peroxide on fertility have not been evaluated. Hydrogen peroxide has been associated with effects on sperm function and elevated testicular hydrogen peroxide concentration has been implicated in male infertility, although in vivo, no effect of hydrogen peroxide on sperm function has been demonstrated.\n\n【32】 #Clinical Studies\n- In two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, 937 subjects with 4 clinically typical seborrheic keratoses that are raised on the face, trunk, or extremities were randomized to treatment with either ESKATA or vehicle. Subjects ranged from 42 to 91 years of age (mean 68.7 years), 58% percent were female, and 98% were Caucasian. A total of 925 subjects completed the trials. Each lesion was treated with 4 applications, at baseline and again at Day 22, if needed, and subjects were followed through Day 106.\n- Efficacy was assessed at Day 106. Success rate was defined as the proportion of subjects achieving “clear” on the Physician’s Lesion Assessment Scale for all 4 treated lesions. Efficacy was also assessed for the proportion of subjects achieving “clear” on the Physician’s Lesion Assessment Scale for at least 3 of 4 lesions\n\n【33】 #How Supplied\n- Hydrogen peroxide topical solution, 40% (w/w) is a clear, colorless solution and is supplied in a unit dose package.

With the exceptions of insulin, exenatide, and pramlintide, all are administered orally and are thus also called oral hypoglycemic agents or oral antihyperglycemic agents.  There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs, and their selection depends on the nature of the diabetes, age and situation of the person, as well as other factors. Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a disease caused by the lack of insulin.  Insulin must be used in Type I, which must be injected or inhaled. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a disease of insulin resistance by cells. Treatments include  agents which increase the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas,  agents which increase the sensitivity of target organs to insulin, and  agents which decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Several groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, are effective in Type II, often in combination. The therapeutic combination in Type II may include insulin, not necessarily because oral agents have failed completely, but in search of a desired combination of effects.  The great advantage of injected insulin in Type II is that a well-educated patient can adjust the dose, or even take additional doses, when blood glucose levels measured by the patient, usually with a simple meter, as needed by the measured amount of sugar in the blood.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that \"manufacturers developing new drugs and biologics for type 2 diabetes provide evidence that the therapy will not increase the risk of such cardiovascular events as a heart attack.\".\n\n【2】 #Oral hypoglycemic agents\nComparative effectiveness of oral agents have been studied with network-meta-analysis.\n\n【3】 #Insulin\nInsulin is usually given subcutaneously, either by injections or by an insulin pump. Research is underway of other routes of administration. In acute care settings, insulin may also be given intravenously. There are several types of insulin, characterized by the rate which they are metabolized by the body.\n\n【4】 #Sulfonylureas\n- Sulfonylureas were the first widely used oral hypoglycemic medications.  They are insulin secretagogues, triggering insulin release by direct action on the KATP channel of the pancreatic beta cells.\n- The \"second-generation\" drugs are now more commonly used.  They are more effective than first-generation drugs and have fewer side effects.\n- They work best with patients over 40 years old, who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years.  They can not be used with type I diabetes, or diabetes of pregnancy.  They can be safely used with metformin or -glitazones.\n\n【5】 #Meglitinides\n- Meglitinides help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called \"short-acting secretagogues.\"\n- Their mode of action is original, affecting potassium channels. By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, hence enhancing insulin secretion.\n- They are taken with meals to boost the insulin response to each meal.\n\n【6】 #Biguanides\n- Biguanides reduce hepatic glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery, including skeletal muscle.\n- Metformin should be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic procedure involving intravenous iodinated contrast as patients are at an increased risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n【7】 #Thiazolidinediones\n- Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also known as \"glitazones,\" bind to PPARγ, a type of nuclear regulatory proteins involved in transcription of genes regulating glucose and fat metabolism.\n- These PPARs act on Peroxysome Proliferator Responsive Elements (PPRE ). The PPREs influence insulin sensitive genes, which enhance production of mRNAs of insulin dependent enzymes. The final result is better use of glucose by the cells.\n- As a result of multiple retrospective studies, there is a concern about rosiglitazone's safety, although it is established that the group, as a whole, has beneficial effects on diabetes. The greatest concern is an increase in the number of severe cardiac events in patients taking it. The ADOPT study showed that initial therapy with drugs of this type may prevent the progression of disease, as did the DREAM trial.\n- In contrast, at least one large prospective study, PROactive 05, has shown that pioglitazone may decrease the overall incidence of cardiac events in people with type II diabetes who have already had a heart attack.\n\n【8】 #Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors are \"diabetes pills\" but not technically hypoglycemic agents because they do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity. These agents slow the digestion of starch in the small intestine, so that glucose from the starch of a meal enters the bloodstream more slowly, and can be matched more effectively by an impaired insulin response or sensitivity.  These agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of impaired glucose tolerance, but can be helpful in combination with other agents in type 2 diabetes.\n- miglitol (Glyset)\n- acarbose (Precose/Glucobay)\nThese medications are rarely used in the United States because of the severity of their side effects (flatulence and bloating).  They are more commonly prescribed in Europe.\nThey do have the potential to cause weight loss by lowering the amount of sugar metabolized.\n\n【9】 #Peptide analogs\nHormones that affect glucose homeostasis and can be pharmacologically manipulated are either produced in the pancreas or gastrointestinal tract\nPancreatic hormones\n- Insulin, produced by beta cells\nAmylin, produced by beta cells;\nGlucagon, produced by alpha cells\nGastrointestinal peptides are incretin mimetics\n- Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)\n- Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide or gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)\n\n【10】 ## Incretin mimetics\nIncretins are insulin secretagogues.  The two main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for being an incretin are Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Gastric inhibitory peptide (aka glucose-dependent Insulinotropic peptide or GIP). Both GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).\n\n【11】 ### Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) analogs\nGLP agonists bind to a membrane GLP receptor. As a consequence of this, insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells is increased.  Endogenous GLP has a half life of only a few minutes; thus an analogue of GLP would not be practical.\nAll are injectable only and include:\n- Short acting exenatide and lixisenatide.\n- Long actiing analogues (more resistant to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)) and include liraglutide, taspoglutide, extended release exenatide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide.\n- Exenatide (also Exendin-4, marketed as Byetta) is the first GLP agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exenatide is not an analogue of GLP, but rather a GLP agonist. Exenatide has only 53% homology with GLP, which increases its resistance to degradation by DPP-4 and extends its half-life.\n- Liraglutide- a once daily human analogue (97% homology) was developed by Novo Nordisk. Liraglutide may delay death and major cardiovascular events.\nThese agents may also cause a decrease in gastric motility, responsible for the common side effect of nausea, and is probably the mechanism by which weight loss occurs.\n\n【12】 ### Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) analogs\n- None are FDA approved\n\n【13】 ## DPP-4 inhibitors\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase blood concentration of the incretin GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) by inhibiting its degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Examples are:\n- Alogliptin\n- vildagliptin\n\n【14】 ### Amylin analogues\nAmylin agonist analogues slow gastric emptying and suppress glucagon.\nAs of 2007, pramlintide is the only clinically available amylin analogue. Like insulin, it is administered by subcutaneous injection. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is nausea, which occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and gradually reduces.\n\n【15】 ### Sodium-glucose transport proteins inhibitor\nSodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2) inhibitor decrease renal glucose reabsorption.\nEmpagliflozin may reduce cardiac events.\nSGLT2 inhibitors may cause necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, or Fournier's gangrene .\n\n【16】 #Experimental agents\nMany other potential drugs are currently in investigation by pharmaceutical companies. Some of these are simply newer members of one of the above classes, but some work by novel mechanisms. For example, at least one compound that enhances the sensitivity of glucokinase to rising glucose is in the stage of animal research. Others are undergoing phase I/II studies.\n- PPARα/γ ligands (muraglitazar and tesaglitazar) - development stopped due to adverse risk profile\n- FBPase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) inhibitors decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver.\n\n【17】 #Herbal extracts\nThe first registered use of anti-diabetic drugs was as herbal extracts used by Indians in the Amazon Basin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and today promoted as vegetable insulin although  not formally an insulin analog.\nThe major recent development was done in Brazil around Myrcia sphaerocarpa and other Myrcia species.\n\"Many countries, especially in the developing world, have a long history of the use of herbal remedies in diabetes (.) STZ diabetic rats were also used to test Myrcia Uniflora extracts (.) \".\nPhytochemical analysis of the Myrcia extracts reported kinds of flavanone glucosides (myrciacitrins) and acetophenone glucosides (myrciaphenones), and inhibitory activities on aldose reductase and alpha-glucosidase.\nA recent review article presents the profiles of plants with hypoglycaemic properties, reported in the literature from 1990 to 2000 and states that \"Medical plants play an important role in the management of diabetes mellitus especially in developing countries where resources are meager.\"", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#17#17#diabetes (.) 和Myrcia Uniflora extracts (.)", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:02:19"}

The identity of the specific trait(s) or condition(s), if any, which would usefully predict a response to ergoloid mesylates therapy is not known. It appears, however, that those individuals who do respond come from groups of patients who would be considered clinically to suffer from some ill-defined process related to aging or to have some underlying dementing condition (i.e. primary progressive dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, senile onset, multi-infarct dementia).\n- Before prescribing ergoloid mesylates, the physician should exclude the possibility that the patient's signs and symptoms arise from a potentially reversible and treatable condition. Particular care should be taken to exclude delirium and dementiform illness secondary to systemic disease, primary neurological disease, or primary disturbance of mood. Ergoloid mesylates preparations are not indicated in the treatment of acute or chronic psychosis, regardless of etiology.\n- 1 mg three times a day.\n- Alleviation of symptoms is usually gradual and results may not be observed for 3–4 weeks.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Dihydroergocristine in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Dihydroergocristine in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Dihydroergocristine in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Dihydroergocristine in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Dihydroergocristine in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Ergoloid mesylates preparations are contraindicated in individuals who have previously shown hypersensitivity to the drug. Ergoloid mesylates preparations are also contraindicated in patients who have psychosis, acute or chronic, regardless of etiology.\n\n【9】 - Practitioners are advised that because the target symptoms are of unknown etiology, careful diagnosis should be attempted before prescribing ergoloid mesylates preparations.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Ergoloid mesylates preparations have not been found to produce serious side effects.\n- Transient nausea and gastric disturbances have been reported. Ergoloid mesylates preparations do not possess the vasoconstrictor properties of the natural ergot alkaloids.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\n- Drug\n- Description\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Dihydroergocristine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Dihydroergocristine during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dihydroergocristine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Dihydroergocristine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n- Description\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- There is no specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism by which ergoloid mesylates preparations produce mental effects, nor is there conclusive evidence that the drug particularly affects cerebral arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular insufficiency.\n\n【29】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in normal volunteers with the help of radiolabelled drug as well as employing a specific radioimmunoassay technique. From the urinary excretion quotient of orally and intravenously administered tritium-labelled ergoloid mesylates the absorption of ergoloid was calculated to be 25%.\n- Following oral administration, peak levels of 0.5 ngEq/mL/mg were achieved within 1.5–3 hr. Bioavailability studies with the specific radioimmunoassay confirm that ergoloid is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with mean peak levels of 0.05–0.13 ng/mL/mg (with extremes of 0.03 and 0.18 ng/mL/mg) achieved within 0.6–1.3 hr (with extremes of 0.4 and 2.8 hr). The finding of lower peak levels of ergoloid compared to the total drug-metabolite composite is consistent with a considerable first pass liver metabolism, with less than 50% of the therapeutic moiety reaching the systemic circulation. The elimination of radioactivity, representing ergoloid plus metabolites bearing the radiolabel, was biphasic with half-lives of 4 and 13 hr. The mean half-life of unchanged ergoloid in plasma is about 2.6–5.1 hr; after 3 half-lives ergoloid plasma levels are less than 10% of radioactivity levels, and by 24 hr no ergoloid is detectable.\n- Bioequivalence studies were performed comparing ergoloid mesylates oral tablets (administered orally) with ergoloid mesylates sublingual tablets (administered sublingually). The oral tablet and sublingual tablet were shown to be bioequivalent.\n\n【31】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【32】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【33】 #How Supplied\n- Ergoloid mesylates tablets, USP (oral) 1 mg are white, round, unscored, debossed MP 20\n\n【34】 ## Storage\nStore at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)\n\n【35】 #Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Dihydroergocristine interaction has not been established.

Common adverse reactions include pain in pelvis, headache, lightheadedness.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Zn-DTPA is indicated for treatment of individuals with known or suspected internal contamination with plutonium, americium, or curium to increase the rates of elimination.\n\n【3】 ### Dosage\n- Chelation treatment is most effective if administered within the first 24 hours after internal contamination and should be started as soon as possible after suspected or known internal contamination. However, even when treatment cannot be started right away, individuals should be given chelation treatment as soon as it becomes available. Chelation treatment is still effective even after time has elapsed following internal contamination, however the chelating effects of Zn-DTPA are greatest when the radiocontaminants are still circulating or are in interstitial fluids. The effectiveness of chelation decreases with time following internal contamination as the radiocontaminants become sequestered in liver and bone.\n- Individuals should drink plenty of fluids and void frequently to promote dilution of the radioactive chelate in the urine and minimize radiation exposure directly to the bladder.\n- If internal contamination with radiocontaminants other than plutonium, americium, or curium, or unknown radiocontaminants is suspected, additional therapies may be needed (e.g. Prussian blue, potassium iodide).\n- Initial Dose\n- IT IS PREFERABLE TO ADMINISTER CA-DTPA, IF AVAILABLE, AS THE INITIAL DOSE DURING THE FIRST 24 HOURS AFTER INTERNAL CONTAMINATION BECAUSE CA-DTPA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ZN-DTPA DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. AFTER 24 HOURS, ZN-DTPA AND CA-DTPA ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE.\n- Adults and Adolescents\n- A single 1.0 gram initial dose of Zn-DTPA administered intravenously.\n- Pediatrics (less than 12 years of age)\n- Renally impaired patients\n- No dose adjustment is needed. However, renal impairment may reduce the rate at which chelators remove radiocontaminants from the body. In heavily contaminated patients with renal impairment, dialysis may be used to increase the rate of elimination. High efficiency high flux dialysis is recommended. Because dialysis fluid will become radioactive, radiation precautions must be taken to protect personnel, other patients, and the general public.\n- Maintenance Treatment\n- The recommended maintenance dose of Zn-DTPA is 1.0 gram once a day administered intravenously.\n- No dose adjustment is needed.\n- The duration of chelation treatment depends on the amount of internal contamination and individual response to treatment.\n- Methods of Administration\n- The intravenous route is recommended and should be used if the route of internal contamination is not known or if multiple routes of internal contamination are likely. Zn-DTPA solution (1 gram in 5 mL) should be administered either with a slow intravenous push over a period of 3-4 minutes or by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes diluted in 100-250 mL of 5% dextrose in water (D5W), Ringers Lactate, or Normal Saline.\n- In individuals whose internal contamination is only by inhalation, Zn-DTPA can be administered by nebulized inhalation as an alternative route of administration. Zn-DTPA should be diluted for nebulization at a 1:1 ratio with sterile water or saline. After nebulization, individuals should be encouraged to avoid swallowing any expectorant. Some individuals may experience respiratory adverse events after inhalation therapy.  The safety and effectiveness of the nebulized route of administration has not been established in the pediatric population.\n- Handling\n- OPC ampoule: to open, turn so that the point faces upward and break off the neck with a downward movement.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The product may be filtered using a sterile filter if particles are seen subsequent to opening of the ampoule.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- None known.\n\n【10】 - Nebulized chelation therapy may be associated with exacerbation of asthma. Caution should be exercised when administering Zn-DTPA by the inhalation route.\n\n【11】 ### Precautions\n- Treatment over several months with Zn-DTPA could lead to depletion of body stores of endogenous metals (e.g. magnesium, manganese). These elements should be monitored routinely and, if appropriate, mineral or vitamin plus mineral supplements should be provided.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- In the U.S. Registry, a total of 646 individuals received at least one dose of either Ca-DTPA or Zn-DTPA. Of these, 62 received Zn-DTPA by one or more routes of administration. Forty-eight individuals were dosed by intravenous administration, 18 by inhalation and 8 by other or unknown routes of administration.\n- Of the individuals that received Zn-DTPA, 23/62 (37%) received one dose and 8 (13%) received two doses. The remaining 31 individuals received three or more doses. The largest number of Zn-DTPA doses to a single individual was 574 doses delivered over 3.5 years.\n- Two individuals experienced cough and/or wheezing with nebulized Ca-DTPA therapy however there was no report of such events with nebulized Zn-DTPA.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\n- Adequate and well-controlled drug-drug interaction studies in humans were not identified in the literature. When an individual is contaminated with multiple radiocontaminants, or when the radiocontaminants are unknown, additional therapies may be needed (e.g. Prussian blue, potassium iodide).\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- Pregnancy Category B\n- There are no human pregnancy outcome data from which to assess the risk of Zn-DTPA exposure on fetal development. Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant mice at doses up to 11.5 mmol/kg (31 times the recommended daily dose of 1 gram based on body surface area  adjusted dose) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There was a slight reduction in the average birth weight.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Studies to determine if Zn-DTPA is excreted in breast milk have not been conducted.\n- Radiocontaminants are known to be excreted in breast milk. Women with known or suspected internal contamination with radiocontaminants should not breast feed, whether or not they are receiving chelation therapy. Precautions should be taken when discarding breast milk\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of Zn-DTPA was established in the adult population and efficacy was extrapolated to the pediatric population for the intravenous route based on the comparability of pathophysiologic mechanisms. The dose is based on body size adjustment for an intravenous drug that is renally cleared. The safety and effectiveness of the nebulized route of administration has not been established in the pediatric population.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\n- Inhalation\n- Intravenous\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\n- Serum electrolytes and essential metals should be closely monitored during Zn-DTPA treatment. Mineral or vitamin plus mineral supplements may be given as appropriate.\n- When possible, obtain baseline blood and urine samples (CBC with differential, BUN, serum chemistries and electrolytes, urinalysis and blood and urine radioassays) before initiating treatment.\n- To establish an elimination curve, a quantitative baseline estimate of the total internalized transuranium element(s) and measures of elimination of radioactivity should be obtained by appropriate whole-body counting, by bioassay (e.g. biodosimetry), or fecal/urine sample whenever possible.\n- During Treatment\n- Measure the radioactivity in blood, urine, and fecal samples weekly to monitor the radioactive contaminant elimination rate.\n- Monitor CBC with differential, BUN, serum chemistries and electrolytes, and urinalysis measurements regularly.\n- Record any adverse events from Zn-DTPA.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\n- Overdose with Zn-DTPA has not been reported.\n\n【30】 #Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Pentetate Zinc Trisodium Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Zn-DTPA forms stable chelates with metal ions by exchanging zinc for a metal of greater binding capacity. The radioactive chelates are then excreted by glomerular filtration into the urine. In animal studies, Zn-DTPA forms less stable chelates with uranium and neptunium in vivo resulting in deposition of these elements in tissues including the bone. Zn-DTPA treatments are not expected to be effective for uranium and neptunium. Radioactive iodine is not bound by DTPA.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Pentetate zinc trisodium injection contains the sodium salt of zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate. Pentetate zinc trisodium is also known as trisodium zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate and is commonly referred to as Zn-DTPA. It has a molecular formula of Na3ZnC14H18N3O10 and a molecular weight of 522.7 Daltons. It is represented by the following structural formula:\n- Zn-DTPA is supplied as a clear, colorless, hyperosmolar (1260 mOsmol/kg) solution in a colorless ampoule containing 5 mL. The ampoule contents are sterile, non-pyrogenic and suitable for intravenous administration. Each mL of solution contains the equivalent of 200 mg pentetate zinc trisodium (obtained from 150.51 mg pentetic acid, 31.14 mg zinc oxide and NaOH) and water for injection, USP. The pH of the solution is adjusted with NaOH and is between 6.5 – 7.5.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In a study of rodents internally contaminated with plutonium, the rate of plutonium elimination was measured after treatment with Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA given intravenously as a single dose of 10 to 1,000 µmol/kg (0.54 – 54 × maximum human dose, MHD). When treated within one hour of internal contamination, Ca-DTPA resulted in about a 10-fold higher rate of elimination of plutonium in the urine as compared to Zn-DTPA. The chelating capacity of Ca-DTPA is greatest immediately and up to approximately 24 hours after internal contamination when the radiocontaminant is still circulating and readily available for chelation. After the first dose of Ca-DTPA, maintenance treatment with either Ca-DTPA or Zn-DTPA resulted in similar rates of elimination of radioactivity. However, at comparable doses, Zn-DTPA had less toxicity (e.g. less depletion of trace metals, lower rate of mortality, the absence of kidney and liver vacuolization, and absence of small bowel hemorrhagic lesions).\n- In another study, rodents contaminated with aerosolized plutonium and americium were treated with Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA. The treatment schedule involved inhalation of Ca-DTPA 2 µmol/kg (0.11 MHD) 30 minutes after contamination followed by inhalation of Zn-DTPA 2 µmol/kg at approximately 6 hours, 1, 2, 3, and 6 days, then twice weekly to day 26 or day 27. The treatment regime reduced the lung deposit of plutonium and americium to 1-2% of that in untreated animals. Systemic deposit in liver and skeleton were reduced by half.\n- Literature and U.S. Registry data in humans indicate that intravenous administration of Zn-DTPA forms chelates with radioactive contaminants found in the circulation, interstitial fluid, and tissues. When Zn-DTPA is administered by inhalation, it can chelate transuranium elements. Expectoration is expected to decrease the amount of radioactive contaminant available for systemic absorption.\n- The effectiveness of chelation decreases with time after internal contamination because the transuranium elements become incorporated into the tissues. Chelation treatment should be given as soon as possible after known or suspected internal contamination with transuranium elements has occurre\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Plasma retention and urinary excretion data were obtained in 2 subjects that received 750 kBq of 14C-DTPA The plasma retention up to 7 hours post dosing was expressed by the sum of three exponential components with average half-lives of 1.4 min, 14.5 min, and 94.4 min. The level of activity in the plasma was below the limit of detection 24 hours after injection. During the study, no detectable activity was exhaled or excreted in the feces. By 24 hours, cumulative urinary excretion was more than 99% of the injected dose\n- Absorption\n- Zn-DTPA is poorly absorbed in the GI tract. In animal studies, after oral administration, absorption was approximately 5%. In a U.S. Registry of 18 patients who received a single inhaled or intravenous dose of 1 gram, urine data indicate that the inhaled product was absorbed and resulted in a comparable elimination of the radiocontaminant. One study of 2 human subjects that received Ca-DTPA with 14C-DTPA by inhalation revealed approximately 20% absorption from the lungs. Human or animal bioavailability comparisons for Zn-DTPA are not available after administration by inhalation and intravenous injection.\n- Distribution\n- Following intravenous administration, Zn-DTPA is rapidly distributed throughout the extracellular fluid space. No significant amount of Zn-DTPA penetrates into erythrocytes or other cells. No accumulation of Zn-DTPA in specific organs has been observed. There is little or no binding of the chelating agent by the renal parenchyma.\n- Metabolism\n- Zn-DTPA undergoes a minimal amount of metabolic change in the body.\n- Adverse Metabolic Effects\n- Elimination\n- Zn-DTPA is cleared from the plasma in the first few hours after dosing through urinary excretion by glomerular filtration. Renal tubular excretion has not been documented. In stool samples, only a very small amount of radioactivity (<3%) was detected.\n- Renal Impaired and/or Compromised Liver Function Patients\n- Adequate and well-controlled pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in renally impaired and/or hepatically impaired patients were not identified in the literature. Both Zn-DTPA and its radioactive chelates are excreted by glomerular filtration. Impaired renal function may decrease their rates of elimination and increase the serum half-life of Zn-DTPA.\n- Clinical trials\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Studies with Zn-DTPA to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility have not been performed. Data for Zn-DTPA effects on spermatogenesis are not available\n\n【36】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Pentetate Zinc Trisodium in the drug label.\n\n【37】 #How Supplied\n- Zn-DTPA is supplied as a sterile solution in 5 mL single-use clear glass ampoules at a concentration of 200 mg/mL for intravenous use.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n- Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below:\n- Septicemia in the pediatric patient and adult caused by P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp\n- Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, E. coli, and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains)\n- Serious central nervous system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms.\n- Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella spp, and Enterobacter spp\n- Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and S. aureus\n- Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use.\n- Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above.\n\n【3】 ### Dosing Information\n- Tobramycin may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations.\n- Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours,\n- Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses . The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored.\n- Pediatric Patients (greater than 1 week of age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours).\n- Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours.\n- It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days.\n- Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy.\n- Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary.\n- Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed.\n\n【4】 - Tobramycin may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial.\n- For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL.\n- Prior to the administration, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【5】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Tobramycin (Injection) in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Tobramycin (Injection) in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Tobramycin (Injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Tobramycin (Injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\n- A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class.\n\n【11】 - Tobramycin injection contains sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.\n- Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported.\n- If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.\n\n【12】 ### General\n- Prescribing tobramycin injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n- Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored.\n- Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment.\n- A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3 to 4 day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.\n- In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage.\n- Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts.\n- Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated.\n- Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients.\n- An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins.\n- Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function.\n- Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.\n\n【13】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential.\n- Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function.\n\n【14】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【15】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【16】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Tobramycin (Injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【17】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Tobramycin (Injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【18】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in women who are nursing.\n\n【19】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in pediatric settings.\n\n【20】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin . Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels . Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function . Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly .\n- Tobramycin 80 mg/2mL vial contains 1.568 mg (0.0682 mEq) of sodium.\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【22】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【23】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【26】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Tobramycin (Injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【27】 ### Administration\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Administration in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Tobramycin (Injection) and IV administrations.\n\n【30】 #Overdosage\n- The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, in pediatric patients given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or in patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted.\n- Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued.\n- Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.\n- If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract.\n- The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs.\n- Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and who have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL.\n- Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis in bacterial cells.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius. Tobramycin Injection USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration.\n- Tobramycin sulfate is O-3-amino-3-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1>4)-O--2-deoxy-L-streptamine sulfate (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C18H37N5O9)25H2SO4. The molecular weight is 1,425.45. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows:\n\n【33】 ### Microbiology\n- Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal.\n- Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms\n- Staphylococcus aureus\n- Citrobacter species\n- Escherichia coli\n- Klebsiella species\n- Morganella morganii\n- Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Proteus mirabilis - Providencia species\n- Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci.\n- Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis. However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium. Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized.\n- Cross resistance between aminoglycosides may occur.\n\n【34】 ### Susceptibility Tests\n- Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One such procedure is the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) approved procedure1. This method has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility to tobramycin. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameters obtained in the disk test with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tobramycin.\n- Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 10 mcg tobramycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n- Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. The 10 mcg tobramycin disk should give the following zone diameters:\n- Broth and agar dilution methods, such as those recommended by the NCCLS2, may be used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tobramycin. MIC test results should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n- As with standard diffusion methods, dilution procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. Tobramycin Laboratory reagent should give the following MIC values:\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin injection is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.\n- In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function, and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly .\n- Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours.\n- Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Tobramycin (Injection) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\nTobramycin Injection USP - 40 mg/mL, in multidose vials, is supplied as follows:\n\n【39】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20° to 25° C (68° to 77°F) .\n\n【40】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n80 mg\n\n【41】 2 mL Multi-Dose Vial tobramycin injection USP\nSterile\nFor IM or IV Use.\nMust dilute for IV use.\nRx only\n\n【42】 (2 mL each)\ninjection USP\nPfizer Injectables\n1.2 g\n\n【43】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When tobramycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may  decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and  increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n\n【44】 #Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Tobramycin (Injection) interaction has not been established.

Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\nThere are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g. lowering HDL, raising LDL) and impairment of glucose tolerance.\n\n【3】 ## Elevated blood pressure\nIn a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.\n\n【4】 ## Hypertriglyceridemia\nIn patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. In the HOPE\nstudy, the mean percent increase from baseline in serum triglycerides after one year of treatment with Premarin 0.625 mg/2.5 mg, 0.45 mg/1.5 mg, and 0.3 mg/1.5 mg compared with placebo were 32.8, 24.8, 23.3, and 10.7, respectively. After two years of treatment, the mean percent changes were 33.0, 17.1, 21.6, and 5.5, respectively.\n\n【5】 ## Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice\nEstrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.\n\n【6】 ## Hypothyroidism\nEstrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n【7】 ## Fluid retention\nBecause estrogens/progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful\n-bservation when estrogens are prescribed.\n\n【8】 ## Hypocalcemia\nEstrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia\n\n【9】 ## Ovarian cancer\nUse of estrogen-only products, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer in some epidemiological studies. Other studies did not show a significant association. Data are insufficient to determine whether there is an increased risk with combined estrogen/progestin therapy in postmenopausal women.\n\n【10】 ## Exacerbation of endometriosis\nEndometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens.\n\n【11】 ## Exacerbation of other conditions\nEstrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#4#4#study, the mean percent increase from...与上面的In the HOPE是一句话", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:41:25"}

Hypopharyngeal cancer commonly affects patients in 55 to 65 years of age. Males are mostly affected with a hypopharyngeal cancer compare to women. Hypopharyngeal cancer comprises about 7% of all cancers of the head and neck. According to the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, screening test for hypopharyngeal cancer is not recommended.The majority of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer are initially asymptomatic. Most patients with hypopharyngeal cancer clinically manisfest symptoms at a late stage (III and IV) because of the tumor aggression which metastasizes to lymph nodes and submucosa. Once the tumor has expanded from its original site, it may obstruct the aerodigestive tract. Most common clinical presentations are neck mass, dysphagia with weight loss, non healing sore throat, odynophagia, and hoarseness. Common complications of hypopharyngeal cancer include upper airway obstruction and disfigurement of the neck or face. The prognosis varies with the type of hypopharyngeal cancer.

The available surgery options are transoral laser surgery, total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy surgery, total laryngectomy and circumferential pharyngectomy.\n\n【2】 #Historical Prospective\nHypopharyngeal Cancer is a rare type of malignant tumor. Hypopharyngeal cancer was discovered by Harrisson in 1970 with more than half in the postcricoid part.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nHypopharyngeal cancer may be classified according to the location into 4 subtypes: pyriform sinus cancer, postcricoid area cancer, and posterior wall of hypopharynx cancer. A pyriform sinus cancer subtype is found in 60 to 85 percent of patients who are diagnosed with hypopharyngeal cancer. Hypopharyngeal cancer may also be classified based on the histopathology.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nOn microscopic histopathological analysis, spindle cells, basaloid cells, and nuclear atypia are the characteristic findings of hypopharyngeal cancer.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nThere are no direct causes for hypopharngeal cancer however, there are some common risk factors that may lead to gene mutations and cause the hypopharyngeal cancer. Common risk factors for hypopharyngeal cancer can be found here.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Hypopharyngeal Cancer from other Diseases\nHypopharyngeal carcinoma must be differentiated from accessory salivary gland tumor, lymphoma, and retropharyngeal abscess.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe prevalence of hypopharyngeal cancer is estimated to be 2,500 new cases annually in U.S and hypopharyngeal cancer is a very rare type of cancer. Hypopharyngeal cancer commonly affects patients in 55 to 65 years of age. Males are mostly affected with a hypopharyngeal cancer compare to women. Hypopharyngeal cancer comprises about 7% of all cancers of the head and neck.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of hypopharyngeal cancer are tobacco use, and abuse of alcohol consumption.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, screening test for hypopharyngeal cancer is not recommended.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe majority of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer are initially asymptomatic. Most patients with hypopharyngeal cancer clinically manisfest symptoms at late stage (III and IV) because of the tumor aggression which metastasizes to lymph nodes and submucosa. Once the tumor has expanded from its site of origin, it may obstruct the aerodigestive tract. Most common clinical presentations are neck mass, dysphagia with weight loss, non healing sore throat, odynophagia, and hoarseness. Common complications of hypopharyngeal cancer include upper airway obstruction and disfigurement of the neck or face. The prognosis varies with the type of hypopharyngeal cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma of hypopharynx has poor prognosis and small survival rate.\n\n【11】 #Diagnostic Study of Choice and Staging\nThe diagnostic study of choice for hypopharyngeal cancer is CT scan with contrast of head and neck. The definitive diagnosis of hypopharyngeal cancer is biopsy of the tumor.\n\n【12】 #History and Symptoms\nThe hallmark of hypopharyngeal cancer is dysphagia. A positive history of odynophagia and hoarseness is suggestive of hypopharyngeal cancer. Common symptoms include a lump in the neck, dysphagia, chronic sore throat and hoarseness.\n\n【13】 #Physical Examination\nPatients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma are usually well appearing. Physical examination of the patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma is usually remarkable for the neck swelling.\n\n【14】 #Laboratory Findings\nThere are no diagnostic laboratory findings associated with hypopharyngeal cancer.\n\n【15】 #Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with hypopharyngeal cancer.\n\n【16】 #Chest X Ray\nChest X rays may be performed to detect metastasis of hypopharyngeal cancer to the lungs.\n\n【17】 #CT\nHead and neck CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of hypopharyngeal cancer. Findings on CT scan suggestive of hypopharyngeal cancer include soft tissue mass, irregular thickening of the mucosa, and necrotic region which is a sign of metastasis.\n\n【18】 #MRI\nMRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of hypopharyngeal cancer. Findings on the MRI suggestive of hypopharyneal cancer include tumors are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 for soft tissues.\n\n【19】 #Other Imaging Findings\nUltrasound may be helpful to assess hypopharyngeal cancer along with endoscopy. Ultrasound may be use to detect, and localize primary tumors that invade neighboring organs such as esophagus, thyroid gland, and postcricoid area.\n\n【20】 #Other Diagnostic Studies\nBiopsy may be diagnostic of hypopharyngeal cancer. Findings on biopsy diagnostic of hypopharyngeal cancer include spindle cells, basaloid cells, and nuclear atypia.\n\n【21】 #Medical Therapy\nThe medical therapy with the combination of the radiotherapy has been used compared to surgical therapy for the treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer.The optimal therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer depends on the stage at the time of the diagnosis. The combined treatment helps with organ preservation. Swallowing, speech and laryngeal preservation are important to consider during the treatment.\n\n【22】 #Surgery\nThe feasibility of surgery depends on the stage of hypopharyngeal cancer at the time of diagnosis. The main goal of the surgery is to clear any margin that contains  tumor cells. The available surgery options are transoral laser surgery, total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy surgery, total laryngectomy and circumferential pharyngectomy.\n\n【23】 #Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of hypopharyngeal cancer include smoking cessation, decrease alcohol consumption, increase vegetables and fruits consumption, and vaccination for HPV.\n\n【24】 #Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention measures of hypopharyngeal cancer include routine physical examination of head and neck and thyroid Screening are recommended among the patients who had received radiation therapy to the head and neck regions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-28 00:28:21"}

Alternative splicing of exon 5 gives rise to two alternate exons. The promoter has been identified 2.5 kilobase pairs (kb) upstream of the transcription start site, and the 5’- untranslated exons may enhance expression of the SCN1A gene in SH-SY5Y cells, a human cell line derived from a neuroblastoma.\nThe SCN1A gene codes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel making it a member of ten paralogous gene families which code for the voltage-gated sodium transmembrane proteins NaV1.1. Within the family of genes which code for other portions of voltage-gated sodium channels, the SCN1A mutations were the first identified, since mutations to this gene caused epilepsy and febrile seizures. Indeed, the SCN1A gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in the human genome associated with epilepsy, which has given it the title of a ‘super culprit gene’. There are 900 distinct mutations reported for the SCN1A gene, approximately half of the reported mutations are truncations which result in no protein. The remaining half of mutations are missense mutations, which are predicted to either cause loss-of-function or gain-of-function, though very few have been tested for functionality in the lab.\nSubtle differences in voltage-gated sodium ion channels can have devastating physiological effects and underlie abnormal neurological functioning. Mutations to the SCN1A gene most often results in different forms of seizure disorders, the most common forms of seizure disorders are Dravet Syndrome (DS), Intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICEGTC), and severe myoclonic epilepsy borderline (SMEB). Clinically, 70-80% of patients with DS have identified mutations specific to the SCN1A gene, which are caused by de novo heterozygous mutations of the SCN1A gene There are currently two databases on SCN1A mutations, Infobase and the SCN1A variant database.\nMice with knock-in SCN1A mutations, who are model organisms for DS quickly develop seizures, indicative of a significant reduction in the function of NaV1.1. It has been hypothesized that reduced sodium currents due to NaV1.1 mutations may cause hyper-excitability in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons leading to epilepsy. Mice in both the homozygous and heterozygous states develop the seizure phenotype and ataxia. Though homozygous mice die on average during the second to third week of life and approximately 50% of heterozygous null mice survive into adulthood.\n- From a gene symbol: This is a redirect from a Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) symbol for a gene to an article about the gene.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:21:42"}

It produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution; specifically by guanine alkylation.  This typically produces only point mutations.  It can induce mutations at a rate of 5x10-4 to 5x10-2 per gene without substantial killing.  The ethyl group of EMS reacts with guanine in DNA, forming the abnormal base O-6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases that catalyze the process frequently place thymine, instead of cytosine, opposite O-6-ethylguanine. Following subsequent rounds of replication, the original G:C base pair can become an A:T pair. This changes the genetic information, is often harmful to cells, and can result in disease. Many mutagens cause a wide variety of cancers in humans.\nEMS is often used in genetics as a mutagen. Mutations induced by EMS can then be studied in genetic screens or other assays.\n\n【2】 #Popular culture\nIn the 1982 movie Blade Runner, replicant Roy Batty asks Dr. Eldon Tyrell about the possibility of extending his preprogrammed lifespan by changing his genetic code with \"EMS recombination\"\"", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#2#2# “EMS recombination”\"  里面的\" ", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:08:57"}

Flecainide acetate is benzamide, N-(2-piperidinylmethyl)-2,5-bis -monoacetate. Its molecular formula is C17H20F6N2O3C2H4O2, and its molecular weight is 474.39. The structural formula is given below.\nFlecainide acetate is a white crystalline substance with a pKa of 9.3. It has an aqueous solubility of 48.4 mg/mL at 37°C.\n\n【3】 #Clinical Pharmacology\nFlecainide has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics.\n\n【4】 ## Electrophysiology\nIn man, Flecainide produces a dose-related decrease in intracardiac conduction in all parts of the heart with the greatest effect on the His-Purkinje system (H-V conduction). Effects upon atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time and intra-atrial conduction times, although present, are less pronounced than those on ventricular conduction velocity. Significant effects on refractory periods were observed only in the ventricle. Sinus node recovery times (corrected) following pacing and spontaneous cycle lengths are somewhat increased. This latter effect may become significant in patients with sinus node dysfunction.\nFlecainide causes a dose-related and plasma-level related decrease in single and multiple PVCs and can suppress recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. In limited studies of patients with a history of ventricular tachycardia, Flecainide has been successful 30 to 40% of the time in fully suppressing the inducibility of arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation. Based on PVC suppression, it appears that plasma levels of 0.2 to 1 mcg/mL may be needed to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. It is more difficult to assess the dose needed to suppress serious arrhythmias, but trough plasma levels in patients successfully treated for recurrent ventricular tachycardia were between 0.2 and 1 mcg/mL. Plasma levels above 0.7 - 1 mcg/mL are associated with a higher rate of cardiac adverse experiences such as conduction defects or bradycardia. The relation of plasma levels to proarrhythmic events is not established, but dose reduction in clinical trials of patients with ventricular tachycardia appears to have led to a reduced frequency and severity of such events.\n\n【5】 ## Hemodynamics\nFlecainide does not usually alter heart rate, although bradycardia and tachycardia have been reported occasionally.\nIn animals and isolated myocardium, a negative inotropic effect of Flecainide has been demonstrated. Decreases in ejection fraction, consistent with a negative inotropic effect, have been observed after single administration of 200 to 250 mg of the drug in man; both increases and decreases in ejection fraction have been encountered during multidose therapy in patients at usual therapeutic doses.\n\n【6】 ## Metabolism in Humans\nFollowing oral administration, the absorption of Flecainide is nearly complete. Peak plasma levels are attained at about three hours in most individuals (range, 1 to 6 hours). Flecainide does not undergo any consequential presystemic biotransformation (first-pass effect). Food or antacid do not affect absorption. Milk, however, may inhibit absorption in infants. A reduction in Flecainide dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet of infants.\nThe apparent plasma half-life averages about 20 hours and is quite variable (range, 12 to 27 hours) after multiple oral doses in patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). With multiple dosing, plasma levels increase because of its long half-life with steady-state levels approached in 3 to 5 days; once at steady-state, no additional (or unexpected) accumulation of drug in plasma occurs during chronic therapy. Over the usual therapeutic range, data suggest that plasma levels in an individual are approximately proportional to dose, deviating upwards from linearity only slightly (about 10 to 15% per 100 mg on average).\nIn healthy subjects, about 30% of a single oral dose (range, 10 to 50%) is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The two major urinary metabolites are meta-O-dealkylated Flecainide (active, but about one-fifth as potent) and the meta-O-dealkylated lactam of Flecainide (non-active metabolite). These two metabolites (primarily conjugated) account for most of the remaining portion of the dose. Several minor metabolites (3% of the dose or less) are also found in urine; only 5% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. In patients, free (unconjugated) plasma levels of the two major metabolites are very low (less than 0.05 mcg/mL).\nIn vitro metabolic studies have confirmed that cytochrome P450IID6 is involved in the metabolism in Flecainide.\nWhen urinary pH is very alkaline (8 or higher), as may occur in rare conditions (e.g. renal tubular acidosis, strict vegetarian diet), Flecainide elimination from plasma is much slower.\nIn patients with NYHA class III congestive heart failure (CHF), the rate of Flecainide elimination from plasma (mean half-life, 19 hours) is moderately slower than for healthy subjects (mean half-life, 14 hours), but similar to the rate for patients with PVCs without CHF. The extent of excretion of unchanged drug in urine is also similar.\nUnder one year of age, currently available data are limited but suggest that the half-life at birth may be as long as 29 hours, decreasing to 11 to 12 hours by three months of age and 6 hours by one year of age. The pharmacokinetics in hydropic infants have not been studied, but case reports suggest prolonged elimination. In children aged 1 year to 12 years the half-life is approximately 8 hours. In adolescents (age 12 to 15) the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 11 to 12 hours. Since milk may inhibit absorption in infants, a reduction in Flecainide dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet (e.g. gastroenteritis, weaning). Plasma trough Flecainide levels should be monitored during major changes in dietary milk intake.\nFrom age 20 to 80, plasma levels are only slightly higher with advancing age; Flecainide elimination from plasma is somewhat slower in elderly subjects than in younger subjects. Patients up to age 80+ have been safely treated with usual dosages.\nThe extent of Flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is about 40% and is independent of plasma drug level over the range of 0.015 to about 3.4 mcg/mL. Thus, clinically significant drug interactions based on protein binding effects would not be expected.\nHemodialysis removes only about 1% of an oral dose as unchanged Flecainide.\nSmall increases in plasma digoxin levels are seen during coadministration of Flecainide with digoxin. Small increases in both Flecainide and propranolol plasma levels are seen during coadministration of these two drugs.\n\n【7】 #Clinical Trials\nIn two randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks double-blind duration, 79% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) receiving Flecainide were attack free, whereas 15% of patients receiving placebo remained attack free. The median time-before-recurrence of PSVT in patients receiving placebo was 11 to 12 days, whereas over 85% of patients receiving Flecainide had no recurrence at 60 days.\n\n【8】 #Indications and Usage for Flecainide\nIn patients without structural heart disease, Flecainide is indicated for the prevention of:\n- paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), including atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and other supraventricular tachycardias of unspecified mechanism associated with disabling symptoms\n- paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms\nFlecainide is also indicated for the prevention of:\n- documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (sustained VT), that in the judgment of the physician are life threatening.\nUse of Flecainide for the treatment of sustained VT, like other antiarrhythmics, should be initiated in the hospital. The use of Flecainide is not recommended in patients with less severe ventricular arrhythmias even if the patients are symptomatic.\nBecause of the proarrhythmic effects of Flecainide, its use should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.\nUse of Flecainide in chronic atrial fibrillation has not been adequately studied and is not recommended.\nAs is the case for other antiarrhythmic agents, there is no evidence from controlled trials that the use of Flecainide favorably affects survival or the incidence of sudden death.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\nFlecainide is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing second- or third-degree AV block, or with right bundle branch block when associated with a left hemiblock (bifascicular block), unless a pacemaker is present to sustain the cardiac rhythm should complete heart block occur. Flecainide is also contraindicated in the presence of cardiogenic shock or known hypersensitivity to the drug.\n\n【10】 Mortality–Flecainide was included in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long term, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had a myocardial infarction more than six days but less than two years previously. An excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in patients treated with Flecainide compared with that seen in patients assigned to a carefully matched placebo-treated group. This rate was 16/315 (5.1%) for Flecainide and 7/309 (2.3%) for the matched placebo. The average duration of treatment with Flecainide in this study was ten months.\nThe applicability of the CAST results to other populations (e.g. those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain, but at present, it is prudent to consider the risks of Class IC agents (including Flecainide), coupled with the lack of any evidence of improved survival, generally unacceptable in patients without life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not life-threatening, symptoms or signs.\nVentricular Pro-arrhythmic Effects in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter. A review of the world literature revealed reports of 568 patients treated with oral Flecainide for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF). Ventricular tachycardia was experienced in 0.4% (2/568) of these patients. Of 19 patients in the literature with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), 10.5%  experienced VT or VF. Flecainide IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. Case reports of ventricular proarrhythmic effects in patients treated with Flecainide for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased PVCs, VT, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and death.\nAs with other Class I agents, patients treated with Flecainide for atrial flutter have been reported with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction due to slowing the atrial rate. A paradoxical increase in the ventricular rate also may occur in patients with atrial fibrillation who receive Flecainide. Concomitant negative chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.\n\n【11】 #PROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS\nFlecainide, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g. tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with Flecainide, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs ornewsupraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with Flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of Flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.\nIt is uncertain if Flecainide’s risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.\nIn patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient’s underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.\nAmong patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule.\nThe relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital.\n\n【12】 #HEART FAILURE\nFlecainide has a negative inotropic effect and may cause or worsen CHF, particularly inpatients with cardiomyopathy, preexisting severe heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV) or low ejection fractions (less than 30%). In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias new or worsened CHF developed in 0.4% (1/225) of patients. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia during a mean duration of 7.9 months of Flecainide therapy, 6.3% (20/317) developed new CHF. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of CHF, during a mean duration of 5.4 months of Flecainide therapy, 25.7% (78/304) developed worsened CHF. Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. Flecainide should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with Flecainide, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on Flecainide can continue on Flecainide with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of Flecainide. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma Flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1 mcg/mL.\n\n【13】 #Effects on Cardiac Conduction\nFlecainide slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.2 seconds). The QRS complex increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop QRS complexes with a duration of 12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new bundle branch block while on Flecainide. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.3 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia associated with Flecainide therapy.\nClinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction such as sinus pause, sinus arrest and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%), second-degree AV block (0.5%) and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose in an effort to minimize these effects. If second- or third-degree AV block, or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occur, Flecainide therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.\n\n【14】 ## Sick Sinus Syndrome (Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome)\nFlecainide should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest.\n\n【15】 ## Effects on Pacemaker Thresholds\nFlecainide is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if Flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.\nThe pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with Flecainide, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.\n\n【16】 #Electrolyte Disturbances\nHypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of Flecainide.\n\n【17】 #Pediatric Use\nThe safety and efficacy of Flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of Flecainide, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, Flecainide has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of Flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children.\n\n【18】 ## Drug Interactions\nFlecainide has been administered to patients receiving digitalis preparations or beta-adrenergic blocking agents without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of Flecainide to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of digoxin, a 13% to 19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours post dose.\nIn a study involving healthy subjects receiving Flecainide and propranolol concurrently, plasma Flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, Flecainide and propranolol were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of Flecainide and propranolol on the PR interval were less than additive. In Flecainide clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and Flecainide should be recognized.\nFlecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of Flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g. anticoagulants) would not be expected. Flecainide has been used in a large number of patients receiving diuretics without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of Flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving cimetidine (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma Flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.\nWhen amiodarone is added to Flecainide therapy, plasma Flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if Flecainide dosage is not reduced.\nDrugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of Flecainide in patients that are on chronic Flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.\nThere has been little experience with the coadministration of Flecainide and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with Flecainide are unknown, neither disopyramide nor verapamil should be administered concurrently with Flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of Flecainide with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.\n\n【19】 #Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nLong-term studies with Flecainide in rats and mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day have not revealed any compound-related carcinogenic effects. Mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse lymphoma and in vivo cytogenetics) did not reveal any mutagenic effects. A rat reproduction study at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (seven times the usual human dose) did not reveal any adverse effect on male or female fertility.\n\n【20】 ## Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category C.\nFlecainide has been shown to have teratogenic effects (club paws, sternebrae and vertebrae abnormalities, pale hearts with contracted ventricular septum) and an embryotoxic effect (increased resorptions) in one breed of rabbit (New Zealand White) when given doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg/day, but not in another breed of rabbit (Dutch Belted) when given doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and mice given doses up to 50 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively; however, delayed sternebral and vertebral ossification was observed at the high dose in rats. Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, Flecainide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\n【21】 ## Labor and Delivery\nIt is not known whether the use of Flecainide during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the mother or fetus, affects the duration of labor or delivery, or increases the possibility of forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention.\n\n【22】 ## Nursing Mothers\nResults from a multiple dose study conducted in mothers soon after delivery indicates that Flecainide is excreted in human breast milk in concentrations as high as 4 times (with average levels about 2.5 times) corresponding plasma levels; assuming a maternal plasma level at the top of the therapeutic range (1 mcg/mL), the calculated daily dose to a nursing infant (assuming about 700 mL breast milk over 24 hours) would be less than 3 mg.\n\n【23】 #Pediatric Use\nThe safety and efficacy of Flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n【24】 #Hepatic Impairment\nSince Flecainide elimination from plasma can be markedly slower in patients with significant hepatic impairment, Flecainide should not be used in such patients unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If used, frequent and early plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage; dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days).\n\n【25】 #Adverse Reactions\nIn post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic PVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, Flecainide therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group.\nIn patients treated with Flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some patients, Flecainide treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest).  New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297 patients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients have developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether . The frequency of most of these serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1 mcg/mL.\nThere have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and isolated elevations of serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic and no cause and effect relationship with Flecainide has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare reports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and hepatic failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias. Although no cause and effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue Flecainide in patients who develop unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias in order to eliminate Flecainide as the possible causative agent.\nIncidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with ventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration to 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial, 5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects.\n- Most Common Non-Cardiac Adverse Effects in Ventricular Arrhythmia Patients Treated with Flecainide in the Multicenter Study\n- Dizziness\n- Visual Disturbances\n- Dyspnea - Headache\n- Nausea - Fatigue\n- Palpitation\n- Chest Pain\n- Tremor - Edema - Abdominal Pain\nThe following additional adverse experiences, possibly related to Flecainide therapy and occurring in 1% to less than 3% of patients, have been reported in acute and chronic studies:\n- Body as a Whole\n- malaise\n- fever\n- Cardiovascular\n- tachycardia - sinus pause or arrest\n- Gastrointestinal\n- vomiting\n- diarrhea - anorexia - Skin\n- rash\n- diplopia - Nervous System\n- hypoesthesia - flushing\n- increased sweating\n- vertigo\n- somnolence\n- tinnitus\n- Psychiatric\n- insomnia - depression\n- swollen lips, - tongue and mouth\n- arthralgia, - bronchospasm, - angina pectoris, - second-degree and third-degree AV block, - bradycardia, - flatulence;\n- Urinary System\n- polyuria, - urinary retention;\n- Hematologic\n- granulocytopenia, - thrombocytopenia;\n- exfoliative dermatitis, - pruritus, - eye pain or irritation, - photophobia, - nystagmus;\n- twitching, - weakness, - change in taste, - dry mouth, - convulsions, - impotence, - speech disorder, - neuropathy;\n- Respiratory\n- pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltration possibly due to chronic Flecainide treatment:\n- morbid dreams,\nFor patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, the most commonly reported noncardiac adverse experiences remain consistent with those known for patients treated with Flecainide for ventricular arrhythmias. Dizziness is possibly more frequent in PAF patients.\n\n【26】 #Overdosage\nNo specific antidote has been identified for the treatment of Flecainide overdosage. Overdoses ranging up to 8000 mg have been survived, with peak plasma Flecainide concentrations as high as 5.3 mcg/mL. Untoward effects in these cases included nausea and vomiting, convulsions, hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, extreme widening of the QRS complex, widening of the QT interval, widening of the PR interval, ventricular tachycardia, AV nodal block, asystole, bundle branch block, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest. The spectrum of events observed in fatal cases was much the same as that seen in the non-fatal cases. Death has resulted following ingestion of as little as 1000 mg; concomitant overdose of other drugs and/or alcohol in many instances undoubtedly contributed to the fatal outcome. Treatment of overdosage should be supportive and may include the following: removal of unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract, administration of inotropic agents or cardiac stimulants such as dopamine, dobutamine or isoproterenol; mechanically assisted respiration; circulatory assists such as intra-aortic balloon pumping; and transvenous pacing in the event of conduction block.\nBecause of the long plasma half-life of Flecainide (12 to 27 hours in patients receiving usual doses), and the possibility of markedly non-linear elimination kinetics at very high doses, these supportive treatments may need to be continued for extended periods of time.\nHemodialysis is not an effective means of removing Flecainide from the body. Since Flecainide elimination is much slower when urine is very alkaline (pH 8 or higher), theoretically, acidification of urine to promote drug excretion may be beneficial in overdose cases with very alkaline urine. There is no evidence that acidification from normal urinary pH increases excretion.\n\n【27】 #Flecainide Dosage and Administration\nFor patients with sustained VT, no matter what their cardiac status, Flecainide, like other antiarrhythmics, should be initiated in-hospital with rhythm monitoring.\nFlecainide has a long half-life (12 to 27 hours in patients). Steady-state plasma levels, in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, may not be achieved until the patient has received 3 to 5 days of therapy at a given dose. Therefore, increases in dosage should be made no more frequently than once every four days, since during the first 2 to 3 days of therapy the optimal effect of a given dose may not be achieved.\nFor patients with PSVT and patients with PAF the recommended starting dose is 50 mg every 12 hours. Flecainide acetate doses may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved. For PAF patients, a substantial increase in efficacy without a substantial increase in discontinuations for adverse experiences may be achieved by increasing the Flecainide dose from 50 mg to 100 mg bid. The maximum recommended dose for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias is 300 mg/day.\nFor sustained VT the recommended starting dose is 100 mg every 12 hours. This dose may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved. Most patients with sustained VT do not require more than 150 mg every 12 hours (300 mg/day), and the maximum dose recommended is 400 mg/day.\nIn patients with sustained VT, use of higher initial doses and more rapid dosage adjustments have resulted in an increased incidence of proarrhythmic events and CHF, particularly during the first few days of dosing . Therefore, a loading dose is not recommended.\nIntravenous lidocaine has been used occasionally with Flecainide while awaiting the therapeutic effect of Flecainide. No adverse drug interactions were apparent. However, no formal studies have been performed to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen.\nAn occasional patient not adequately controlled by (or intolerant to) a dose given at 12-hour intervals may be dosed at eight-hour intervals.\nOnce adequate control of the arrhythmia has been achieved, it may be possible in some patients to reduce the dose as necessary to minimize side effects or effects on conduction. In such patients, efficacy at the lower dose should be evaluated.\nFlecainide should be used cautiously in patients with a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction .\nAny use of Flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children. Because of the evolving nature of information in this area, specialized literature should be consulted. Under six months of age, the initial starting dose of Flecainide in children is approximately 50 mg/M2 body surface area daily, divided into two or three equally spaced doses. Over six months of age, the initial starting dose maybe increased to 100 mg/M2 per day. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg/M2 per day. This dose should not be exceeded. In some children on higher doses, despite previously low plasma levels, the level has increased rapidly to far above therapeutic values while taking the same dose. Small changes in dose may also lead to disproportionate increases in plasma levels. Plasma trough (less than one hour pre-dose) Flecainide levels and electrocardiograms should be obtained at presumed steady state (after at least five doses) either after initiation or change in Flecainide dose, whether the dose was increased for lack of effectiveness, or increased growth of the patient. For the first year on therapy, whenever the patient is seen for reasons of clinical follow-up, it is suggested that a 12-lead electrocardiogram and plasma trough Flecainide level are obtained. The usual therapeutic level of Flecainide in children is 200 to 500 ng/mL. In some cases, levels as high as 800 ng/mL may be required for control.\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 35 mL/min/1.73 square meters or less), the initial dosage should be 100 mg once daily (or 50 mg bid); when used in such patients, frequent plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage adjustments. In patients with less severe renal disease, the initial dosage should be 100 mg every 12 hours; plasma level monitoring may also be useful in these patients during dosage adjustment. In both groups of patients, dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days), observing the patient closely for signs of adverse cardiac effects or other toxicity. It should be borne in mind that in these patients it may take longer than four days before a new steady-state plasma level is reached following a dosage change.\nBased on theoretical considerations, rather than experimental data, the following suggestion is made: when transferring patients from another antiarrhythmic drug to Flecainide allow at least two to four plasma half-lives to elapse for the drug being discontinued before starting Flecainide at the usual dosage. In patients where withdrawal of a previous antiarrhythmic agent is likely to produce life-threatening arrhythmias, the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient.\nWhen Flecainide is given in the presence of amiodarone, reduce the usual Flecainide dose by 50% and monitor the patient closely for adverse effects.\nPlasma level monitoring is strongly recommended to guide dosage with such combination therapy .\n\n【28】 #Plasma Level Monitoring\nThe large majority of patients successfully treated with Flecainide were found to have trough plasma levels between 0.2 and 1 mcg/mL. The probability of adverse experiences, especially cardiac, may increase with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these exceed 1 mcg/mL. Periodic monitoring of trough plasma levels may be useful in patient management. Plasma level monitoring is required in patients with severe renal failure or severe hepatic disease, since elimination of Flecainide from plasma may be markedly slower. Monitoring of plasma levels is strongly recommended in patients on concurrent amiodarone therapy and may also be helpful in patients with CHF and in patients with moderate renal disease.\n\n【29】 #How is Flecainide Supplied\nFlecainide Acetate Tablets USP 50 mg are white to off-white, round, convex faced tablets debossed with “RX794” on one side and plain on the other side.

If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg/benazepril 40 mg once daily. The dosing should be individualized and adjusted according to the patient’s clinical response.\n- Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5-10 mg while benazepril is effective in doses of 10-80 mg. In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg and benazepril doses of 10-40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- Benazepril 10 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg once daily.\n- Amlodipine 5 mg-benazepril 20 mg\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Do not co-administer aliskiren with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, including Lotrel in patients with diabetes.\n- Lotrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema, with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment, or patients who are hypersensitive to benazepril, to any other ACE inhibitor, to amlodipine, or to any of the excipients of Lotrel.\n\n【9】 ### Precautions\n- Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions\n- Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Lotrel) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. These reactions usually occur after one of the first few doses of the ACE inhibitor, but they sometimes do not appear until after months of therapy. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks.\n- Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. In U.S. clinical trials, symptoms consistent with angioedema were seen in none of the subjects who received placebo and in about 0.5% of the subjects who received benazepril. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, discontinue treatment with Lotrel and treat  immediately. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g. administer subcutaneous epinephrine injection 1:1000 (0.3-0.5 mL), promptly.\n- Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.\n- Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction\n- Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.\n- Patients with Aortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis, Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n- Hypotension\n- Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n- Fetal Toxicity\n- Pregnancy Category D\n- Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Lotrel as soon as possible.\n- Hepatitis and Hepatic Failure\n- Impaired Renal Function\n- Hyperkalemia - Cough\n- Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.\n- Surgery/Anesthesia - In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.\n- Lotrel has been evaluated for safety in over 2,991 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 400 were treated for more than 1 year.\n- The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Lotrel in these studies were cough and edema (including angioedema).\n- The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.\nCough was the only adverse event with at least possible relationship to treatment that was more common on Lotrel (3.3%) than on placebo (0.2%).\n- Edema refers to all edema, such as dependent edema, angioedema, facial edema.\n- Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with Lotrel or in postmarketing experience were the following:\nAsthenia and fatigue.\nInsomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, and decreased libido.\nFlushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, and dermatitis.\nDry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and esophagitis.\nNeutropenia\nHypokalemia.\nBack pain, musculoskeletal pain, cramps, and muscle cramps.\nPharyngitis.\nSexual problems such as impotence, and polyuria.\n- Monotherapies of benazepril and amlodipine have been evaluated for safety in clinical trials in over 6,000 and 11,000 patients, respectively. The observed adverse reactions to the monotherapies in these trials were similar to those seen in trials of Lotrel.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- In postmarketing experience with benazepril, there have been rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, thrombocytopenia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, orthostatic symptoms and hypotension, angina pectoris and arrhythmia, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, BUN increase, serum creatinine increased, renal impairment, impaired vision, agranulocytosis, neutropenia.\n- Rare reports in association with use of amlodipine: gingival hyperplasia, tachycardia, jaundice, and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis severe enough to require hospitalization), leucocytopenia, allergic reaction, hyperglycemia, dysgeusia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, syncope, peripheral neuropathy, hypertonia, visual impairment, diplopia, hypotension, vasculitis, rhinitis, gastritis, hyperhidrosis, pruritis, skin discoloration, urticaria, erythema multiform, muscle spasms, arthralgia, micturition disorder, nocturia, erectile dysfunction, malaise, weight decrease or gain.\n- Other potentially important adverse experiences attributed to other ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers include: eosinophilic pneumonitis (ACE inhibitors) and gynecomastia (CCBs). Other infrequently reported events included chest pain, ventricular extrasystole, gout, neuritis, tinnitus, alopecia, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations and somnolence.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\n- Simvastatin\n- Co-administration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily.\n- CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n- No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A4 inducers.\n- Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\n- Benazepril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, the patient’s serum potassium should be monitored frequently.\n- Lithium\n- Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. When coadministering Lotrel and lithium, frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\n- Gold\n- Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)\n- In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy.\n- The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors including benazepril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.\n- Antidiabetic agents\n- Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)\n- Do not co-administer aliskiren with Lotrel in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Lotrel in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min).\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category D\n- Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Lotrel as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Amlodipine and Benazepril in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The effect of Lotrel on labor and delivery has not been studied.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat.\n- It is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human milk. Nursing or drug should be discontinued.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to Lotrel:\n- If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Benazepril, which crosses the placenta, can theoretically be removed from the neonatal circulation by these means; there are occasional reports of benefit from these maneuvers, but experience is limited.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\n- In geriatrics, exposure to amlodipine is increased, thus consider lower initial doses of Lotrel.\n- Of the total number of patients who received Lotrel in U.S. clinical studies of Lotrel, over 19% were 65 or older while about 2% were 75 or older. Overall differences in effectiveness or safety were not observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amlodipine and Benazepril with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amlodipine and Benazepril with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\n- In patients with severe renal impairment systemic exposure to benazepril is increased. The recommended dose of benazepril in this subgroup is 5 mg which is not an available strength with Lotrel. Lotrel is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose adjustment of Lotrel is needed in patients with mild or moderate impairment of renal function.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency, thus consider using lower doses of Lotrel.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Amlodipine and Benazepril in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Amlodipine and Benazepril in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Amlodipine and Benazepril in the drug label.\n\n【27】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Only a few cases of human overdose with amlodipine have been reported. One patient was asymptomatic after a 250-mg ingestion; another, who combined 70 mg of amlodipine with an unknown large quantity of a benzodiazepine, developed refractory shock and died.\n- Human overdoses with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril have not been reported. In scattered reports of human overdoses with benazepril and other ACE inhibitors, there are no reports of death.\n- Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care.\n- To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison-Control Center In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.\n- Analyses of bodily fluids for concentrations of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites are not widely available. Such analyses are, in any event, not known to be of value in therapy or prognosis.\n\n【28】 ### Management\n- Patients should be admitted to hospital and, generally, should be managed in an intensive care setting, with continuous monitoring of cardiac function, blood gases, and blood biochemistry. Emergency supportive measures such as artificial ventilation or cardiac pacing should be instituted if appropriate.\n- In the event of a potentially life-threatening oral overdose, use induction of vomiting or gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal to remove the drug from the gastrointestinal tract (only if presented within 1 hour after ingestion of Lotrel).\n- Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote to benazepril, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research laboratories.\n- No data are available to suggest physiologic maneuvers (e.g. maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites. Benazeprilat is only slightly dialyzable; attempted clearance of amlodipine by hemodialysis or hemo-perfusion has not been reported, but amlodipine’s high protein binding makes it unlikely that these interventions will be of value.\n\n【29】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Amlodipine and Benazepril in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\n- Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with benazepril and amlodipine for up to 56 weeks had elevations of serum potassium up to 0.2 mEq/L.\n- Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\n- ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Lotrel remains to be elucidated.\n- While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension.\n- Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- Lotrel is a combination of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride.\n- Benazepril hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder, soluble (>100 mg/mL) in water, in ethanol, and in methanol. Benazepril hydrochloride’s chemical name is 3-amino-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1H-1-(3S)-benzazepine-1-acetic acid monohydrochloride; its structural formula is - Its empirical formula is C24H28N2O5HCl, and its molecular weight is 460.96.\n- Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril, is a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Benazepril is converted to benazeprilat by hepatic cleavage of the ester group.\n- Amlodipine besylate is the besylate salt of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.\n- Lotrel capsules are formulated in six different strengths for oral administration with a combination of amlodipine besylate equivalent to 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine, with 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of benazepril hydrochloride providing for the following available combinations: 2.5/10 mg, 5/10 mg, 5/20 mg, 5/40 mg, 10/20 mg and 10/40 mg.\n- The inactive ingredients of the capsules are calcium phosphate, cellulose compounds, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, gelatin, hydrogenated castor oil (not present in 5/40 mg or 10/40 mg strengths), iron oxides, lactose, magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch (potato) glycolate, starch (corn), talc, and titanium dioxide.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Single and multiple doses of 10 mg or more of benazepril cause inhibition of plasma ACE activity by at least 80%-90% for at least 24 hours after dosing. For up to 4 hours after a 10-mg dose, pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I were inhibited by 60%-90%.\n- Administration of benazepril to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt and/or volume depleted.\n- The antihypertensive effects of benazepril were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.\n- In normal human volunteers, single doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.\n- With chronic once daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105-114 mmHg) had about 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).\n- In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\n- Amlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and amlodipine from Lotrel are the same as when administered as individual tablets. Absorption from the individual tablets is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract; food effects on absorption from Lotrel have not been studied.\n- Absorption\n- Following oral administration of Lotrel, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6–12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 90%. Following oral administration of Lotrel, the peak plasma concentrations of benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. The cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its active metabolite, benazeprilat, which reaches peak plasma concentrations in 1.5-4 hours. The extent of absorption of benazepril is at least 37%. Amlodipine and benazepril exhibit dose proportional pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 2.5 and 10 mg and 10 and 20 mg, respectively.\n- Distribution\n- Metabolism\n- Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. Benazepril is extensively metabolized to form benazeprilat as the main metabolite, which occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis, mainly in the liver. Two minor metabolites are the acyl glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat.\n- Elimination\n- Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after once-daily dosing for 7 - 8 days. 10% of unchanged drug and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. Effective elimination half-life of amlodipine is 2 days. Benazepril is eliminated mainly by metabolic clearance. Benazeprilat is eliminated via the kidneys and the bile; renal excretion is the main route in patients with normal renal function. In the urine, benazepril accounts for less than 1 % and benazeprilat for about 20 % of an oral dose. Elimination of benazeprilat is biphasic with an initial half-life of about 3 hours and a terminal half-life of about 22 hours. Benazeprilat’s effective elimination half-life is 10-11 hours, while that of amlodipine is about 2 days, so steady-state levels of the two components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing.\n- Special populations\n- Geriatric patients: No specific clinical studies were performed to understand the impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and benazepril as fixed dose combination. As individual component amlodipine is extensively metabolized in the liver. In the elderly, clearance of amlodipine is decreased with resulting increases in peak plasma levels, elimination half-life and area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve.\n- Hepatic impairment: Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40–60%. Pharmacokinetics of benazepril is not significantly influenced by hepatic impairment.\n- Drug interactions\n- In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.\n- Cimetidine: Co-administration of amlodipine with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\n- Grapefruit juice: Co-administration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\n- Maalox (antacid): Co-administration of the antacid Maalox with a single dose of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\n- Sildenafil: A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.\n- Atorvastatin: Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.\n- Digoxin: Co-administration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.\n- Ethanol (alcohol): Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.\n- Warfarin: Co-administration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.\n- CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent.\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with this combination. However, these studies have been conducted with amlodipine and benazepril alone . No adverse effects on fertility occurred when the benazepril:amlodipine combination was given orally to rats of either sex at doses up to 15:7.5 mg (benazepril:amlodipine)/kg/day, prior to mating and throughout gestation.\n- Benazepril\n- No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when benazepril was administered to rats and mice for up to two years at doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day. When compared on the basis of body surface area, this dose is 18 and 9 times (rats and mice, respectively) the maximum recommended human dose (calculations assume a patient weight of 60 kg). No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria, in an in vitro test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50-500 mg/kg/day (6-60 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.\n- Amlodipine\n- When rats received benazepril:amlodipine at doses ranging from 5:2.5 to 50:25 mg/kg/day, dystocia was observed at an increasing dose-related incidence at all doses tested. On a body surface area basis, the 2.5 mg/kg/day dose of amlodipine is 3.6 times the amlodipine dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of Lotrel is given to a 50-kg woman. Similarly, the 5 mg/kg/day dose of benazepril is approximately twice the benazepril dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of Lotrel is given to a 50-kg woman.  No teratogenic effects were seen when benazepril and amlodipine were administered in combination to pregnant rats or rabbits. Rats received doses of up to 50:25 mg (benazepril:amlodipine)/kg/day (24 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis, assuming a 50-kg woman). Rabbits received doses of up to 1.5:0.75 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the maximum recommended dose of Lotrel given to a 50-kg woman).\n- No teratogenic effects of benazepril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits. On a body surface area basis, the maximum doses used in these studies were 60 times (in rats), 9 times (in mice), and about equivalent to (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (assuming a 50-kg woman).\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\n- Over 950 patients received Lotrel once daily in six double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing.\n- Once-daily doses of benazepril/amlodipine using benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.\n- In two studies in patients not adequately controlled on either benazepril 40 mg alone (n=329) or amlodipine 10 mg alone (n=812) once daily doses of Lotrel 10/40 mg further decreased seated blood pressure compared to the respective monotherapy alone.\n- Combination therapy was effective in blacks and nonblacks. Both components contributed to the antihypertensive efficacy in nonblacks, but virtually all of the antihypertensive effect in blacks could be attributed to the amlodipine component. Among nonblack patients in placebo-controlled trials comparing Lotrel to the individual components, the blood pressure lowering effects of the combination were shown to be additive and in some cases synergistic.\n- During chronic therapy with Lotrel, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any given dose is generally achieved after 1-2 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of Lotrel have continued during therapy for at least 1 year. Abrupt withdrawal of Lotrel has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- Lotrel is available as capsules containing amlodipine besylate equivalent to 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine, with 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of benazepril hydrochloride providing for the following available combinations: 2.5/10 mg, 5/10 mg, 5/20 mg, 5/40 mg, 10/20 mg and 10/40 mg. All six strengths are packaged in bottles of 100 capsules.\n- Capsules are imprinted with “Lotrel” and appropriate code.\n- Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F). Protect from moisture. Dispense in tight container (USP).\n\n【37】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Amlodipine and Benazepril Storage in the drug label.\n\n【38】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to Lotrel during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.\n\n【39】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Amlodipine and Benazepril interaction has not been established. Talk to your doctor about the effects of taking alcohol with this medication.\n\n【40】 #Brand Names\n- LOTREL\n\n【41】 #Look-Alike Drug Names\nThere is limited information regarding Amlodipine and Benazepril Look-Alike Drug Names in the drug label.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:21:34"}

Clinical studies with DYSPORT in cervical dystonia suggest that the peak effect occurs between two and four weeks after injection. Simultaneous EMG-guided application of DYSPORT may be helpful in locating active muscles not identified by physical examination alone.\n- Where dose modification is necessary for the treatment of cervical dystonia, uncontrolled open-label studies suggest that dose adjustment can be made in 250 Unit steps according to the individual patient's response, with re-treatment every 12 weeks or longer, as necessary, based on return of clinical symptoms. Uncontrolled open-label studies also suggest that the total dose administered in a single treatment should be between 250 Units and 1000 Units. Re-treatment, if needed, should not occur in intervals of less than 12 weeks. Doses above 1000 Units have not been systematically evaluated.\nSpecial Populations\nAdults and elderly\nChildren\n- The safety and effectiveness of DYSPORT in the treatment of cervical dystonia in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age has not been assessed.\nInstructions for Preparation and Administration\n- DYSPORT is supplied as a single-use vial. Each 500 Unit vial of DYSPORT is to be reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative) to yield a solution of 500 Units per mL. Each 300 Unit vial of DYSPORT is to be reconstituted with 0.6 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative) to yield a solution equivalent to 250 Units per 0.5 mL.\n- Expel any air bubbles in the syringe barrel. Remove the needle used to reconstitute the product and attach an appropriately sized new sterile needle.\n- Once reconstituted, DYSPORT should be stored in a refrigerator at 2–8°C (36–46°F) protected from light and used within 24 hours. Do not freeze reconstituted DYSPORT. Discard the vial and needle in accordance with local regulations.\n- A total dose of 50 Units of DYSPORT, in five equal aliquots, should be administered to achieve clinical effect.\n- The clinical effect of DYSPORT may last up to four months. Repeat dose clinical studies demonstrated continued efficacy with up to four repeated administrations. It should be administered no more frequently than every three months. When used for re-treatment, DYSPORT should be reconstituted and injected using the same techniques as the initial treatment.\n- DYSPORT for glabellar lines is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\n- Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle and aseptic technique, draw up 2.5 mL or 1.5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative). Insert the needle into the DYSPORT vial. The partial vacuum will begin to pull the saline into the vial. Any remaining required saline should be expressed into the vial manually. Do not use the vial if no vacuum is observed. Swirl gently to dissolve. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Reconstituted DYSPORT should be a clear, colorless solution, free of particulate matter otherwise it should not be injected.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Botulinum toxin in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Botulinum toxin in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Botulinum toxin in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Botulinum toxin in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Botulinum toxin in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- DYSPORT is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the formulation.\n- This product may contain trace amounts of cow's milk protein. Patients known to be allergic to cow's milk protein should not be treated with DYSPORT.\n\n【9】 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products\n- The potency Units of DYSPORT are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of DYSPORT cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method .\nSpread of Toxin Effect\n- Post-marketing safety data from DYSPORT and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of the symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and adults, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia.\nDysphagia and Breathing Difficulties in Treatment of Cervical Dystonia - Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several weeks, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.\n- Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin.\nFacial Anatomy in the Treatment of Glabellar Lines\n- Caution should be exercised when administering DYSPORT to patients with surgical alterations to the facial anatomy, excessive weakness or atrophy in the target muscle(s), marked facial asymmetry, inflammation at the injection site(s), ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, thick sebaceous skin or the inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines by physically spreading them apart.\n- Do not exceed the recommended dosage and frequency of administration of DYSPORT. In clinical trials, subjects who received a higher dose of DYSPORT had an increased incidence of eyelid ptosis.\nPre-existing Neuromuscular Disorders\nHuman Albumin\nIntradermal Immune Reaction\n- The possibility of an immune reaction when injected intradermally is unknown. The safety of DYSPORT for the treatment of hyperhidrosis has not been established.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following adverse reactions to DYSPORT are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.\n- Hypersensitivity\n- Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties in Treatment of Cervical Dystonia - Spread of Effects from Toxin\nClinical Studies Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating incidence rates.\nCervical Dystonia - The data described below reflect exposure to DYSPORT in 357 cervical dystonia patients in 6 studies. Of these, two studies were randomized, double-blind, single treatment, placebo controlled studies with subsequent optional open label treatment in which dose optimization (250 to 1000 Units per treatment) over the course of 5 treatment cycles was allowed.\n- The population was almost entirely Caucasian (99.2%) with a median age of 51 years (range 18–82 years). Most patients (86.6%) were less than 65 years of age; 58.4% were women.\nCommon Adverse Events\n- The most commonly reported adverse events (occurring in more than 5% of patients who received 500 Units of DYSPORT in the placebo controlled clinical trials) in cervical dystonia patients were muscular weakness, dysphagia, dry mouth, injection site discomfort, fatigue, headache, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain, dysphonia, injection site pain, and eye disorders (consisting of blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity and accommodation). Most adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity. Other than injection site reactions, most adverse events became noticeable about one week after treatment and lasted several weeks.\n- During the clinical studies, two patients (<1%) experienced adverse events leading to withdrawal. One patient experienced disturbance in attention, eyelid disorder, feeling abnormal and headache, and one patient experienced dysphagia.\n\n【11】 Injection Site Reactions\n- Injection site discomfort and injection site pain were common adverse events following DYSPORT administration. These events were mainly of mild or moderate intensity.\nLess Common Adverse Events\n- The following selected adverse events were reported less frequently (<5%).\nBreathing Difficulties\n- Other selected adverse events with incidences of less than 5% in the DYSPORT 500 Units group in the double-blind phase of clinical trials included dizziness in 3.5% of DYSPORT-treated subjects and 1% of placebo-treated subjects, and muscle atrophy in 1% of DYSPORT-treated subjects and in none of the placebo-treated subjects.\nLaboratory Findings\n- Subjects treated with DYSPORT exhibited a small increase from baseline (0.23 mol/L) in mean blood glucose relative to placebo-treated subjects. This was not clinically significant among subjects in the development program but could be a factor in patients whose diabetes is difficult to control.\nElectrocardiographic Findings\nGlabellar Lines\n- In placebo-controlled clinical trials of DYSPORT, the most frequently reported adverse events (≥2%) following injection of DYSPORT were nasopharyngitis, headache, injection site pain, injection site reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, eyelid edema, eyelid ptosis, sinusitis and nausea.\n- In the overall safety database, where some subjects received up to twelve treatments with DYSPORT, adverse events were reported for 57% (1425/2491) of subjects. The most frequently reported of these adverse events were headache, nasopharyngitis, injection site pain, sinusitis, URI, injection site bruising, and injection site reaction (numbness, discomfort, erythema, tenderness, tingling, itching, stinging, warmth, irritation, tightness, swelling).\n- Adverse events that emerged after repeated injections in 2–3% of the population included bronchitis, influenza, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cough, contact dermatitis, injection site swelling, and injection site discomfort.\nImmunogenicity\n- As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is extensive post-marketing experience outside the U.S. for the treatment of glabellar lines. Adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; thus, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use: vertigo, eyelid ptosis, diplopia, vision blurred, photophobia, dysphagia, nausea, injection site reaction, malaise, influenza-like illness, hypersensitivity, sinusitis, amyotrophy, burning sensation, facial paresis, dizziness, headache, hypoesthesia, erythema, and excessive granulation tissue.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with DYSPORT.\n- Patients treated concomitantly with botulinum toxins and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g. curare-like agents) should be observed closely because the effect of the botulinum toxin may be potentiated. Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of DYSPORT may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects such as blurred vision.\n- Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of DYSPORT.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- DYSPORT produced embryo-fetal toxicity when given to pregnant rats at doses similar to or greater than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1000 Units on a body weight (Units/kg) basis.\n- In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats received intramuscular injections daily (2.2, 6.6, or 22 Units/kg on gestation days 6 through 17) or intermittently (44 Units/kg on gestation days 6 and 12 only) during organogenesis, increased early embryonic death was observed with both dosing schedules. The no-effect dose for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was 2.2 Units/kg (one-tenth the MRHD on a body weight basis). Maternal toxicity was seen at 22 and 44 Units/kg. In a pre-and post-natal development study in which female rats received 6 weekly intramuscular injections (4.4, 11.1, 22.2, or 44 Units/kg) beginning on day 6 of gestation and continuing through parturition to weaning, an increase in stillbirths was observed at the highest dose, which was maternally toxic. The no-effect dose for pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity was 22.2 Units/kg (approximately equal to the MRHD on a body weight basis).\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. DYSPORT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Botulinum toxin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Botulinum toxin during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether DYSPORT is excreted in human milk.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\nCervical Dystonia - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\nGlabellar Lines\n- DYSPORT is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nCervical Dystonia - There were insufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over in the clinical studies to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, elderly patients should be observed to evaluate their tolerability of DYSPORT, due to the greater frequency of concomitant disease and other drug therapy.\nGlabellar Lines\n- Of the total number of subjects in the placebo-controlled clinical studies of DYSPORT, 8 (1%) were 65 and over. Efficacy was not observed in subjects 65 years and over. For the entire safety database of geriatric subjects, although there was no increase in the incidence of eyelid ptosis, geriatric subjects did have an increase in the number of ocular adverse events compared to younger subjects (11% vs. 5%).\n\n【19】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Botulinum toxin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nEthnic Groups\n- Exploratory analyses in trials for glabellar lines in African-American subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, or VI and in Hispanic subjects suggested that response rates at Day 30 were comparable to and no worse than the overall population.ulations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Botulinum toxin in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Botulinum toxin in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Botulinum toxin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Botulinum toxin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- The potency Units of DYSPORT are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of DYSPORT cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method .\n- Reconstitution instructions are specific for each of the 300 Unit vial and the 500 Unit vial. These volumes yield concentrations specific for the use for each indication.\nCervical Dystonia - The recommended initial dose of DYSPORT for the treatment of cervical dystonia is 500 Units given intramuscularly as a divided dose among affected muscles in patients with or without a history of prior treatment with botulinum toxin Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Clinical studies with DYSPORT in cervical dystonia suggest that the peak effect occurs between two and four weeks after injection. Simultaneous EMG-guided application of DYSPORT may be helpful in locating active muscles not identified by physical examination alone.\nDose Modification\n- Where dose modification is necessary for the treatment of cervical dystonia, uncontrolled open-label studies suggest that dose adjustment can be made in 250 Unit steps according to the individual patient's response, with re-treatment every 12 weeks or longer, as necessary, based on return of clinical symptoms. Uncontrolled open-label studies also suggest that the total dose administered in a single treatment should be between 250 Units and 1000 Units. Re-treatment, if needed, should not occur in intervals of less than 12 weeks. Doses above 1000 Units have not been systematically evaluated.\nSpecial Populations\nAdults and elderly\n- The starting dose of 500 Units recommended for cervical dystonia is applicable to adults of all ages .\nChildren\n- The safety and effectiveness of DYSPORT in the treatment of cervical dystonia in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age has not been assessed.\nInstructions for Preparation and Administration\n- DYSPORT is supplied as a single-use vial. Each 500 Unit vial of DYSPORT is to be reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative) to yield a solution of 500 Units per mL. Each 300 Unit vial of DYSPORT is to be reconstituted with 0.6 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative) to yield a solution equivalent to 250 Units per 0.5 mL.\n- Expel any air bubbles in the syringe barrel. Remove the needle used to reconstitute the product and attach an appropriately sized new sterile needle.\n- Once reconstituted, DYSPORT should be stored in a refrigerator at 2–8°C (36–46°F) protected from light and used within 24 hours. Do not freeze reconstituted DYSPORT. Discard the vial and needle in accordance with local regulations.\nGlabellar Lines\n- A total dose of 50 Units of DYSPORT, in five equal aliquots, should be administered to achieve clinical effect.\n- DYSPORT for glabellar lines is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\n- Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle and aseptic technique, draw up 2.5 mL or 1.5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative). Insert the needle into the DYSPORT vial. The partial vacuum will begin to pull the saline into the vial. Any remaining required saline should be expressed into the vial manually. Do not use the vial if no vacuum is observed. Swirl gently to dissolve. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Reconstituted DYSPORT should be a clear, colorless solution, free of particulate matter otherwise it should not be injected.\nInjection Technique\n- Risk of ptosis can be mitigated by careful examination of the upper lid for separation or weakness of the levator palpebrae muscle (true ptosis), identification of lash ptosis, and evaluation of the range of lid excursion while manually depressing the frontalis to assess compensation.\n- In order to reduce the complication of ptosis, the following steps should be taken:\n- Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow depressor complexes.\n- Medial corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 centimeter above the bony supraorbital ridge.\n- Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum.\n- Do not inject toxin closer than 1 centimeter above the central eyebrow.\nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- DYSPORT is supplied as:\n- a single-use, sterile 500 Unit vial for reconstitution with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (without preservative) to yield a solution of 500 Units per mL.\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Botulinum toxin in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Botulinum toxin in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\n- Excessive doses of DYSPORT may be expected to produce neuromuscular weakness with a variety of symptoms. Respiratory support may be required where excessive doses cause paralysis of respiratory muscles. In the event of overdose, the patient should be medically monitored for symptoms of excessive muscle weakness or muscle paralysis. Symptomatic treatment may be necessary.\n- Symptoms of overdose are likely not to be present immediately following injection. Should accidental injection or oral ingestion occur, the person should be medically supervised for several weeks for signs and symptoms of excessive muscle weakness or paralysis.\n- There is no significant information regarding overdose from clinical studies in cervical dystonia. Doses exceeding 1000 Units of DYSPORT were rarely studied in clinical settings for any indication.\n- In the event of overdose, antitoxin raised against botulinum toxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA.  However, the antitoxin will not reverse any botulinum toxin-induced effects already apparent by the time of antitoxin administration. More information can be obtained at .\n\n【29】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- DYSPORT inhibits release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. Toxin activity occurs in the following sequence: Toxin heavy chain mediated binding to specific surface receptors on nerve endings, internalization of the toxin by receptor mediated endocytosis, pH-induced translocation of the toxin light chain to the cell cytosol and cleavage of SNAP25 leading to intracellular blockage of neurotransmitter exocytosis into the neuromuscular junction. This accounts for the therapeutic utility of the toxin in diseases characterized by excessive efferent activity in motor nerves.\n- Recovery of transmission occurs gradually as the neuromuscular junction recovers from SNAP25 cleavage and as new nerve endings are formed.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\n- Botulinum toxin type A, the active ingredient in DYSPORT (abobotulinumtoxinA), is a purified neurotoxin type A complex produced by fermentation of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum type A, Hall Strain. It is purified from the culture supernatant by a series of precipitation, dialysis, and chromatography steps. The neurotoxin complex is composed of the neurotoxin, hemagglutinin proteins and non-toxin non-hemagglutinin protein.\n- DYSPORT is supplied in a single-use, sterile vial for reconstitution intended for intramuscular injection. Each vial contains 500 or 300 Units of lyophilized abobotulinumtoxinA, 125 micrograms human serum albumin and 2.5 mg lactose. DYSPORT may contain trace amounts of cow's milk proteins.\n- One unit of DYSPORT corresponds to the calculated median lethal intraperitoneal dose (LD50) in mice. The method for performing the assay is specific to Ipsen's product DYSPORT\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The primary pharmacodynamic effect of DYSPORT is due to chemical denervation of the treated muscle resulting in a measurable decrease of the compound muscle action potential, causing a localized reduction of muscle activity.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Using currently available analytical technology, it is not possible to detect DYSPORT in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the recommended doses.\n\n【33】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility\n- Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of DYSPORT have not been conducted.\nMutagenicity\n- Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted for DYSPORT.\nImpairment of Fertility\n- In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats in which either males (2.9, 7.2, 14.5 or 29 Units/kg) or females (7.4, 19.7, 39.4 or 78.8 Units/kg) received weekly intramuscular injections prior to and after mating, dose-related increases in pre-implantation loss and reduced numbers of corpora lutea were noted in treated females. Failure to mate was observed in males that received the high dose. The no-effect dose for effects on fertility was 7.4 Units/kg in females and 14.5 Units/kg in males (approximately one-half and equal to, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose of 1000 Units on a body weight basis).\n\n【34】 #Clinical Studies\nCervical Dystonia - The efficacy of DYSPORT was evaluated in two well-controlled, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single dose, parallel group studies in treatment-naïve cervical dystonia patients. The principal analyses from these trials provide the primary demonstration of efficacy involving 252 patients (121 on DYSPORT, 131 on placebo) with 36% male and 64% female. Ninety-nine percent of the patients were Caucasian.\n- In both placebo controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2), a dose of 500 Units DYSPORT was given by intramuscular injection divided among two to four affected muscles. These studies were followed by long-term open label extensions that allowed titration in 250 Unit steps to doses in a range of 250 to 1000 Units, after the initial dose of 500 Units. In the extension studies, re-treatment was determined by clinical need after a minimum of 12 weeks. The median time to re-treatment was 14 weeks and 18 weeks for the 75th percentile.\n- Analyses by gender, weight, geographic region, underlying pain, cervical dystonia severity at baseline and history of treatment with botulinum toxin did not show any meaningful differences between groups.\n\n【35】 Glabellar Lines\n- Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical studies evaluated the efficacy of DYSPORT for use in the temporary improvement of the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines. These three studies enrolled healthy adults (ages 19-75) with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Subjects were excluded if they had marked ptosis, deep dermal scarring, or a substantial inability to lessen glabellar lines, even by physically spreading them apart. The subjects in these studies received either DYSPORT or placebo. The total dose was delivered in equally divided aliquots to specified injection sites .\n- Investigators and subjects assessed efficacy at maximum frown by using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe).\n- Overall treatment success was defined as post-treatment glabellar line severity of none or mild with at least 2 grade improvement from Baseline for the combined investigator and subject assessments (composite assessment) on Day 30 . Additional endpoints for each of the studies were post-treatment glabellar line severity of none or mild with at least a 1 grade improvement from Baseline for the separate investigator and subject assessments on Day 30.\n- Treatment with DYSPORT reduced the severity of glabellar lines for up to four months.\nStudy GL-1\n- In study GL-1, the reduction of glabellar line severity at maximum frown was greater at Day 30 in the DYSPORT group compared to the placebo group as assessed by both Investigators and subjects .\n- At Day 30, 52% of DYSPORT-treated subjects achieved treatment success: a composite 2 grade improvement of glabellar line severity at maximum frown .\n- The proportion of responders in the final treatment cycle was comparable to the proportion of responders in all prior treatment cycles.\n- Study GL-3 was a single dose, double-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which 300 previously untreated subjects received either placebo or 50 Units of DYSPORT, administered in five aliquots of 10 Units . Subjects were followed for 150 days. The mean age was 44 years; most of the subjects were women (87%), and predominantly Caucasian (75%) or Hispanic (18%).\nGeriatric Subjects\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- DYSPORT for Injection is supplied in a sterile, single-use, 3 mL glass vial. DYSPORT must be stored under refrigeration at 2–8°C (36–46°F). Protect from light.\n- Administer DYSPORT within 24 hours of reconstitution; during this period reconstituted DYSPORT should be stored under refrigeration at 2–8°C (36–46°F). Do not freeze after reconstitution.\n- Do not use after the expiration date on the vial. All vials, including expired vials, or equipment used with DYSPORT should be disposed of carefully as is done with all medical waste.\n- DYSPORT contains a unique hologram on the carton. If you do not see the hologram, do not use the product.\nCervical Dystonia - 500 Unit Vial\n- Each vial contains 500 Units of freeze-dried abobotulinumtoxinA.\n\n【37】 - Glabellar Lines\n\n【38】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Botulinum toxin Storage in the drug label.\n\n【39】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- The physician should provide a copy of the FDA-Approved Patient Medication Guide and review the contents with the patient. Patients should be advised to inform their doctor or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptoms (including difficulty with swallowing, speaking or breathing), or if any known symptom persists or worsens.\n- Patients should be counseled that if loss of strength, muscle weakness, blurred vision or drooping eyelids occur, they should avoid driving a car or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities.\n\n【40】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Botulinum toxin interaction has not been established.

In one of his books, he described a patient with celiac disease and called it 'koiliakos'. It came from Greek word of 'koelia' (abdomen), explaining diarrhea as the inability to retain  food and the passage of undigested material through the gastrointestinal tract. This later formed the basis of explanation of various diseases presenting as chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, including celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD) may be classified according to the symptoms and laboratory findings into 5 sub groups as, classical, atypical, asymptomatic, latent, and potential CD Hematologic findings include low folate and vitamin B-12 levels, low serum ironlevel and prothrombin time (PT) prolongation. Stool examination may show fat droplets on Sudan stain and a 72-hour fecal fat collection may be used for documentation of steatorrhea. Features present on CT enteroclysis consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease may include, jejunoileal fold pattern reversal, ileal fold thickening, vascular engorgement, prominent mesenteric lymph nodes may cavitate with a fluid-fat level, submucosal fat deposition may be observed in long standing cases, and features suggestive of splenic atrophy may be present. Preferred therapy for celiac disease is dietary modification which includes gluten-free diet. Patients with celiac disease should be referred to a dietitian once the diagnosis of celiac disease is made. A minority of patients suffer from refractory disease, which means that they do not improve with a gluten-free diet. Pharmocotherapy is used if alternative causes are eliminated and dietary modification is not beneficial. Pharmacotherapy include steroids, azathioprine, cyclosporin, and monoclonal antibodies. Effective measures for the primary prevention of celiac disease include breastfeeding, delayed introduction of gluten-including diet, and preventing GI infections.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nSince the advent of human life on the earth, human beings have met their nutritional demands through hunting. In times of scarce supply of food from animal sources humans used to turn to fruits, seeds, and nuts for their nutritional needs. About 8,000 years ago, Aretaeus, a Greek physician from Cappadocia, wrote a total of 8 books on medicine. In one of his books, he described a patient with celiac disease and called it 'koiliakos'. It came from Greek word of 'koelia' (abdomen), explaining diarrhea as the inability to retain  food and the passage of undigested material through the gastrointestinal tract. This later formed the basis of explanation of various diseases presenting as chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, including celiac disease. In October 1887, Samuel Gee, an English pediatrician, comprehensively explained celiac disease in one of his lectures. Gee was of the opinion that if a patient affected by celiac disease can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet. He also added that the percentage of farinaceous food intake in celiac patients must be low. Gee also introduced the concept of gluten-free diet for the relief of symptoms.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nCeliac disease (CD) may be classified according to the symptoms and laboratory findings into 5 sub groups as, classical, atypical, asymptomatic, latent, and potential CD.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThe etiology of the celiac disease is known to be multifactorial, both in that multiple factors can lead to the disease and that multiple factors are necessary for the disease to manifest in a patient. Gluten triggers autoimmunity and results in the inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Gluten in wheat, rye, and barley may trigger the autoimmunity to develop celiac disease. Gluten peptides cross the epithelium into the lamina propria where they are deamidated by tissue transglutaminase. The peptides are then presented by DQ2+ or DQ8+ antigen-presenting cells to pathogenic CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cells trigger the T-helper-cell type 1 response which results in the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria and epithelium. This inflammatory process ultimately leads to crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy. It is suggested that the gliadin may be responsible for the primary manifestations of celiac disease whereas tTG is a bigger factor in secondary effects such as allergic responses and secondary autoimmune disease. Over 95% of celiac patients have an isoform of DQ2 (encoded by DQA1*05 and DQB1*02 genes) and DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increased risk of celiac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process. Celiac disease is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, IgA deficiency, IgA nephropathy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), Sjogren’s syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves Disease, and dermatitis herpetiformis.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nThe common causes of celiac disease are autoantibodies to gluten and certain genetic factors.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Celiac Disease from other Diseases\nCeliac disease must be differentiated from other diseases presenting as chronic diarrhea. Common differentials of celiac disease include lactose intolerance, cystic fibrosis, Crohns disease,  laxative overuse, hyperthyroidism and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nCeliac disease is more prevalent than previously thought. The prevalence of celiac disease in 2017 is estimated to be 500 to 1000 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The incidence of celiac disease is approximately 10-13 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Celiac disease affects children and adults alike. Celiac disease usually affects individuals of the non-Hispanic whites (1000 per 100,000 individuals), Hispanics (300 per 100,000 individuals) and non-Hispanic blacks (200 per 100,000 individuals). Like other autoimmune disorders, women are more commonly affected by celiac disease than men. In Africa, Algerian refugees have the highest number of prevalence rate at 5600 per 100,000 individuals.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of celiac disease include a positive family history, HLA genes, other autoimmune diseases, infections, and certain drugs.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nScreening with tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA test is recommended for symptomatic high risk celiac disease patients.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe symptoms of celiac disease usually develop in the first decade of life, and start with symptoms suggestive of malabsorption such as abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, malnutrition, and failure to thrive within the first few years of life. The classic malabsorption manifestation of disease is just the tip of the iceberg, and other more specific manifestations are invisible below the waterline. Natural history of celiac disease variations is not completely understood but if left untreated it may result in serious complications, such as malignancy. Complications of celiac disease may include vitamin deficiencies related syndromes, essential nutrient deficiencies, enamel hypoplasias, neurological abnormalities, gastrointestinal malignancies, hyposplenism, ulcerative jejunitis, and infertility. Depending on the extent of the celiac disease at the time of diagnosis and also extent of complications and dietary deficiencies, the prognosis may vary. However, the prognosis is generally regarded as good. The presence of gastrointestinal malignancies is associated with a particularly poor prognosis among patients with celiac disease.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\nThe diagnosis of celiac disease is made when at least four of the following five or three out of four (if the HLA genotype is not performed) diagnostic criteria are met: typical symptoms (chronic diarrhea, chronic abdominal pain, malabsorption, bloating, constipation, failure to thrive/weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, GERD), serum positivity for Ig A autoantibodies at high titer, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genotypes, celiac enteropathy at the small intestinal biopsy, and response to gluten-free diet.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nCeliac disease can present with typical symptoms such as diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, and growth failure or non-typical symptoms not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The classic presentation of celiac disease is more common in young children, consisting primarily of gastrointestinal symptoms. In adults, the presentation of celiac disease is often more subtle and can be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome. Some patients lack any evident gastrointestinal symptom and instead present with nutritional deficiencies (most commonly iron deficiency) or extra-intestinal symptoms, or are asymptomatic.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPatients with celiac disease usually appear tired. Common physical examination findings of celiac disease include hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness with distention and scaly rash on extensor surfaces.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease include electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis,hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hypocholesterolemia and low serum carotene level. Hematologic findings include low folate and vitamin B-12 levels, low serum ironlevel and prothrombin time (PT) prolongation. Stool examination may show fat droplets on Sudan stain and a 72-hour fecal fat collection may be used for documentation of steatorrhea. Genetic testing is usually positive for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. Serologic markers include IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA), IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody(IgA tTG), IgG tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgG tTG), IgA deamidated gliadin peptide (IgA DGP), and IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (IgG DGP). Serum IgA EMA and IgAtTG have the highest diagnostic accuracy. The IgA and IgG antigliadin antibody (AGA) are not recommended for establishing diagnosis because they have low accuracy and give more false positive results when compared with IgA tTG and IgA DGP assays.\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with celiac disease.\n\n【16】 ## Chest X Ray\nAbdominal x-ray findings that are suggestive for celiac disease include small bowel dilatation, stack of coin appearance (hidebound sign), segmentation, mucosal atrophy, and transient intussusception.\n\n【17】 ## CT Scan\nFeatures present on CT enteroclysis consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease may include, jejunoileal fold pattern reversal, ileal fold thickening, vascular engorgement, prominent mesenteric lymph nodes may cavitate with a fluid-fat level, submucosal fat deposition may be observed in long standing cases, and features suggestive of splenic atrophy may be present.\n\n【18】 ## MRI\nThere are no MRI findings associated with celiac disease.MRI has a great specificity among all imaging modalities for celiac disease diagnosis, but the sensitivity of MRI differs based on the finding. MRI may be normal in less than 20% of cases. The most important intestinal findings of MRI include: Bowel dilatation, increased number of ileal folds, reversed fold pattern abnormality, increased intestinal wall thickness, intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, mesenteric vascular changes, ascites.\n\n【19】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\nThere are no ultrasound abnormalities associated with celiac disease.\n\n【20】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nFeatures of small bowel barium studies are not sensitive enough for confident diagnosis, but the following changes may be seen: Small intestinal dilatation due to excess fluid, dilution of contrast, multiple non-obstructing intussusceptions, jejunoileal fold pattern reversal, moulage sign, mosaic pattern, flocculation, and segmentation.\n\n【21】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nEndoscopy may be helpful in the diagnosis of celiac disease especially when the biopsies of luminal wall are obtained for microscopic evaluation. Most patients with celiac disease have a small bowel that appears normal on endoscopy; however the following findings are more suggestive of celiac disease: Scalloping of the small bowel folds, paucity in the folds, mosaic pattern of the mucosa, prominence of the submucosal blood vessels, and Nodular pattern to the mucosa.\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nPreferred therapy for celiac disease is dietary modification which includes gluten-free diet. Patients with celiac disease should be referred to a dietitian once the diagnosis of celiac disease is made. A minority of patients suffer from refractory disease, which means that they do not improve with a gluten-free diet. Pharmocotherapy is used if alternative causes are eliminated and dietary modification is not beneficial. Pharmacotherapy include steroids, azathioprine, cyclosporin, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【23】 ## Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of celiac disease include breastfeeding, delayed introduction of gluten-including diet, and preventing GI infections.\n\n【24】 ## Secondary Prevention\nEffective measures for the secondary prevention of celiac disease include avoiding gluten-containing diet and vaccination against encapsulated organisms in individuals with hyposplenism.\n\n【25】 ## Future or Investigational Therapies\nVarious approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dietary modification (gluten-free diet). Most of them are still under development and include genetically engineered wheat species, enzymes, gluten vaccination, biological agents, and inhibition of endogenous signaling protein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:10:46"}

Prior to insertion, a cervical Pap smear, tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia, and a pelvic exam should be conducted.\n- One system containing 38 mg of progesterone should be inserted into the uterus using the inserter provided. The system should be removed and replaced every 12 months for continued effectiveness.\n- Patients should be advised that this product will not protect them from HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases.\n- The patient should return for a check up 3 months after insertion and at 12 months for removal and replacement of the system.\n- Should not be inserted until involution of the uterus is complete following abortion or child birth.\n\n【3】 ### Abnormal uterine bleeding unrelated to menstrual cycle\n- Dosing Information:\n- Progesterone 5 to 10 mg is injected IM daily for 6 doses. The bleeding should be expected to stop within 6 days. If the menstrual flow begins during the course of progesterone injections, therapy should be stopped. If estrogen therapy is to be used, progesterone should be initiated after 2 weeks of estrogen therapy.\n\n【4】 ### Assisted reproductive technology; Adjunct - Female infertility\n- Dosing Information:\n- Vaginal Gel:\n- Progesterone gel (Crinone(R) 8%) 90 mg once daily is administered vaginally in women who require progesterone supplementation. In women with partial or complete ovarian failure who require progesterone replacement, a dose of 90 mg twice daily is administered.\n- A desired dosage increase from the 4% gel can only be achieved by using the 8% gel rather than increasing the volume of the 4% gel.\n- Administer 100 mg vaginal insert vaginally 2 to 3 times a day starting the day after oocyte retrieval and continuing for up to 10 weeks total duration for women undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology treatment for infertility.\n\n【5】 ### Endometrial hyperplasia; Prophylaxis - Dosing Information:\n- Oral micronized progesterone should be given as a single daily dose in the evening, 200 mg for 12 days sequentially per 28-day cycle, to postmenopausal women with a uterus who are receiving daily conjugated estrogen tablets.\n\n【6】 ### Secondary physiologic amenorrhea - Dosing Information:\n- In the treatment of amenorrhea, progesterone 5 to 10 mg in oil should be administered IM daily for 6 to 8 days (Prod Info Progesterone USP, 2000). If a proliferative endometrium is produced, withdrawal bleeding should occur within 48 to 72 hours after discontinuing the progesterone. This may be followed by spontaneous normal cycles.\n- Oral progesterone may be given as a single daily dose of 400 mg in the evening for 10 days.\n- For secondary amenorrhea, vaginal progesterone gel 4% is administered every other day up to a total of 6 doses. For those who fail to respond, a trial of 8% (90 mg) every other day up to a total of 6 doses may be used (Prod Info Crinone(R), 2000).\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Progesterone (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Progesterone (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Progesterone (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Progesterone (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【11】 #Contraindications\n- PROMETRIUM Capsules should not be used in women with any of the following conditions:\n- Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.\n- Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer.\n- Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or history of these conditions.\n\n【12】 - See BOXED WARNING.\nCardiovascular disorders\n- An increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke, and myocardial infarction has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n- Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (for example, personal history or family history of venous thromboembolism , obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\nStroke\n- In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\nCoronary Heart Disease\n- In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average age 66.7 years), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study ), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one  women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open-label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.\nVenous Thromboembolism\n- If feasible, estrogens with progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\nMalignant neoplasms\nBreast Cancer\n- The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 percent nCI, 1.01-1.54), and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.\n- Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n- The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\nEndometrial Cancer\nOvarian Cancer\nProbable dementia - In the estrogen plus progestin Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.\nVision abnormalities\n\n【13】 ### Precautions\nGeneral\nAddition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy\n- Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n- There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.\nFluid Retention\n- Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation.\nDizziness and Drowsiness\n- PROMETRIUM Capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. PROMETRIUM Capsules should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime.\nPatient Information\n- General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts.\n- Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe PROMETRIUM Capsules.\nDrug-Laboratory Test Interactions\n- The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy:\n- Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests.\n- Coagulation tests: increase in prothrombin factors VII, VIII, IX and X.\n- Pregnanediol determination.\n- Thyroid function: increase in PBI, and butanol extractable protein bound iodine and decrease in T3 uptake values.\nThe Women's Health Initiative Study\n- In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE  plus MPA  versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age.\n\n【14】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- See BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of PROMETRIUM Capsules on the endometrium was studied in a total of 875 postmenopausal women625 mg conjugated estrogens or placebo.\nEffects on Secondary Amenorrhea - In a multicenter, parallel-group, open label postmarketing dosing study consisting of three consecutive 28-day treatment cycles, 220 premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea were randomized to receive daily conjugated estrogens therapy (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens) and PROMETRIUM Capsules, 300 mg per day (n=113) or PROMETRIUM Capsules, 400 mg per /day (n=107) for 10 days of each treatment cycle. Overall, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions, reported in greater than or equal to 5 percent of subjects, were nausea, fatigue, vaginal mycosis, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness, abdominal distension, acne, dysmenorrhea, mood swing, and urinary tract infection.\n\n【15】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with PROMETRIUM Capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Genitourinary System: endometrial carcinoma, hypospadia, intra-uterine death, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, metrorrhagia, ovarian cyst, spontaneous abortion.\n- Cardiovascular: circulatory collapse, congenital heart disease (including ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus), hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia.\n- Gastrointestinal: acute pancreatitis, cholestasis, cholestatic hepatitis, dysphagia, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, increased liver function tests (including alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased), jaundice, swollen tongue.\n- Skin: alopecia, pruritus, urticaria.\n- Eyes: blurred vision, diplopia, visual disturbance.\n- During initial therapy, a few women have experienced a constellation of many or all of the following symptoms: extreme dizziness and/or drowsiness, blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty walking, loss of consciousness, vertigo, confusion, disorientation, feeling drunk, and shortness of breath.\n- Miscellaneous: abnormal gait, anaphylactic reaction, arthralgia, blood glucose increased, choking, cleft lip, cleft palate, difficulty walking, dyspnea, face edema  feeling abnormal, feeling drunk, hypersensitivity, asthma, muscle cramp, throat tightness, tinnitus, vertigo, weight decreased, weight increased.\n\n【16】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Progesterone (oral) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【17】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- PROMETRIUM Capsules should not be used during pregnancy.\nPregnancy Category B: Reproductive studies have been performed in mice at doses up to 9 times the human oral dose, in rats at doses up to 44 times the human oral dose, in rabbits at a dose of 10 mcg/day delivered locally within the uterus by an implanted device, in guinea pigs at doses of approximately one-half the human oral dose and in rhesus monkeys at doses approximately the human dose, all based on body surface area, and have revealed little or no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to progesterone.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Progesterone (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【18】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Progesterone (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【19】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the milk of nursing women receiving progestins. Caution should be exercised when PROMETRIUM Capsules are administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【20】 ### Pediatric Use\n- PROMETRIUM Capsules are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n\n【21】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing PROMETRIUM Capsules to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to PROMETRIUM Capsules.\n\n【22】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Progesterone (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【23】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Progesterone (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【24】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Progesterone (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Progesterone (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【26】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Progesterone (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【27】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Progesterone (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【28】 ### Administration\nPrevention of Endometrial Hyperplasia - PROMETRIUM Capsules should be given as a single daily dose at bedtime, 200 mg orally for 12 days sequentially per 28-day cycle, to a postmenopausal woman with a uterus who is receiving daily conjugated estrogens tablets.\nTreatment of Secondary Amenorrhea - PROMETRIUM Capsules may be given as a single daily dose of 400 mg at bedtime for 10 days.\n- Some women may experience difficulty swallowing PROMETRIUM Capsules. For these women, PROMETRIUM Capsules should be taken with a glass of water while in the standing position.\n\n【29】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Progesterone (oral) in the drug label.\n- Description\n\n【30】 #IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Progesterone (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 #Overdosage\n- No studies on overdosage have been conducted in humans. In the case of overdosage, PROMETRIUM Capsules should be discontinued and the patient should be treated symptomatically.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- PROMETRIUM (progesterone, USP) Capsules contain micronized progesterone for oral administration. Progesterone has a molecular weight of 314.47 and a molecular formula of C21H30O2. Progesterone (pregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione) is a white or creamy white, odorless, crystalline powder practically insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, acetone and dioxane and sparingly soluble in vegetable oils, stable in air, melting between 126° and 131°C. The structural formula is:\n- Progesterone is synthesized from a starting material from a plant source and is chemically identical to progesterone of human ovarian origin. PROMETRIUM Capsules are available in multiple strengths to afford dosage flexibility for optimum management. PROMETRIUM Capsules contain 100 mg or 200 mg micronized progesterone.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Progesterone (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- PROMETRIUM Capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which is chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. The oral bioavailability of progesterone is increased through micronization.\nAbsorption\n- After oral administration of progesterone as a micronized soft-gelatin capsule formulation, maximum serum concentrations were attained within 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of micronized progesterone is not known\n- Serum progesterone concentrations appeared linear and dose proportional following multiple dose administration of PROMETRIUM Capsules 100 mg over the dose range 100 mg per day to 300 mg per day in postmenopausal women. Although doses greater than 300 mg per day were not studied in females, serum concentrations from a study in male volunteers appeared linear and dose proportional between 100 mg per day and 400 mg per day. The pharmacokinetic parameters in male volunteers were generally consistent with those seen in postmenopausal women.\nDistribution\n- Progesterone is approximately 96 percent to 99 percent bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin (50 to 54 percent) and transcortin (43 to 48 percent).\nMetabolism\n- Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones. Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites. Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the intestine via reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization.\nExcretion\nSpecial Populations\n- The pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules have not been assessed in low body weight or obese patients.\n- Hepatic Insufficiency: The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules has not been studied.\nFood–Drug Interaction\n- Concomitant food ingestion increased the bioavailability of PROMETRIUM Capsules relative to a fasting state when administered to postmenopausal women at a dose of 200 mg.\n- The metabolism of progesterone by human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole (IC50 < 0.1 μM). Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, hence these data suggest that ketoconazole or other known inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the bioavailability of progesterone. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown.\n- Coadministration of conjugated estrogens and PROMETRIUM Capsules to 29 postmenopausal women over a 12-day period resulted in an increase in total estrone concentrations (Cmax 3.68 ng/mL to 4.93 ng/mL) and total equilin concentrations (Cmax 2.27 ng/mL to 3.22 ng/mL) and a decrease in circulating 17β estradiol concentrations (Cmax 0.037 ng/mL to 0.030 ng/mL). The half-life of the conjugated estrogens was similar with coadministration of PROMETRIUM Capsules\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, long-term intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen.\n\n【36】 #Clinical Studies\nEffects on the endometrium\n- In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 358 postmenopausal women, each with an intact uterus, received treatment for up to 36 months. The treatment groups were: PROMETRIUM Capsules at the dose of 200 mg per day for 12 days per 28-day cycle in combination with conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day (n=120); conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day only (n=119); or placebo (n=119). The subjects in all three treatment groups were primarily Caucasian women (87 percent or more of each group) A comparison of the PROMETRIUM Capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group to the conjugated estrogens only group showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia (6 percent combination product versus 64 percent estrogen alone) in the PROMETRIUM Capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group throughout 36 months of treatment.\n\n【37】 - In a single-center, randomized, double-blind clinical study that included premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days, administration of 10 days of PROMETRIUM Capsules therapy resulted in 80 percent of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding within 7 days of the last dose of PROMETRIUM Capsules, 300 mg per day (n=20), compared to 10 percent of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding in the placebo group (n=21).\n- A second multicenter, parallel-group, open label postmarketing dosing study in premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days also evaluated the rate of secretory transformation. All subjects received daily oral conjugated estrogens over 3 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles and PROMETRIUM Capsules, 300 mg per day (n=107) or 400 mg per day (n=99) for 10 days of each treatment cycle. The rate of complete secretory transformation was 21.5 percent and 28.3 percent, respectively.\nWomen's Health Initiative Studies\n- The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) -alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)  compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A “global index” included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These sub studies did not evaluate the effects of CE–alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.\nWHI estrogen plus progestin Substudy\n- For those outcomes included in the WHI “global index” that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.\n- Results of the estrogen plus progestin substudy, which included 16,608 women ,average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3 These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.\n- The estrogen plus progestin Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\n- PROMETRIUM (progesterone, USP) Capsules 100 mg are round, peach-colored capsules branded with black imprint “SV.”\n\n【39】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) .\n- Protect from excessive moisture.\n- Dispense in tight, light-resistant container as defined in USP/NF, accompanied by a Patient Insert.\n- Keep out of reach of children.\n\n【40】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts.\n- Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe PROMETRIUM Capsules.\n\n【41】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Progesterone (oral) interaction has not been established.

Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\nThe pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications\nNo suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\nIt is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e. beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\nAll patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.\nThe following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\nConsideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\nIf the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms .\nFamilies and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Effexor XR should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n【3】 ### Bone Fractures\nEpidemiological studies show an increased risk of bone fractures in patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) including venlafaxine. The mechanism leading to this risk is not fully understood.\n\n【4】 ### Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder\nA major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Effexor XR is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.\n\n【5】 ### Serotonin Syndrome\nThe development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Effexor XR, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).\nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of Serotonin syndrome.\nThe concomitant use of Effexor XR with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Effexor XR should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Effexor XR. Effexor XR should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI .\nIf concomitant use of Effexor XR with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for Serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.\nTreatment with Effexor XR and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\n\n【6】 ### Sustained Hypertension\nEffexor XR treatment is associated with sustained hypertension ,defined as treatment-emergent supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) ≥90 mm Hg and ≥10 mm Hg above baseline for 3 consecutive on-therapy visits .\nAn analysis for patients in Effexor (immediate release) studies meeting criteria for sustained hypertension revealed a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of sustained hypertension for Effexor (immediate release) .\nIn premarketing major depressive disorder studies, 0.7% (5/705) of the Effexor XR-treated patients discontinued treatment because of elevated blood pressure. Among these patients, most of the blood pressure increases were in a modest range (12 to 16 mm Hg, SDBP). In premarketing GAD studies up to 8 weeks and up to 6 months, 0.7% (10/1381) and 1.3% (7/535) of the Effexor XR-treated patients, respectively, discontinued treatment because of elevated blood pressure. Among these patients, most of the blood pressure increases were in a modest range (12 to 25 mm Hg, SDBP up to 8 weeks; 8 to 28 mm Hg up to 6 months). In premarketing Social Anxiety Disorder studies up to 6 months, 0.6% (5/771) of the Effexor XR-treated patients discontinued treatment because of elevated blood pressure. In these patients, the blood pressure increases were modest (1–24 mm Hg, SDBP). In premarketing panic disorder studies up to 12 weeks, 0.5% (5/1001) of the Effexor XR-treated patients discontinued treatment because of elevated blood pressure. In these patients, the blood pressure increases were in a modest range (7 to 19 mm Hg, SDBP).\nSustained increases of SDBP could have adverse consequences. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported in post marketing experience. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before treatment with venlafaxine. It is recommended that patients receiving Effexor XR have regular monitoring of blood pressure. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving venlafaxine, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.\n\n【7】 ### Elevations in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure\nIn placebo-controlled premarketing studies, there were changes in mean blood pressure . Across most indications, a dose-related increase in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure was evident in Effexor XR-treated patients.\nAcross all clinical trials in MDD, GAD, Social Anxiety Disorder and panic disorder, 1.4% of patients in the Effexor XR-treated groups experienced a ≥15 mm Hg increase in supine diastolic blood pressure with blood pressure ≥105 mm Hg compared to 0.9% of patients in the placebo groups. Similarly, 1% of patients in the Effexor XR-treated groups experienced a ≥20 mm Hg increase in supine systolic blood pressure with blood pressure ≥180 mm Hg compared to 0.3% of patients in the placebo groups.\n\n【8】 ### Mydriasis\nMydriasis has been reported in association with venlafaxine; therefore patients with raised intraocular pressure or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (angle-closure glaucoma) should be monitored .\n\n【9】 ### General\nDiscontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine, to include prospective analyses of clinical trials in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and retrospective surveys of trials in major depressive disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of venlafaxine at various doses has been found to be associated with the appearance of new symptoms, the frequency of which increased with increased dose level and with longer duration of treatment. Reported symptoms include agitation, anorexia, anxiety, confusion, impaired coordination and balance, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphoric mood, fasciculation, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, headaches, hypomania, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, sensory disturbances (including shock-like electrical sensations), somnolence, sweating, tremor, vertigo, and vomiting.\nDuring marketing of Effexor XR, other SNRIs (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), and SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.\nPatients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Effexor XR. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate .\n\n【10】 insomnia and nervousness each led to drug discontinuation in 0.9% of the patients treated with Effexor XR in major depressive disorder studies.\nIn GAD trials, insomnia and nervousness led to drug discontinuation in 3% and 2%, respectively, of the patients treated with Effexor XR up to 8 weeks and 2% and 0.7%, respectively, of the patients treated with Effexor XR up to 6 months.\nA loss of 5% or more of body weight occurred in 7% of Effexor XR-treated and 2% of placebo-treated patients in the short-term placebo-controlled major depressive disorder trials. The discontinuation rate for weight loss associated with Effexor XR was 0.1% in major depressive disorder studies. In placebo-controlled GAD studies, a loss of 7% or more of body weight occurred in 3% of Effexor XR patients and 1% of placebo patients who received treatment for up to 6 months. The discontinuation rate for weight loss was 0.3% for patients receiving Effexor XR in GAD studies for up to eight weeks. In placebo-controlled  trials, 4% of the Effexor XR-treated and 1% of the placebo-treated patients sustained a loss of 7% or more of body weight during up to 6 months of treatment. None of the patients receiving Effexor XR in  studies discontinued for weight loss. In placebo-controlled panic disorder trials, 3% of the Effexor XR-treated and 2% of the placebo-treated patients sustained a loss of 7% or more of body weight during up to 12 weeks of treatment. None of the patients receiving Effexor XR in panic disorder studies discontinued for weight loss.\nThe safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Co-administration of Effexor XR and weight loss agents is not recommended. Effexor XR is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.\nWeight loss has been observed in pediatric patients (ages 6–17) receiving Effexor XR. In a pooled analysis of four eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), Effexor XR-treated patients lost an average of 0.45 kg (n = 333), while placebo-treated patients gained an average of 0.77 kg (n = 333). More patients treated with Effexor XR than with placebo experienced a weight loss of at least 3.5% in both the MDD and the GAD studies (18% of Effexor XR-treated patients vs. 3.6% of placebo-treated patients; p<0.001). In a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose outpatient trial for , Effexor XR-treated patients lost an average of 0.75 kg (n = 137), while placebo-treated patients gained an average of 0.76 kg (n = 148). More patients treated with Effexor XR than with placebo experienced a weight loss of at least 3.5% in the  study (47% of Effexor XR-treated patients vs. 14% of placebo-treated patients; p<0.001). Weight loss was not limited to patients with treatment-emergent anorexia .\nDuring the eight-week, placebo-controlled GAD studies, Effexor XR-treated patients (ages 6–17) grew an average of 0.3 cm (n = 122), while placebo-treated patients grew an average of 1.0 cm (n = 132); p=0.041. This difference in height increase was most notable in patients younger than twelve. During the eight-week placebo-controlled MDD studies, Effexor XR-treated patients grew an average of 0.8 cm (n = 146), while placebo-treated patients grew an average of 0.7 cm (n = 147). During the 16-week, placebo-controlled  study, both the Effexor XR-treated (n = 109) and the placebo-treated (n = 112) patients each grew an average of 1.0 cm. In the six-month, open-label MDD study, children and adolescents had height increases that were less than expected based on data from age- and sex-matched peers. The difference between observed growth rates and expected growth rates was larger for children (<12 years old) than for adolescents (≥12 years old).\nTreatment-emergent anorexia was more commonly reported for Effexor XR-treated (8%) than placebo-treated patients (4%) in the pool of short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled major depressive disorder studies. The discontinuation rate for anorexia associated with Effexor XR was 1.0% in major depressive disorder studies. Treatment-emergent anorexia was more commonly reported for Effexor XR-treated (8%) than placebo-treated patients (2%) in the pool of short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled GAD studies. The discontinuation rate for anorexia was 0.9% for patients receiving Effexor XR for up to 8 weeks in GAD studies. Treatment-emergent anorexia was more commonly reported for Effexor XR-treated (17%) than placebo-treated patients (2%) in the pool of short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled  studies. The discontinuation rate for anorexia was 0.6% for patients receiving Effexor XR for up to 12 weeks in  studies; no patients discontinued for anorexia between week 12 and month 6. Treatment-emergent anorexia was more commonly reported for Effexor XR-treated (8%) than placebo-treated patients (3%) in the pool of short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled panic disorder studies. The discontinuation rate for anorexia was 0.4% for patients receiving Effexor XR for up to 12 weeks in panic disorder studies.\nDecreased appetite has been observed in pediatric patients receiving Effexor XR. In the placebo-controlled trials for GAD and MDD, 10% of patients aged 6-17 treated with Effexor XR for up to eight weeks and 3% of patients treated with placebo reported treatment-emergent anorexia (decreased appetite). None of the patients receiving Effexor XR discontinued for anorexia or weight loss. In the placebo-controlled trial for , 22% and 3% of patients aged 8-17 treated for up to 16 weeks with Effexor XR and placebo, respectively, reported treatment-emergent anorexia (decreased appetite). The discontinuation rates for anorexia were 0.7% and 0.0% for patients receiving Effexor XR and placebo, respectively; the discontinuation rates for weight loss were 0.7% for patients receiving either Effexor XR or placebo.\nHyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Effexor XR. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk . Discontinuation of Effexor XR should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.\nSigns and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.\nSSRIs and SNRIs, including Effexor XR, may increase the risk of bleeding events, ranging from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, petechiae, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage to life-threatening hemorrhage. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants or other drugs known to affect platelet function may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.\nPatients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Effexor XR and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.\nClinically relevant increases in serum cholesterol were recorded in 5.3% of venlafaxine-treated patients and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients treated for at least 3 months in placebo-controlled trials . Measurement of serum cholesterol levels should be considered during long-term treatment.\nInterstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine therapy have been rarely reported. The possibility of these adverse events should be considered in venlafaxine-treated patients who present with progressive dyspnea, cough or chest discomfort. Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation, and discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义重复#1#1#与上面内容重复", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:30:15"}

In horses it is a vital component of the clinical examination for colic, to determine the presence or absence of bowel torsion, impaction, or displacement.  Horses undergoing a rectal exam are at relatively high risk of a rectal tear, which can be a life-threatening event, rapidly leading to peritonitis and septic shock.\nThe procedure in dogs and cats is similar to humans.

The knee contains a lateral meniscus and a medial meniscus. Both are cartilaginous tissues that provide structural integrity to the knee when it undergoes tension and torsion. The menisci are also known as 'semi-lunar' cartilages - referring to their half-moon \"C\" shape - a term which has been largely dropped by the medical profession, but which led to the menisci being called knee 'cartilages' by the lay public.\nAlthough menisci are largely associated with the knee, they are similar in function to structures called articular disks in other parts of the body.\n\n【2】 #Anatomy\n\n【3】 #Function\nThe menisci act to disperse the weight of the body and reduce friction during movement.  Since the condyles of the femur and tibia meet at one point (which changes during flexion and extension), the menisci spread the load of the body's weight. This differs from sesamoid bones, which are made of osseous tissue and whose function primarily is to protect the nearby tendon and to increase its mechanical effect.\n\n【4】 #Injury\nIn sports and orthopedics, people will sometimes speak of \"torn cartilage\" and actually be referring to an injury to one of the menisci.\nThe Unhappy Triad is a set of commonly co-occurring knee injuries which includes injury to the medial meniscus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 18:19:38"}

Introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949, it is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory, and states:\nThe theory is often summarized as \"cells that fire together, wire together\", although this is an oversimplification of the nervous system not to be taken literally, as well as not accurately representing Hebb's original statement on cell connectivity strength changes. The theory is commonly evoked to explain some types of associative learning in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength. Such learning is known as Hebbian learning.\n\n【2】 #Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory\nHebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:\nGordon Allport posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:\nWork in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod Aplysia californica.\nExperiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms\n\n【3】 #Principles\nFrom the point of view of artificial neurons and artificial neural networks, Hebb's principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons will increase if the two neurons activate simultaneously; it is reduced if they activate separately. Nodes which tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time will have strong positive weights while those which tend to be opposite will have strong negative weights.  It is sometimes stated more simply as \"neurons that fire together, wire together.\"\nThis original principle is perhaps the simplest form of weight selection. While this means it can be relatively easily coded into a computer program and used to update the weights for a network, it also prohibits the number of applications of Hebbian learning. Today, the term Hebbian learning generally refers to some form of mathematical abstraction of the original principle proposed by Hebb. In this sense, Hebbian learning involves weights between learning nodes being adjusted so that each weight better represents the relationship between the nodes.  As such, many learning methods can be considered to be somewhat Hebbian in nature.\nThe following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (note that many other descriptions are possible)\nwhere  w_{ij}  is the weight of the connection from neuron  j  to neuron  i  and  x_i  the input for neuron  i . Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a Hopfield network, connections w_{ij}  are set to zero if i=j  (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern.\nAnother formulaic description is:\nA variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of Harry Klopf.  Klopf's model reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement.\n\n【4】 #Generalization and stability\nHebb's Rule is often generalized as\n-r the change in the ith synaptic weight w_i is equal to a learning rate \\eta times the ith input x_i times the postsynaptic response y This version of the rule is clearly unstable, as in any network with a dominant signal the synaptic weights will increase or decrease exponentially. However, it can be shown that for any neuron model, Hebb's rule is unstable. Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as BCM theory, Oja's rule, or the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#3#3#Another formulaic description is:\n", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:33:38"}

Mutations that separately abolished interactions at GC boxes II and III while leaving GC box I intact affected the relative utilization of both the major and minor initiation sites as well as transcriptional efficiency of the promoter template in in vitro transcription and transient expression assays. Interaction at GC box IV when the three proximal boxes were in a wild-type configuration had no effect on transcription of the dihydrofolate reductase gene promoter. Thus, GC box interactions not only are required for eficient transcription but also regulate start site utilization in this TATAA-less promoter.\"\n\"A large subclass of polymerase II promoters lacks both TATAA and CCAAT sequence motifs but contains multiple GC boxes. This promoter class includes several housekeeping genes (e.g. the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase  , hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase , hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase , and adenosine deaminase ) as well as nonhousekeeping genes (e.g. the transforming growth factor alpha , rat malic enzyme , human c-Ha-ras , epidermal growth factor receptor , and nerve growth factor receptor  genes).\"\n\"\n\"GC boxes are required for efficient promoter activity in the genes in which they have been analyzed.  in all examined cases, more than one GC box is present.

If present in the promoters of A1BG, these boxes could make transcription easier. The presence of a GC box may indicate a gene silencer especially when a CAAT box is present. Testing these promoters for a GC box and possible interactions with other transcription factors already found increases the likelihood of multiple transcription pathways. At least one GC box has been found between neighboring gene ZSCAN22 and A1BG. The TATA boxes earlier discovered in the distal promoter on this same side may be indicative of a second transcription start site.\n\n【18】 ## Introduction\nMany transcription factors (TFs) may occur upstream and occasionally downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), in this gene's promoter. The following have been examined so far:  AGC boxes (GCC boxes),  ATA boxes,  CAAT boxes,  C and D boxes,  CAREs (GA responsive complexes),  CArG boxes,  CENP-B boxes,  CGCG boxes,  CRE boxes,  DREB boxes,  EIF4E basal elements (4EBEs),  enhancer boxes (E boxes),  E2 boxes,  Factor II B recognition elements,  GAREs (GA responsive complexes),  G boxes,  GLM boxes,  HNF6s,  HY boxes,  Metal responsive elements (MREs),  Motif ten elements (MTEs),  Pyrimidine boxes (GA responsive complexes),  STAT5s,  TACTAAC boxes,  TATA boxes,  TAT boxes (GA responsive complexes),  TATCCAC box,  W boxes (GA responsive complexes),  X boxes, and  Y boxes.\nBut, no  CAAT box,  CENP-B box,  CGCG boxes are too close to ZSCAN22,  no DREB box,  EIF4E basal element,  E2 boxes,  GARE are too close to ZSCAN22,  no G box,  GLM box,  MTE,  TACTAAC box,  TAT box,  TATCCAC box or TATC box,  X box, or  Y box occur.\nInteractions may occur with  an AGC (GCC) box,  an ATA box,  C boxes, a D box, but the other C-box and D-box have not been tested,  CAREs,  CArG boxes,  a CRE box,  enhancer boxes,  a BREu,  HNF6s,  HY boxes,  an MRE,  pyrimidine boxes,  STAT5s,  TATA boxes outside the core promoter, or  W boxes.\n\n【19】 ## Experiments\nRegarding hypothesis 1: GC boxes are not present in the promoter of A1BG.\n\n【20】 Literature searches were performed to determine the likely TFs and possible interactions to transcribe A1BG.\n\n【21】 ### Hypothesis 1\nThere are no GC boxes in the core promoter in the negative or positive directions.\n\n【22】 ### Hypothesis 2\nIf a GC box is present it does not assist in the transcription of A1BG.\nA Google Scholar search using A1BG and GC box produced one result scoring an interaction between SP2 and A1BG only.\n\n【23】 ### Hypothesis 1 discussion\nRegarding hypothesis 1: GC boxes are not present in the promoter of A1BG. There are two GC boxes in the distal promoter in the negative direction: 3'-ACCCGCACCA-5' at 3048 and 3'-ACTCCGCCCA-5' at 3092 nts, negative strand, and their complements. But, there are none on the positive side between ZNF497 and A1BG. Therefore, hypothesis 1 is false. If A1BG can only be transcribed from the positive side promoter, then hypothesis 1 is true.\n\n【24】 ### Hypothesis 2 discussion\nRegarding hypothesis 2: If an GC box is present it does not assist in the transcription of A1BG. In order to assess whether a GC box assists in the transcription of A1BG, pairings of a GC box with other TFs are examined.\nGoogle search 5 results (0.05 sec):\n- A \"GC box  the consensus sequence for binding of the transcription factor Sp l functions to increase transcription levels of promoters containing GC boxes.\" No AGC box or GCC box is mentioned.\n- Some \"putative wound-response elements including AGC box-like sequences28, TCA motif-like sequences28, carrot extensin gene wound-response elements (AT-rich motif, TTTTTTT, TGACGT)29, constitutive PAL footprint and elicitor-inducible PAL footprint31, and proteinase inhibitor II footprint31 have been found in cabch29 promoter.

It may occur at any stage of syphilis. Before the advent of antibiotics, it was typically seen in 25-35% of patients with syphilis. Neurosyphilis is now most common in patients with HIV infection. Reports of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected persons are similar to cases reported before the HIV pandemic. The precise extent and significance of neurologic involvement in HIV-infected patients with syphilis, reflected by either laboratory or clinical criteria, have not been well characterized. Furthermore, the alteration of host immunosuppression by antiretroviral therapy in recent years has further complicated such characterization.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nDuring the Napeoleonic Wars, General Paresis of the Insane(GPI) first appears to be reported in Paris In 1840, Moritz Heinrich Romberg, a german physician was the first who discovered tabes dorsalis which is the most prominent manifestation of neurosyphilis. He described excessive drinking and increase sexual activity may be the causes of tabes dorsalis. He named the disease as progressive locomotor ataxia. He was unable to find the relation between syphilis and tabes doesalis. In 1858, Guillaume Duchenne a French neurologist for the first time described the association between syphilis and neurosyphilis .In 1875, Jean-Alfred Fournier, a French dermatologist conclusively described the syphilis as the main cause of tabes dorsalis. In 1888, Sir William R\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThe forms of presentation of neurosyphilis can be grouped in two categories: early ,asymptomatic which is the most common form, meningealand meningovascular neurosyphilis and late (progressive general paralysis and tabes dorsalis). Other less important forms are gummas, ocular forms of neurosyphilis and syphilitic amyotrophy or hypoacusis\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nNeurosyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that cause syphilis. It usually occurs about 10 - 20 years after a person is first infected with syphilis. Not everyone who has syphilis will develop this complication. Treponema pallidum is usually transmitted via direct contact with the infected lesion (sexual contact) or blood transfusion (rare). The incubation period varies with the size of innoculum (9-90 days). Following transmission, Treponema pallidum uses the intact or abraded mucous membrane to enter the body. It then disseminates to the lymphatics and blood stream to gain access to any organ of the body. Syphilis uses fibronectin molecules to attach to the endothelial surface of the vessels in organs resulting in inflammation and obliteration of the small blood vessels causing vasculitis (endarteritis obliterans). Organism has slow replication rate (30-33 hrs) and evades the initial host immune response. It may seed to different organs of the body especially the cardiovascular system and central nervous system resulting in tertiary syphilis. Different stages of syphilis results from the interaction between the antigen and the host immune response. The initial infection in primary syphilis is limited due to Th1 response and lack of the antibodyresponse. It is speculated that there is a shift from Th1 to Th2 response during secondary syphilis. Cytotoxic T cells and an incomplete humoral immunity response is mainly responsible for persistence of infection and tissue damage in tertiary syphilis. Ineffective type 4 delayed hypersensitivity reaction containing macrophages and sensitized T cells is mainly responsible for the gumma formation in various organs. There is no known genetic association of syphilis. However, neurosyphilis may be associated with the gene polymorphism for IL-10 production with increased levels seen in the patients with neurosyphilis. In neurosyphilis, the brain tissue and preganglionic portion of the dorsal roots of spinal nerves is infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and invasion of treponema pallidum spirochetes to brain tissue and posterior columns of the spinal cord makes them atrophic. The demyelination of the axones of the neurons is the main cause of symptoms and it affects the neuronsin the brain, dorsal root ganglia and posterior columns of the spinal cord.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nNeurosyphilis is a complication of late or tertiary syphilis infection. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infectious disease. The infection damages the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous tissue.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Neurosyphilis from Other Diseases\nNeurosyphilis must be differentiated from other diseases that cause abnormal gait, blindness, confusion and depression, such as multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, CNS abscess, electrolyte disturbance, subdural empyema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain stroke, conversion disorder and drug toxicity.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nNeurosyphilis is not a common disease now because syphilis is usually treated early. In 2012, the incidence of syphilis was estimated to be 6 million cases worldwide. From year 2005 to 2014, the incidence of syphilis in the United States increased from 2.9 to 6.3 cases/100,000/year. The rate of reported cases increased by 15.1% between 2013 and 2014 in the United States. In 2012, the prevalence of syphilis was estimated to be approximately 18 million cases in men and women aged 15-29 worldwide. Among infected patients with Treponema pallidum only 3 to 5% develop neurosyphilis and 5% of those individuals develop tabes dorsalis, 10–20 years later.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThe most potent risk factor in the development of neurosyphilis is HIV infection. Other risk factors include male gender, high serum RPR titer, advanced age, and African American race.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nScreening guidelines for syphilis include all high risk non-pregnant individuals aged 15-65, all pregnant females, men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, and HIV positive individuals. Routine screening of adolescents who are asymptomatic for syphilis is not recommended.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe symptoms of neurosyphilis usually develop secondary to long-term untreated syphilis, and include diplopia, impaired vision, hearing loss, hoarseness, persistent headache, dizziness, vertigo, lightning pains, impaired sensation and proprioception, hypesthesias, hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia, slurred speech and dysarthria. If left untreated, most patients with neurosyphilis may progress to develop paralysis, dementia, Charcot arthropathy, stroke and blindness.\n\n【11】 ### Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe first step laboratory test when there is a clinical suspicious toward neurosyphilis is a venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.\n\n【12】 ### History and Symptoms\nThe late forms of neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis and general paresis) are seen much less frequently since the advent of antibiotics. The most common manifestations today are asymptomatic or symptomatic meningitis. Clinical signs of neurosyphilis (i.e. cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, loss of vibration sense, and auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities) warrant further investigation and treatment for neurosyphilis.\n\n【13】 ### Physical Examination\nPatients with neurosyphilis may be asymptomatic. Physical examination of patients with neurosyphilis is usually remarkable for: Argyll-Robertson pupils, impaired vibratory and proprioception sense, broad base and sensory ataxic gait and positive romberg's test.\n\n【14】 ### Laboratory Findings\nApproximately 35% to 40% of persons with secondary syphilis have asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement, as demonstrated by an abnormal leukocyte cell count, protein level, or glucose level or a  demonstrated reactivity to Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) antibody test on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of neurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis in all instances.\n\n【15】 ### Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with neurosyphilis.\n\n【16】 ### X-ray\nX-rays are not routinely recommended to detect neurosyphilis. However, complications associated with syphilis may be detected incidentally on x-ray. Cardiovascular manifestations of syphilis may be seen as a non-specific widening of the aortic or mediastinal silhouettes on PA and lateral chest x-ray. Linear calcification of the ascending aorta is an almost pathognomonic finding of syphlitic aortitis. This may prompt the clinician to order further imaging studies for confirmation. Additionally, on chest x-ray, secondary pulmonary syphilis may be characterized by the bilateral infiltrates, pleural effusion, subpleural nodules, and lymphadenopathy. X-ray findings may also include osteolytic bone lesions.\n\n【17】 ### Echocardiography and ultrasound\nThere are no echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with neurosyphilis.\n\n【18】 ### CT\nCNS CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Findings on CT scan suggestive of of neurosyoohilis include areas of decreased density suggesting cerebral infarction, syphilitic gumma (appear hypodense with precontrast), focal or diffuse extraaxial enhancement and non-specific white matter lesions.\n\n【19】 ### MRI scan\nSpinal and brain MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Findings on MRI suggestive of neurosyphilis include non specific white matter lesions (cerebral gummas or arteritis), hyperintensity in mesiotemporal lobes, cortical atrophy , cerebral infarction, hippocampal atrophy, hyperintensities in multiple cortical areas and thalami, intramedullary hyperintensity and spinal cord atrophy, longitudinal T2-weighted hyperintensity in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, narrowing between the cervical intervertebral discs and partial ankylosis of the cervical disc space, bilateral high intensity signals on the T2 weighted sequence located in mesiotemporal, insular, frontal regions and calcification of the ligamentum flavum.\n\n【20】 ### Other imaging findings\nOther imaging findings of neurosyphilis include novel PET/CT technology, multimodal ophthalmologic imaging and bone scintigraphy. In PET/CT scan, increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes may be seen. Multimodal ophthalmologic imaging combines ophthalmoscopy with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to produce high definition imaging of the posterior chamber of the eye. Bone scintigraphy allows clinicians to visualize bone uptake of Technetium-99 (T-99m) using x-ray technology.\n\n【21】 ### Other diagnostic studies\nBiopsy may be considered in some cases of neurosyphilis if clinical findings do not correlate with negative serological tests and there is a strong index of suspicion for neurosyphilis.\n\n【22】 ### Medical Therapy\nNo evidence exists to support variation from recommended treatment for early syphilis for patients found to have such abnormalities. If clinical evidence of neurologic involvement is observed (e.g. cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, and symptoms or signs of meningitis), a CSF examination should be performed. Syphilitic uveitis or other ocular manifestations frequently are associated with neurosyphilis and should be managed according to the treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis. Patients who have neurosyphilis or syphilitic eye disease (e.g. uveitis, neuroretinitis, and optic neuritis) should be treated with the recommended regimen for neurosyphilis; those with eye disease should be managed in collaboration with an ophthalmologist. A CSF examination should be performed for all patients with syphilitic eye disease to identify those with abnormalities; patients found to have abnormal CSF test results should be provided follow-up CSF examinations to assess treatment response.\n\n【23】 ### Surgery\nSurgical intervention is not recommended for the management of neurosyphilis.\n\n【24】 ### Primary Prevention\nThere is no vaccine available for prevention of syphilis. However, effective measures for the primary prevention of syphilis include abstinence from intimate physical contact with an infected person, consistent use of latex condoms, limiting number of sexual partners, avoidance of sharing sex toys, practising safe sex, routine screening in pregnant females, individuals with high risk behaviours, and those residing in highly prevalent areas. In patients with diagnosed syphilis, early treatment with penicillin can widely prevent neurosyphilis.\n\n【25】 ### Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention strategies following syphilis include routine screening and follow up in patients with early syphilis to prevent complications, diagnosis and treatment of sexual partners of infected individuals, routine screening, diagnosis and treatment in pregnant females. In patients with diagnosed syphilis, early treatment with penicillin can completely prevent neurosyphlis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#2#2#In 1888, Sir William R没说完\n"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-28 00:16:28"}

IMITREX presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT1B/1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.\nCurrent theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (including substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of IMITREX for the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.\n\n【2】 ### Pharmacodynamics\nBlood Pressure: Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension .\nPeripheral (Small) Arteries: In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance.\nHeart Rate: Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some subjects in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan’s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate.\n\n【3】 ### Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption and Bioavailability: The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% ± 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection.\nAfter a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 ± 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of sumatriptan was (mean ± standard deviation) 74 ± 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a Cmax of 61 ± 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 ± 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The Tmax or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection.\nDistribution: Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL, is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated.\nFollowing a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 ± 8 liters and the distribution half‑life was 15 ± 2 minutes.\nMetabolism: In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive.\nElimination: After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% ± 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% ± 7% as the IAA metabolite.\nAge: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years).\nRenal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined.\nHepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of IMITREX Injection in this population is contraindicated .\nRace: The systemic clearance and Cmax of sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects.\nDrug Interaction Studies: Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors:In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:20:28"}

It has a sweet scent, readily recognised as the scent of newly-mown hay. It has clinical value as the precursor for several anticoagulants, notably warfarin. It is also used as a gain medium in some dye lasers.\nThe name comes from a French word, coumarou, for the tonka bean.\n\n【1】 #Synthesis\nThe biosynthesis of coumarin in plants is via hydroxylation, glycolysis and cyclization of cinnamic acid. Coumarin can be prepared in a laboratory in a Perkin reaction between salicylaldehyde and acetic anhydride.\nThe Pechmann condensation provides another synthesis of coumarin and its derivatives.\n\n【2】 #Derivatives\nSome naturally occurring coumarin derivatives include umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin), aesculetin , psoralen and imperatorin. Coumarin and its derivatives are all considered phenylpropanoids.\n\n【3】 #Coumarin toxicity\nCoumarin is often found in tobacco products and artificial vanilla substitutes, though it has been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century because it is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys, with an LD50 of 275 mg/kg - low compared to related compounds. Although only somewhat dangerous to humans, coumarin is a potent rodenticide: rats and other rodents largely metabolize it to 3,4-coumarin epoxide, a toxic compound that can cause internal hemorrhage and death. Humans largely metabolize it to 7-hydroxycoumarin, a compound of lower toxicity.\nEuropean health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, one of the four species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content.\nCoumarin should be avoided by people with perfume allergy.\nFlexitral (Chantilly, VA) has developed an allergen replacement product called Coumane(TM), GRAS,\n\n【4】 #Compounds\nCompounds within the coumarin family include:\n- brodifacoum, - coumafuryl, and - difenacoum.\n- Ensaculin\n- warfarin\nSeveral of the above compounds are used as rodenticides.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:44", "update_time": "2024-04-27 21:58:20"}

It is noted that neoadjuvant ADT may cytoreduce the prostate volume sufficiently to allow brachytherapy - There may be increased genitourinary toxicity compared with EBRT alone.\n- Brachytherapy should be performed at a center following strict quality-assurance standards.\n- It cannot be determined whether there is an overall or cause-specific survival advantage for brachytherapy compared with EBRT alone, because none of the trials were designed or powered to detect a meaningful difference in survival outcomes.\n\n【5】 Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard for patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and can be considered for those with intermediate-risk disease. 11 Where reported, use and duration of ADT was also summarized.\nEvidence was also collected through a systematic review of the medical literature. Publications were included if they were phase III randomized clinical trials of brachytherapy compared with either EBRT or RP in men with prostate cancer. These publications were identified by rerunning the original strategy in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, for the period from the original search in 2011 through to the end of August 2015.

All five of these trials were randomized; three  were available in fully published form, one 6 was available as both a fully published paper that reported on efficacy outcomes and an abstract 5 that reported on the toxicity outcomes, and one 15 was available in abstract form only. Four 5,12,13,15 of these trials were phase III, and the trial reported by Morton et al 14 was described as being a phase II trial The earliest trial, the fully published phase III trial reported by Sathya et al 13 in 2005, randomly assigned 104 patients with T2 to 3 nonmetastatic prostate cancer to either EBRT (four-field box radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles with a 2-cm margin at 66 Gy total dose given in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks; n 5 53) or brachytherapy boost (iridium implant, 35 Gy over 48 hours) with EBRT (40 Gy, 20 fractions over 4 weeks; n 5 51). Use of concurrent ADT was not reported. Patients were stratified by age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason score, tumor stage (T2 v T3), and risk status (intermediate v high). The primary outcome for this trial was biochemical or clinical failure (which was defined as biochemical failure, clinical failure, or death resulting from prostate cancer), and a statistically significant benefit in favor of the EBRT with brachytherapy arm was detected (hazard ratio 0.42; P 5.0024) after a median reported follow-up of 98 months. 16 While the authors report that the treatment effect was greater in the intermediate-risk group compared with the high-risk group, the difference between the HR for biochemical or clinical failure was not significant; however, when adjusted for age, baseline PSA, Gleason score, and tumor stage, the treatment effect (brachytherapy boost v EBRT alone) was more pronounced (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.58; P 5.0002). No differences in the toxicity profile between the two arms were detected.\nThe second trial, the fully published phase III trial first reported by Hoskin et al 12 in 2007, randomly assigned 220 patients with histologically confirmed T1 to 3 prostate cancer, no evidence of metastases, PSA 50, no previous transurethral resection of the prostate, and fitness for general anesthesia to either EBRT (given as either three-field without shaped blocks  or threedimensional volumetric planning and conformal three-field plans  at 55 Gy given in 20 fractions; n 5 111) or EBRT (35.75 Gy, 13 fractions) with high-dose rate brachytherapy boost (HDR-B; iridium implant delivering a total of 17 Gy in two fractions over 24 hours; n 5 109). Patients were stratified according to tumor stage, PSA levels, and Gleason scores. Neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT (duration not specified) were used in 76% of patients. The primary outcome of interest was biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS), and a statistically significant benefit in favor of the EBRT/ HDR-B was detected (HR, 0.76; P 5.03) after a median follow-up of 30 months. This benefit in favor of the addition of brachytherapy to EBRT was also shown in the comparisons between the tumor stage, PSA levels, and Gleason score groups. No difference was detected in acute toxicity scores between the two arms for grade 2 or higher late bowel or bladder reactions. Health-related quality-of-life scores between the two arms detected a benefit in favor of EBRT/HDR-B (P 5.025) as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate instrument. A second report with a median follow-up of 85 months continued to show superiority of EBRT/HDR-B over EBRT (HR, 0.69; P 5.04). 17 The third trial, a phase III trial, reported in both fully published 6 and abstract form 5 by Morris et al, 5,6 randomly assigned 398 patients with intermediate-and high-risk prostate cancer to either DE-EBRT (whole pelvis EBRT: 46 Gy, 23 fractions followed by conformal EBRT to prostate: 32 Gy, 16 fractions; n 5 200) or LDR-B (whole pelvis EBRT: 46 Gy, 23 fractions followed by an 125 I boost to a minimum dose of 115 Gy to prostate; n 5 198). Patients were stratified by risk category (intermediate v high risk). Twelve months (8 months neoadjuvant, 2 months concurrent, 2 months adjuvant) of ADT was used in all patients. The primary outcome was bDFS as defined by biochemical criteria using the Phoenix (nadir 1 2 ng/mL) threshold. After a median follow-up of 78 months, a statistically significant benefit in favor of EBRT/LDR-B was detected (log-rank P.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed brachytherapy boost (but not risk category) as an independent predictor of bDFS. Assessment of the 5-year cumulative incidence of late grade 3 or higher toxicity detected a significant benefit in grade 3 genitourinary (GU) effects in favor of treatment with DE-EBRT (P.001) but not in grade 4 GU or in grade 3 or higher GI effects. 5 Quality of life was prospectively collected using the Short Form-36 instrument, which assessed physical function, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional and mental health. Additional items to gather data on urinary function, bowel function, and sexual function were added. All items were scored on a scale from 0 to 100. Baselines scores were balanced between treatment arms, but area under the curve differences were detected for bodily pain (P 5.04), general health (P 5.01), sexual function (P 5.02), and urinary function (P 5.006) in favor of treatment with DE-EBRT over LDR-PB. 18 No healthrelated quality-of-life differences were detected for any other domains.\n\n【9】 #UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS\nComprising clinic visits every 6 months until 5 years (yearly thereafter) for prospective collection of patient-and physician-reported adverse effects, complications, and quality of life; PSA and testosterone levels measured every 6 months to assess predefined primary end point of PFS standard nadir 1 2 ng/mL (Phoenix) threshold.\n\n【10】 #COST CONSIDERATIONS\nASCO recognizes that there is often a wide array of choices for treating many cancer types, with often a wide disparity in cost to patients and payers (despite much difference in effectiveness or toxicity). 20 Halpern et al 21 reported that of the radiation modalities used in the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Medicare payer perspective, LDR brachytherapy is the cheapest (compared with SABR, EBRT, or protons). Helou et al 22 showed that in the Canadian health care context, SABR had the higher quality-adjusted life-years and was more cost effective compared with LDR (and both were better than EBRT). Further work is needed to articulate cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility differences between the various prostate cancer treatment approaches.\n\n【11】 #LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH\nThere are four 5,12,13,15 small-to medium-sized RCTs addressing the question of brachytherapy boost. The largest and most contemporaneously relevant (because the control arm used an external beam dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions) trial ,ASCENDE-RT, Morris et al 5,6 has published the survival outcomes; 6 however, the toxicity data are only available in abstract form. When the toxicity data are published, these guidelines recommendations will have to be revised if the toxicities are significantly higher than was presented to date.\nThere are also insufficient data for comment on a meaningful difference in overall survival, because all trials were powered for PFS only. The guideline panel will re-evaluate the recommendations as new data emerge, especially from the ASCENDE-RT and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0232 trials.\n\n【12】 #AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\n【13】 Robert Lee, MD, MS, Med, and Ronald C.

Common adverse reactions include {{{adverseReactions}}}.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is recommended for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Safety and efficacy in other indications have not been established.\n\n【3】 ### Dosing Information\n- When Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is applied to a lesion, a response occurs with the following sequence: erythema, usually followed by vesiculation, desquamation, erosion and reepithelialization.\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream should be applied preferably with a nonmetal applicator or suitable glove. If Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is applied with the fingers, the hands should be washed immediately afterward.\n- Apply cream twice daily in an amount sufficient to cover the lesions. Medication should be continued until the inflammatory response reaches the erosion stage, at which time use of the drug should be terminated. The usual duration of therapy is from 2 to 4 weeks. Complete healing of the lesions may not be evident for 1 to 2 months following cessation of Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream therapy.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorouracil (topical) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorouracil (topical) in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorouracil (topical) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorouracil (topical) in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with either the topical or the parenteral forms of fluorouracil. One birth defect (cleft lip and palate) has been reported in the newborn of a patient using Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream as recommended. One birth defect (ventricular septal defect) and cases of miscarriage have been reported when Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream was applied to mucous membrane areas. Multiple birth defects have been reported in a fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil.\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream. Fluorouracil administered parenterally has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and hamsters when given at doses equivalent to the usual human intravenous dose; however, the amount of fluorouracil absorbed systemically after topical administration to actinic keratoses is minimal . Fluorouracil exhibited maximum teratogenicity when given to mice as single intraperitoneal injections of 10 to 40 mg/kg on Day 10 or 12 of gestation. Similarly, intraperitoneal doses of 12 to 37 mg/kg given to rats between Days 9 and 12 of gestation and intramuscular doses of 3 to 9 mg/kg given to hamsters between Days 8 and 11 of gestation were teratogenic and/or embryotoxic (ie, resulted in increased resorptions or embryolethality). In monkeys, divided doses of 40 mg/kg given between Days 20 and 24 of gestation were not teratogenic. Doses higher than 40 mg/kg resulted in abortion.\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream should not be used in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency. A large percentage of fluorouracil is catabolized by the DPD enzyme. DPD enzyme deficiency can result in shunting of fluorouracil to the anabolic pathway, leading to cytotoxic activity and potential toxicities.\n\n【10】 - Application to mucous membranes should be avoided due to the possibility of local inflammation and ulceration. Additionally, cases of miscarriage and a birth defect (ventricular septal defect) have been reported when Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream was applied to mucous membrane areas during pregnancy.\n- Occlusion of the skin with resultant hydration has been shown to increase percutaneous penetration of several topical preparations. If any occlusive dressing is used in treatment of basal cell carcinoma, there may be an increase in the severity of inflammatory reactions in the adjacent normal skin. A porous gauze dressing may be applied for cosmetic reasons without increase in reaction.\n- Exposure to ultraviolet rays should be minimized during and immediately following treatment with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream because the intensity of the reaction may be increased.\n- Patients should discontinue therapy with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream if symptoms of DPD enzyme deficiency develop .\n- Rarely, life-threatening toxicities such as stomatitis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity have been reported with intravenous administration of fluorouracil in patients with DPD enzyme deficiency. One case of life-threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream in a patient with DPD enzyme deficiency. Symptoms included severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Physical examination revealed stomatitis, erythematous skin rash, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, inflammation of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. Although this case was observed with 5% fluorouracil cream, it is unknown whether patients with profound DPD enzyme deficiency would develop systemic toxicity with lower concentrations of topically applied fluorouracil.\n\n【11】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n- There is a possibility of increased absorption through ulcerated or inflamed skin.\n- Solar keratoses which do not respond should be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up biopsies should be performed as indicated in the management of superficial basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most frequent adverse reactions to Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream occur locally and are often related to an extension of the pharmacological activity of the drug. These include burning, crusting, allergic contact dermatitis, erosions, erythema, hyperpigmentation, irritation, pain, photosensitivity, pruritus, scarring, rash, soreness and ulceration. Ulcerations, other local reactions, cases of miscarriage and a birth defect (ventricular septal defect) have been reported when Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream was applied to mucous membrane areas. Leukocytosis is the most frequent hematological side effect.\n- Although a causal relationship is remote, other adverse reactions which have been reported infrequently are:\n- Emotional upset, insomnia, irritability.\n- Medicinal taste, stomatitis.\n- Alopecia, blistering, bullous pemphigoid, discomfort, ichthyosis, scaling, suppuration, swelling, telangiectasia, tenderness, urticaria, skin rash.\n- Conjunctival reaction, corneal reaction, lacrimation, nasal irritation.\n- Herpes simplex.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): X\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with either the topical or the parenteral forms of fluorouracil. One birth defect (cleft lip and palate) has been reported in the newborn of a patient using Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream as recommended. One birth defect (ventricular septal defect) and cases of miscarriage have been reported when Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream was applied to mucous membrane areas. Multiple birth defects have been reported in a fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil.\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream. Fluorouracil administered parenterally has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and hamsters when given at doses equivalent to the usual human intravenous dose; however, the amount of fluorouracil absorbed systemically after topical administration to actinic keratoses is minimal. Fluorouracil exhibited maximum teratogenicity when given to mice as single intraperitoneal injections of 10 to 40 mg/kg on Day 10 or 12 of gestation. Similarly, intraperitoneal doses of 12 to 37 mg/kg given to rats between Days 9 and 12 of gestation and intramuscular doses of 3 to 9 mg/kg given to hamsters between Days 8 and 11 of gestation were teratogenic and/or embryotoxic (ie, resulted in increased resorptions or embryolethality). In monkeys, divided doses of 40 mg/kg given between Days 20 and 24 of gestation were not teratogenic. Doses higher than 40 mg/kg resulted in abortion.\n- Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant during therapy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Fluorouracil (topical) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Fluorouracil (topical) during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is excreted in human milk. Because there is some systemic absorption of fluorouracil after topical administration , because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue use of the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in pediatric settings.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in geriatric settings.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Fluorouracil (topical) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\n- Topical\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Fluorouracil (topical) and IV administrations.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\n- There have been no reports of overdosage with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream.\n- The oral LD50 for the 5% topical cream was 234 mg/kg in rats and 39 mg/kg in dogs. These doses represented 11.7 and 1.95 mg/kg of fluorouracil, respectively. Studies with a 5 % topical solution yielded an oral LD50 of 214 mg/kg in rats and 28.5 mg/kg in dogs, corresponding to 10.7 and 1.43 mg/kg of fluorouracil, respectively. The topical application of the 5 % cream to rats yielded an LD50 of greater than 500 mg/kg.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In this manner fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency which provokes unbalanced growth and death of the cell. The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate. The catabolic metabolism of fluorouracil results in degradation products ,eg, COz, urea, a-fluoro-(3-alanine) which are inactive.\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- Fluorouracil Cream is a topical preparation containing the fluorinated pyrimidine 5-fluorouracil, an antineoplastic antimetabolite.\n- Chemically, fluorouracil is 5-fluoro-2,4,1H,3H-pyrimidinedione. It is a white to practically white, crystalline powder which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. One gram of fluorouracil is soluble in 100 mL of propylene glycol. The molecular weight of 5-fluorouracil is 130.08 and the structural formula is:\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Systemic absorption studies of topically applied fluorouracil have been performed on patients with actinic keratoses using tracer amounts of 14C-labeled fluorouracil added to a 5% preparation. All patients had been receiving nonlabeled fluorouracil until the peak of the inflammatory reaction occurred (2 to 3 weeks), ensuring that the time of maximum absorption was used for measurement. One gram of labeled preparation was applied to the entire face and neck and left in place for 12 hours. Urine samples were collected. At the end of 3 days, the total recovery ranged between 0.48% and 0.94% with an average of 0.76%, indicating that approximately 5.98% of the topical dose was absorbed systemically. If applied twice daily, this would indicate systemic absorption of topical fluorouracil to be in the range of 5 to 6 mg per daily dose of 100 mg. In an additional study, negligible amounts of labeled material were found in plasma, urine and expired CO2 after 3 days of treatment with topically applied 14C-labeled fluorouracil.\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Adequate long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil. Studies with the active ingredient of Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream, 5-fluorouracil, have shown positive effects in in vitro tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility.\n- 5-Fluorouracil was positive in three in vitro cell neoplastic transformation assays. In the C3H/10T½ clone 8 mouse embryo cell system, the resulting morphologically transformed cells formed tumors when inoculated into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice.\n- Fluorouracil was clastogenic in vitro (ie, chromatid gaps, breaks and exchanges) in Chinese hamster fibroblasts at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 µg/mL and has been shown to increase sister chromatid exchange in vitro in human lymphocytes. In addition, 5-fluorouracil has been reported to produce an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of patients treated with this product.\n- Doses of 125 to 250 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally, have been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats. Spermatogonial differentiation was also inhibited by fluorouracil, resulting in transient infertility. However, in studies with a strain of mouse which is sensitive to the induction of sperm head abnormalities after exposure to a range of chemical mutagens and carcinogens, fluorouracil was inactive at oral doses of 5 to 80 mg/kg/day. In female rats, fluorouracil administered intraperitoneally at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg during the preovulatory phase of oogenesis significantly reduced the incidence of fertile matings, delayed the development of preimplantation and postimplantation embryos, increased the incidence of preimplantation lethality and induced chromosomal anomalies in these embryos. Single dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of 5-fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes (at 500 mg/kg) and to produce abnormalities in spermatids (at 50 mg/kg) in mice.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Fluorouracil (topical) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n\n【37】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 86°F).\n\n【38】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【39】 Rx only\nFluorouracil 5%\nTopical Cream\nFOR TOPICAL USE ONLY - NOT FOR\nOPHTHALMIC, ORAL  INTRAVAGINAL USE\n40 g\nFOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY\nTO OPEN: Remove cap and puncture seal with point on cap.\nApply preferably with a nonmetal applicator or suitable glove.\n\n【40】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be forewarned that the reaction in the treated areas may be unsightly during therapy and, usually, for several weeks following cessation of therapy. Patients should be instructed to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays during and immediately following treatment with Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream because the intensity of the reaction may be increased. If Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream is applied with the fingers, the hands should be washed immediately afterward. Fluorouracil 5% Topical Cream should not be applied on the eyelids or directly into the eyes, nose or mouth because irritation may occur.\n\n【41】 #Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Fluorouracil (topical) interaction has not been established.

However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (IM or IV). Doses of 10 mg may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period.\n- Intravenous infusions should be made slowly over a period of not less than 15 minutes, 30 minutes before beginning cancer chemotherapy and repeated every 2 hours for two doses, then every 3 hours for three doses.\n- The initial two doses should be 2 mg/kg if highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin or dacarbazine are used alone or in combination. For less emetogenic regimens, 1 mg/kg per dose may be adequate.\n- For doses in excess of 10 mg, metoclopramide injection should be diluted in 50 mL of a parenteral solution.\n- The preferred parenteral solution is Sodium Chloride Injection (normal saline), which when combined with metoclopramide injection, can be stored frozen for up to 4 weeks. Metoclopramide injection is degraded when admixed and frozen with Dextrose-5% in Water. Metoclopramide injection diluted in Sodium Chloride Injection, Dextrose-5% in Water, Dextrose-5% in 0.45% Sodium Chloride, Ringer’s Injection, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be stored up to 48 hours (without freezing) after preparation if protected from light. All dilutions may be stored unprotected from light under normal light conditions up to 24 hours after preparation.\n- If acute dystonic reactions should occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly, and the symptoms usually will subside.\n- The recommended single dose is: 10 mg metoclopramide base.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- Metoclopramide 1 mg/kg IV as a bolus preoperatively, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/hour for 9 hours.\n- Oral metoclopramide dosed 30 to 45 mg daily for 7 to 15 days\n- Metoclopramide 10 mg (2 mL) subQ every 6 hours for 3 days (12 doses).\n- Metoclopramide 5 mg provocation test has been used as a diagnostic aid in patients with pheochromocytoma.\n- IV metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours beginning the day of surgery and continuing until the patient could tolerate a regular diet.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Dosing Information\n- If the tube has not passed the pylorus with conventional maneuvers in 10 minutes, a single dose (undiluted) may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period.\n- The recommended single dose is: Pediatric patients above 14 years of age. Pediatric patients (6 to 14 years of age) — 2.5 to 5 mg metoclopramide base; (under 6 years of age) — 0.1 mg/kg metoclopramide base.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g. in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.\n- Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug.\n\n【9】 - Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\n- There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias).\n- Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)\n- Acute Dystonic Reactions\n- Acute dystonic reactions occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses used in prophylaxis of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Cogentin (benztropine mesylate), 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions.\n- Tardive Dyskinesia - Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. :*Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD.\n- Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramide-induced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose.\n- Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn.\n- Parkinsonian-like Symptoms\n- Parkinsonian-like symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, or mask-like facies, have occurred more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment with metoclopramide, but occasionally after longer periods. These symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuance of metoclopramide. Patients with preexisting Parkinson’s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients may experience exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide.\n- Depression\n\n【10】 ### Precautions\n- In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is used in patients with hypertension.\n- Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, certain patients, especially those with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure, may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. If these side effects occur at any time during metoclopramide therapy, the drug should be discontinued.\n- Giving a promotility drug such as metoclopramide theoretically could put increased pressure on suture lines following a gut anastomosis or closure.\n- This possibility should be considered and weighed when deciding whether to use metoclopramide or nasogastric suction in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlates with the dose and duration of metoclopramide administration. The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency:\nRestlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude may occur in patients receiving the recommended prescribed dosage of metoclopramide injection. Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation also may occur. In cancer chemotherapy patients being treated with 1 to 2 mg/kg per dose, incidence of drowsiness is about 70%. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported.\nAcute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. In cancer chemotherapy patients receiving 1 to 2 mg/kg per dose, the incidence is 2% in patients over the ages of 30 to 35, and 25% or higher in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age who have not had prophylactic administration of diphenhydramine. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and, rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine.\nParkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies.\nTardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance.\nMotor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage.\nRare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability.\nGalactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia. Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone.\nHypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure and possible atrioventricular (AV) block.\nNausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea.\nUrinary frequency and incontinence.\nA few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates.\nVisual disturbances. Porphyria.\nTransient flushing of the face and upper body, without alterations in vital signs, following high doses intravenously.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Metoclopramide (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers.\n- Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g. digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g. acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).\n- Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category B\n- Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice and rabbits by the IM, IV, subcutaneous (SC), and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Metoclopramide (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Metoclopramide (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established except as stated to facilitate small bowel intubation.\n- Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations. In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to methemoglobinemia.\n- The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of metoclopramide injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.\n- The risk of developing parkinsonian-like side effects increases with ascending dose. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose of metoclopramide injection that is effective. If parkinsonian-like symptoms develop in a geriatric patient receiving metoclopramide injection, metoclopramide injection should generally be discontinued before initiating any specific anti-parkinsonian agents.\n- The elderly may be at greater risk for tardive dyskinesia.\n- Sedation has been reported in metoclopramide injection users. Sedation may cause confusion and manifest as over-sedation in elderly.\n- Metoclopramide injection is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.\n- For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal function, concomitant disease, or other drug therapy in the elderly.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Metoclopramide (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Intramuscular\n- Oral\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Metoclopramide (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\n- Metoclopramide injection is compatible for mixing and injection with the following dosage forms to the extent indicated below:\n- Physically and Chemically Compatible Up to 48 Hours\n- Cimetidine Hydrochloride , Mannitol, USP (Abbott), Potassium Acetate, USP (Invenex), Potassium Phosphate, USP (Invenex).\n- Ascorbic Acid, USP (Abbott), Benztropine Mesylate, USP , Cytarabine, USP (Upjohn), Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate, USP , Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride, USP (Parke-Davis), Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, USP (Adria), Heparin Sodium, USP (ESI), Hydrocortisone Sodium Phosphate , Lidocaine Hydrochloride, USP (ESI), Multi-Vitamin Infusion (must be refrigerated-USV), Vitamin B Complex with Ascorbic Acid (Roche).\n- (Do not use if precipitation occurs)\n- Clindamycin Phosphate, USP (Upjohn), Cyclophosphamide, USP (Mead-Johnson), Insulin, USP (Lilly).\n- Conditionally Compatible\n- (Use within one hour after mixing or may be infused directly into the same running IV line)\n- Ampicillin Sodium, USP (Bristol), Cisplatin (Bristol), Erythromycin Lactobionate, USP (Abbott), Methotrexate Sodium, USP (Lederle), Penicillin G Potassium, USP (Squibb), Tetracycline Hydrochloride, USP (Lederle).\n- Incompatible\n- (Do Not Mix)\n- Cephalothin Sodium, USP (Lilly), Chloramphenicol Sodium, USP (Parke-Davis), Sodium Bicarbonate, USP (Abbott).\n\n【28】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually disappear within 24 hours.\n- Unintentional overdose due to misadministration has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide syrup. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy.\n- However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal.\n\n【29】 ### Management\n- Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of drug. It is unlikely that dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations.\n- Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue.\n\n【30】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Metoclopramide (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs.\n- In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Metoclopramide hydrochloride is a white crystalline, odorless substance, freely soluble in water. Chemically, it is 4-amino-5-chloro-N--2-methoxy benzamide monohydrochloride monohydrate. Molecular weight: 354.3.\n- Metoclopramide Injection, USP is a clear, colorless, sterile solution with a pH of 2.5 to 6.5 for intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration.\n- This product is light sensitive. It should be inspected before use and discarded if either color or particulate is observed.\n- 2 mL single use vials; 10 mL and 30 mL single use vials\n- Each 1 mL contains: Metoclopramide base 5 mg (as the monohydrochloride monohydrate), Sodium Chloride, USP 8.5 mg, Water for Injection, USP q.s. pH adjusted, when necessary, with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l-dopa or apomorphine which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine.\n- The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose; pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% ± 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hr after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state.\n- In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hr. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide.\n- Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hr. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide.\n- The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues.\n- In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established.\n- There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar.\n- In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER received a metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 mcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 mcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hr), half-life (4.1 hr), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hr, respectively) was significantly longer compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to immature hepatic and renal systems at birth.\n- Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to 9 pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yr) for prophylaxis of cytotoxic-induced vomiting. The metoclopramide plasma concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.4 hr (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hr), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 1.20 L/h/kg), and 3.0 L/kg (range, 1.0 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively.\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- A 77-week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time.\n- An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.\n\n【36】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Metoclopramide (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【37】 #How Supplied\n- Metoclopramide Injection, USP 5 mg metoclopramide base (as the monohydrochloride monohydrate) per mL; available in:\nDo not store open single use vials for later use, as they contain no preservative.\n- This product is light sensitive. It should be inspected before use and discarded if either color or particulate is observed.\n- Dilutions may be stored unprotected from light under normal light conditions up to 24 hours after preparation.\n- Metoclopramide Injection, USP should be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).\n\n【38】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Metoclopramide (injection) Storage in the drug label.\n\n【39】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- A patient Medication Guide is available for metoclopramide injection. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have,\n- Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be cautioned accordingly.\n\n【40】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Metoclopramide (injection) interaction has not been established.

The detection of beta particles or the reactions that include them in an astronomical situation is beta-particles astronomy.\nNotation: let TGF stand for a Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flash.\n\n【1】 #Universals\nA \"clumpiness in the  halo  through a spatially continuous elevation in the density of dark matter, rather than the more realistic discrete distribution of clumps.  the former approach reproduces the average results obtained when considering the essentially infinite set of possible configurations of discrete clumps within the halo. This was demonstrated in the work by Lavalle et al. who deduced that the associated relative variance in the observed positron flux, as a result of the different clump configurations, is proportional to M_c^{1/2}, where M_c is the typical clump mass, and diverges as Ee+ → mχ . It is found that for M_c = 10^6 M_{\\odot} and a universal clump boost factor, Bc ∼ 100, this relative variance is less than 5 per cent for Ee+ ≤ 20 GeV, which is where the positron excess observed by the  HEAT is located. Since the clump mass distribution deduced by Diemand et al. indicates that Mc ∼ 10−6M⊙, it seems very unlikely that such a variance will significantly affect our conclusions, and we use this to strengthen our use of a spatially continuous elevation in dark matter density as a way of acknowledging clumpiness in the galactic halo.\n\n【2】 #Astronomy\nAlthough electron astronomy is usually not recognized as a formal branch of astronomy, the measurement of electron fluxes helps to understand a variety of natural phenomena.\n\"\"lectron astronomy\" has an interesting future\".\n\"Positron astronomy is 30 years old but remains in its infancy.\"\nA High-Energy Antimatter Telescope (HEAT) has been developed and tested in the mid 1990s to measure the positron fraction in cosmic rays.\n\n【3】 #Radiation\nBeta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40. The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation also known as beta rays. The production of beta particles is termed beta decay. They are designated by the Greek letter beta (β).\nThe boundaries are conceptualized as drip lines However, an arbitrary combination of protons and neutrons does not necessarily yield a stable nucleus, and ultimately when continuing to add more of the same type of nucleons to a given nucleus, the newly formed nucleus will essentially undergo immediate decay where a nucleon of the same isospin quantum number (proton or neutron) is emitted; colloquially the nucleon has 'leaked' or 'dripped' out of the target nucleus, hence giving rise to the term \"drip line\". The nucleons drip out of such unstable nuclei for the same reason that water drips from a leaking faucet: the droplet, or nucleon in this case, sees a lower potential which is great enough to overcome surface tension in the case of water droplets, and the strong nuclear force in the case of proton emission or alpha decay\nAs an example, \"he power into the Crab Nebula is apparently supplied by an outflow  of ~1038 erg/s from the pulsar\" where there are \"electrons (and positrons) in such a wind\". These beta particles coming out of the pulsar are moving very close to light speed.\n\"The two conversions of protons into neutrons are assumed to take place inside the nucleus, and the extra positive charge is emitted as a positron.\"\nDef. \"the non-linear scattering of radiation off electrons\" is called induced Compton scattering.\n\n【4】 #Electrons\nThe electron is a subatomic particle with a negative charge, equal to -1.60217646x10-19 C. Current, or the rate of flow of charge, is defined such that one coulomb, so 1/-1.60217646x10-19, or 6.24150974x1018 electrons flowing past a point per second give a current of one ampere. The charge on an electron is often given as -e. note that charge is always considered positive, so the charge of an electron is always negative.\nThe electron has a mass of 9.10938188x10-31 kg, or about 1/1840 that of a proton. The mass of an electron is often written as me.\nWhen working, these values can usually be safely approximated to:\nIt has no known components or substructure; in other words, it is generally thought to be an elementary particle. The intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the electron is a half-integer value in units of ħ, which means that it is a fermion.\n\n【5】 #Delta rays\nA delta ray is characterized by very fast electrons produced in quantity by alpha particles or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of atoms. Collectively, these electrons are defined as delta radiation when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own.\n\"The conventional procedure of delta-ray counting to measure charge .\" Here, the delta-ray tracks in emulsion chambers have been used for \"irect measurements of cosmic-ray nuclei above 1 TeV/nucleon . in a series of balloon-borne experiments\".\n\n【6】 #Epsilon rays\nEpsilon radiation is tertiary radiation caused by secondary radiation (e.g. delta radiation). Epsilon rays are a form of particle radiation and are composed of electrons. The term is very rarely used today.\n\n【7】 #Antimatter\nDef. an elementary subatomic particle which forms matter is called a quark.\nNote: quarks are never found alone in nature.\nDef. the smallest possible, and therefore indivisible, unit of a given quantity or quantifiable phenomenon is called the quantum.\nDef. a subatomic particle corresponding to another particle with the same mass, spin and mean lifetime but with charge, parity, strangeness and other quantum numbers flipped in sign is called an antiparticle.\nA positron differs from a quark by its lack of strong interaction.\n\n【8】 #Nuclear transmutations\nIf the proton and neutron are part of an atomic nucleus, these decay processes transmute one chemical element into another. For example:\n^A_ZN \\rightarrow ~ ^{~~~A}_{Z-1}N' + e^+ + \\nu_e, where A = 22, Z = 11, N = Na, Z-1 = 10, and N' = Ne.\nBeta decay does not change the number of nucleons, A, in the nucleus but changes only its charge, Z. Thus the set of all nuclides with the same A can be introduced; these isobaric nuclides may turn into each other via beta decay. Among them, several nuclides (at least one) are beta stable, because they present local minima of the mass excess: if such a nucleus has (A, Z) numbers, the neighbour nuclei (A, Z−1) and (A, Z+1) have higher mass excess and can beta decay into (A, Z), but not vice versa. For all odd mass numbers A the global minimum is also the unique local minimum. For even A, there are up to three different beta-stable isobars experimentally known. There are about 355 known beta-decay stable nuclides total.\n\n【9】 #Radioactivity\n\n【10】 ^A_ZN \\rightarrow ~ ^{~~~A}_{Z-1}N' + e^+ + \\nu_e.\nPositron emission' or beta plus decay (β+ decay) is a type of beta decay in which a proton is converted, via the weak force, to a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino.\nIsotopes which undergo this decay and thereby emit positrons include carbon-11, potassium-40, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15, fluorine-18, and iodine-121. As an example, the following equation describes the beta plus decay of carbon-11 to boron-11, emitting a positron and a neutrino:\n^{11}_{6}C \\rightarrow ~ ^{11}_{5}B + e^+ + \\nu_e + \\gamma {(0.96 MeV)}.\n\n【11】 #Positroniums\nDef. an exotic atom consisting of a positron and an electron, but having no nucleus or an onium consisting of a positron (anti-electron) and an electron, as a particle–anti-particle bound pair is called positronium.\nBeing unstable, the two particles annihilate each other to produce two gamma ray photons after an average lifetime of 125 ps or three gamma ray photons after 142 ns in vacuum, depending on the relative spin states of the positron and electron.\nThe singlet state with antiparallel spins ( S = 0, Ms = 0) is known as para-positronium (p-Ps) and denoted Template:SubatomicParticle. It has a mean lifetime of 125 picoseconds and decays preferentially into two gamma quanta with energy of 511 keV each (in the center of mass frame). Detection of these photons allows for the reconstruction of the vertex of the decay. Para-positronium can decay into any even number of photons ×10−6.\npara-positronium lifetime (S = 0):\n\n【12】 #Annihilations\nThe positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1e, a spin of ½, and has the same mass as an electron. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron,  annihilation occurs, resulting in the production of two or more gamma ray photons.\nDef. the process of a particle and its corresponding antiparticle combining to produce energy is called annihilation.\nSubsequently, the positron moves randomly through the surrounding matter where it hits several different electrons (e-) until it finally loses enough energy that it interacts with a single electron. This process is called an \"annihilation\" and results in two diametrically emitted photons with a typical energy of 511 keV each. Under normal circumstances the photons are not emitted exactly diametrically (180 degrees). This is due to the remaining energy of the positron having conservation of momentum.\nElectron–positron annihilation occurs when an electron (Template:SubatomicParticle) and a positron (Template:SubatomicParticle, the electron's antiparticle) collide. The result of the collision is the annihilation of the electron and positron, and the creation of gamma ray photons or, at higher energies, other particles:\nThe process  satisfy a number of conservation laws, including:\n- Conservation of electric charge. The net charge before and after is zero.\n- Conservation of linear momentum and total energy. This forbids the creation of a single gamma ray. However, in quantum field theory this process is ; see examples of annihilation.\n- Conservation of angular momentum.\nAs with any two charged objects, electrons and positrons may also interact with each other without annihilating, in general by elastic scattering.\nAt energies near and beyond the mass of the carriers of the weak force, the W and Z bosons, the strength of the weak force becomes comparable with electromagnetism. It becomes much easier to produce particles such as neutrinos that interact only weakly.\nThe heaviest particle pairs yet produced by electron–positron annihilation are  pairs. The heaviest single particle is the Z boson.\nAnnihilation radiation is not monoenergetic, unlike gamma rays produced by radioactive decay. The production mechanism of annihilation radiation introduces Doppler broadening. The annihilation peak produced in a gamma spectrum by annihilation radiation therefore has a higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) than other gamma rays in  spectrum. The difference is more apparent with high resolution detectors, such as Germanium detectors, than with low resolution detectors such as Sodium iodide. Because of their well-defined energy (511 keV) and characteristic, Doppler-broadened shape, annihilation radiation can often be useful in defining the energy calibration of a gamma ray spectrum.\n\n【13】 #Pair production\nThe reverse reaction, electron–positron creation, is a form of pair production governed by two-photon physics.\nTwo-photon physics, also called gamma-gamma physics,  the interactions between two photons. If the energy in the center of mass system of the two photons is large enough, matter can be created.\nIn nuclear physics,  occurs when a high-energy photon interacts with a nucleus. The photon must have enough energy  to create an electron plus a positron. Without a nucleus to absorb momentum, a photon decaying into electron-positron pair ,or other pairs for that matter such as a muon and anti-muon or a tau and anti-tau can never conserve energy and momentum simultaneously.\nThese interactions were first observed in Patrick Blackett's counter-controlled cloud chamber. In 2008 the Titan laser aimed at a 1-millimeter-thick gold target was used to generate positron–electron pairs in large numbers. \"The LLNL scientists created the positrons by shooting the lab's high-powered Titan laser onto a one-millimeter-thick piece of gold.\"\n\n【14】 #Colors\nNotation: WN5 is a component of V444 Cygni, with its Wolf-Rayet (W) spectrum dominated by NitrogenIII-V and HeliumI-II lines and WN2 to WN5 considered hotter or \"early\".\n\"The color temperature of the central part of the WN5 disk for λ < 7512 Å, where the main source of opacity is electron scattering, is Tc = 80,000-100,000 K. This high temperature represents the electron temperature slightly below the surface of the WN5 core--the level at which the star becomes optically thick in electron scattering.\"\n\n【15】 #Minerals\nMany samples of fluorite exhibit fluorescence under ultraviolet light, a property that takes its name from fluorite. Many minerals, as well as other substances, fluoresce. Fluorescence involves the elevation of electron energy levels by quanta of ultraviolet light, followed by the progressive falling back of the electrons into their previous energy state, releasing quanta of visible light in the process. In fluorite, the visible light emitted is most commonly blue, but red, purple, yellow, green and white also occur. The fluorescence of fluorite may be due to mineral impurities such as yttrium, ytterbium, or organic matter in the crystal lattice. In particular, the blue fluorescence seen in fluorites from certain parts of Great Britain responsible for the naming of the phenomenon of fluorescence itself, has been attributed to the presence of inclusions of divalent europium in the crystal.\nExcessive \"26Mg  been reported in meteoritic carbonaceous chondrites  which demonstrate an excess of 26Mg of up to 40% combined with essentially solar concentrations of 24Mg and 25Mg. Many of the data are well correlated with the 27Al content of the samples, and this is interpreted as evidence that the excess 26Mg has arisen from the in situ decay (via positron emission and electron capture) of the ground state of 26Al in these minerals.\"\n\n【16】 #Theoretical beta-particle astronomy\n\"We now assume that the γ-rays are produced  by relativistic electrons via Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (SSC). In any such model, the fact that the γ-rays luminosity, produced via Compton scattering, is higher than that emitted at lower frequencies (1014 - 1016 Hz), supposedly via the synchrotron process, implies a radiation energy density, Ur, higher than the magnetic energy density, UB. From the observed power ratio we derive that Ur must be one order of magnitude greater than UB, which may be a lower limit if Klein-Nishina effects reduce the efficiency of the self-Compton emission. This result is independent of the degree of beaming, which, for a homogeneous source, affects both the synchrotron and the self-Compton fluxes in the same way. This source is therefore the first observed case of the result of a Compton catastrophe .\"\nNotation: let the symbol Ps stand for positronium.\n\"Comparison between direct annihilation and radiative capture to positronium  shows that the two rates are equal at T = 6.8 x 105 K with the former (latter) dominating at the higher (lower) temperatures.\"\nThe process has a related mechanism in atomic hydrogen:\n\n【17】 #Entities\nThere may be a \"connection . between the magnetic field strengths inside an electron, in newly-born pulsars, and the sun, the upper limit to the strength of magnetic field . is that which would permit emission of a photon at the non-relativistic electron gyrofrequency, with the energy of the order of the electron rest mass.\"\nA \"basic process in the formation of pulsar magnetic fields  a variant of electron-positron spin-zero annihilation, as follows where the  arrow represents the magnetic moment of an electron.\nThis relation \"symbolises the formation of a magnetic entity, \\uparrow \\cup \\uparrow, here called an M-particle, with twice the magnetic moment of an electron or a positron, and  represents a photon.\"\n\n【18】 Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) \"have long been suggested as positron sources on theoretical grounds and because their distribution peaks in the bulge region (eg Prantzos, 2004); however, it is only those LMXBs detected at hard X-ray energies that in addition exhibit an imbalance in their disk distribution.\"\n\n【19】 #Objects\n\"It is possible that the X-ray continuum is primary while the radio and optical emission are secondary for all BL Lac objects when the effect of relativistic beaming is considered. Pair production is a possible mechanism for producing X-ray emissions, while the optical and radio emission would be a consequence of this model .\n\n【20】 #Strong forces\n\"The idea behind baryon matter is that a macroscopic state may exist in which a smaller effective baryon mass inside some region makes the state energetically favored over free particles.  This state will appear in the limit of large baryon number as an electrically neutral coherent bound state of neutrons, protons, and electrons in β-decay equilibrium.\"\n\n【21】 #Weak forces\n\"Energy deposit or escape is a major issue in expanding envelopes of stellar explosions, supernovae (positrons from 56Co and 44Ti) and novae (many β+ decays such as 13N)\".\n\n【22】 #Continua\nThe X-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, or what is called inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.\n\"The annihilation of positrons with electrons gives rise to two spectral features, a line emission at 511 keV and a positronium continuum emission (which increases in intensity with energy roughly as a power law up to 511 keV and falls abruptly to zero above 511 keV).\"\n\n【23】 #Emissions\nNotation: let the symbol LAT represent Large Area Telescope.\n\"The observed correlated variability of the GBM and LAT emissions indicates that photons formed co-spatially, with the lower-energy (GBM) photons providing target photons that can interact with higher energy γ rays to produce electron-positron pairs.\"\n\n【24】 #Absorptions\n\"odels in which γ-rays are absorbed in collisions with X-rays producing nonthermal electron-positron pairs, which in turn radiate further X-rays .\"\n\"\n\"he hard X-ray spectrum of a growing number of  AGN  the 1-30 keV X-ray emission has four distinct components\":\n- \"an incident power law spectrum with a spectral index αix ≃ 0.9,\"\n- \"an emission line at the energy ~6.4 keV (interpreted as a fluorescent iron K-line),\"\n- \"an absorption edge at 7-8 keV (interpreted as an iron K-edge), and\"\n- \"a broad excess of emission with respect to the underlying power law at energies ≳ 10 keV (interpreted as Compton reflection from cold  material).\"\n\n【25】 #Bands\n\"For N_s sources located in the field of view, the data D_p obtained during an exposure (pointing) p, for a given energy band, can be expressed by the relation:\"\n\"where R_{p,j} is the response of the instrument for the source j, S_{p,j} is the flux of the source j, and B_p is the background recorded during the pointing p.

Positron interaction with the ejecta  strongly depends on the presence, and geometry, of magnetic fields .\"\n\n【28】 #Cosmic rays\nAluminium-26, 26Al, is a radioactive isotope of the chemical element aluminium, decaying by either of the modes beta-plus or electron capture, both resulting in the stable nuclide magnesium-26. The half-life of 26Al is 7.17Template:E years. This is far too short for the isotope to survive to the present, but a small amount of the nuclide is produced by collisions of argon atoms with cosmic ray protons.\nThere is an \"unexpected rise of the positron fraction, observed by HEAT and PAMELA experiments, for energies larger than a few GeVs.\"\n\"he HEAT balloon experiment  . has mildly indicated a possible positron excess at energies larger than 10 GeV . In October 2008, the latest results of PAMELA experiment  have confirmed and extended this feature .\"\nEarlier measurements indicate that \"the positron fraction,  e+/(e- + e+), increases with energy at energies above 10 GeV. Such an increase would require either the appearance of a new source of positrons or a depletion of primary electrons\n\n【29】 #Neutrals\n\"The positrons can annihilate in flight before being slowed to thermal energies, annihilate directly with electrons when both are at thermal energies, or form positronium at thermal energies (or at greater than thermal energies if positronium formation occurs via charge exchange with neutrals).\"\n\n【30】 #Subatomics\n\"Few exceptional lines arise at high energy from annihilations of positrons and pions.\"\n\n【31】 #Neutrons\n\"Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) hard X-ray (HXR) and γ-ray imaging and spectroscopy observations  of the intense (X4.8) γ-ray line flare of 2002 July 23.\"\n\"For the first time, the positron annihilation line is resolved, and the detailed high-resolution measurements are obtained for the neutron-capture line. The first ever solar γ-ray line and continuum imaging shows that the source locations for the relativistic electron bremsstrahlung overlap the 50-100 keV HXR sources, implying that electrons of all energies are accelerated in the same region. The centroid of the ion-produced 2.223 MeV neutron-capture line emission, however, is located ~20 ± 6 away, implying that the acceleration and/or propagation of the ions must differ from that of the electrons. Assuming that Coulomb collisions dominate the energetic electron and ion energy losses (thick target), we estimate that a minimum of ~2 × 1031 ergs is released in accelerated >~20 keV electrons during the rise phase, with ~1031 ergs in ions above 2.5 MeV nucleon-1 and about the same in electrons above 30 keV released in the impulsive phase.\"\n\"The collisions also produce neutrons, positrons, and pions. Neutron capture on hydrogen and positron annihilation yield narrow lines at 2.223 and 0.511 MeV, respectively, both of which are delayed.\"\n\n【32】 #Protons\nBased on interactions between cosmic rays and the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of 5x1019 eV interact with cosmic microwave background photons \\gamma_{\\rm CMB} to produce pions via the \\Delta resonance, -r\nPions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.\nThe pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron pair production (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about 1017eV. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.\n\n【33】 #Muons\n\"TeV muons from γ ray primaries . are rare because they are only produced by higher energy γ rays whose flux is suppressed by the decreasing flux at the source and by absorption on interstellar light.\"\nMuon decay produces three particles, an electron plus two neutrinos of different types.\n\"The muons created through decays of secondary pions and kaons are fully polarized, which results in electron/positron decay asymmetry, which in turn causes a difference in their production spectra.\"\n\n【34】 #Neutrinos\nThe following fusion reaction produces neutrinos and accompanying gamma-rays of the energy indicated:\nObservation of gamma rays of this energy likely indicate this reaction is occurring nearby.\nIn the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with protons producing neutrons and positrons:\nThe positron quickly finds an electron, and they annihilate each other. The two resulting gamma rays (γ) 511 keV each are detectable. The neutron can be detected by its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The coincidence of both events – positron annihilation and neutron capture – gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.\n\n【35】 #Gamma rays\nMost astronomical gamma-rays may be produced from the same type of accelerations of electrons, and electron-photon interactions, that produce X-rays in astronomy (but occurring at a higher energy in the production of gamma-rays).\nA number of different processes occurring in the universe may result in gamma-ray emission. These processes include the interactions of energetic electrons with magnetic fields.\nThe correlations of the high energy electrons energized during a solar flare and the gamma rays  are mostly caused by nuclear combinations of high energy protons and other heavier ions.\n\"The Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope, (EGRET) measured high energy (20 MeV to 30 GeV) gamma ray source positions to a fraction of a degree and photon energy to within 15 percent. EGRET was developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and Stanford University. Its detector operated on the principle of electron-positron pair production from high energy photons interacting in the detector.  The tracks of the high-energy electron and positron created were measured within the detector volume,and the axis of the V of the two emerging particles projected to the sky. Finally, their total energy was measured in a large calorimeter scintillation detector at the rear of the instrument.\n\n【36】 #X-rays\nX-rays remove electrons from atoms and ions, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this  heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example in molecular clouds only hard x-rays can penetrate and x-ray heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an x-ray source such as a supernova remnant.\nIn an X-ray tube, electrons are accelerated in a vacuum by an electric field and shot into a piece of metal called the \"target\". X-rays are emitted as the electrons slow down (decelerate) in the metal. The output spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum of X-rays, with additional sharp peaks at certain energies characteristic of the elements of the target.\nThe Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope, (EGRET) measured high energy (20 MeV to 30 GeV) gamma ray source positions to a fraction of a degree and photon energy to within 15 percent. EGRET was developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and Stanford University. Its detector operated on the principle of electron-positron pair production from high energy photons interacting in the detector.

Since the refractive index is a function of frequency (and hence wavelength), the intensity does not continue increasing at ever shorter wavelengths even for ultra-relativistic particles (where v/c approaches 1). At X-ray frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than unity (note that in media the phase velocity may exceed c without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as gamma rays) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below those corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonance frequency .\n\"Throughout the shower development, the electrons and positrons which travel faster than the speed of light in the air emit Cherenkov radiation.\"\n\"High energy processes such as Compton, Bhabha, and Moller scattering, along with positron annihilation rapidly lead to a ~20% negative charge asymmetry in the electron-photon part of a cascade . initiated by a . 100 PeV neutrino\".\n\"The tachyonic spectral densities generated by ultra-relativistic electrons in uniform motion are fitted to the high-energy spectra of Galactic supernova remnants, such as RX J0852.0−4622 and the pulsar wind nebulae in G0.9+0.1 and MSH 15-52, Tachyonic cascade spectra are quite capable of generating the spectral curvature seen .

Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms (reduce or increase the number of electrons in them), thus turning it into a plasma, which contains charged particles: positive ions and negative electrons or ions.\nFor plasma to exist, ionization is necessary. The term \"plasma density\" by itself usually refers to the \"electron density\", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The degree of ionization of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled mostly by the temperature. Even a partially ionized gas in which as little as 1% of the particles are ionized can have the characteristics of a plasma (i.e. response to magnetic fields and high electrical conductivity). The degree of ionization, α is defined as α = ni/(ni + na) where ni is the number density of ions and na is the number density of neutral atoms. The electron density is related to this by the average charge state  of the ions through ne =  ni where ne is the number density of electrons.\n\n【43】 #Gaseous objects\nAbove the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m−3 (this is about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level; however, photosphere particles are electrons and protons, so the average particle in air is 58 times as heavy).\n\"Positrons entering a gaseous medium at  are quickly slowed by ionizing collisions with neutral atoms and by long-range Coulomb interactions with any ionized component.\"\n\n【44】 #Rocky objects\n\"Even in small solids and dust grains, energy deposition from 26Al β-decay, for example, injects 0.355 W kg-1 of heat.

Positron annihilation radiation (due to the destructive recombination of a positron and an electron) is emitted as two simultaneous 511 keV gamma rays with 180° angle correlation. By focusing exclusively on the coincident 511 keV events, a drastic reduction of the detected radiation background is achieved, and the non-destructive determination of 26Al in bulk samples of 5-50 g becomes possible.\"\n\n【47】 #Sun\nThe preflare solar material is observed \"to be an elevated cloud of prominence-like material which is suddenly lit up by the onslaught of hard electrons accelerated in the flare; the acceleration may be inside or outside the cloud, and brightening is seen in other areas of the solar surface on the same magnetic field lines.\"\nA coronal mass ejection (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons.\n\"The suprathermal electrons in the solar wind and in solar particle events have excellent properties for this application: they move rapidly, they remain tightly bound to their field lines, and they may arrive \"scatter-free\" even at low energies, and from deep in the solar atmosphere (Lin 1985).\"\n\n【48】 #Coronal clouds\nHelmet streamers are bright loop-like structures which develop over active regions on the sun. They are closed magnetic loops which connect regions of opposite magnetic polarity. Electrons are captured in these loops, and cause them to glow very brightly. The solar wind elongates these loops to pointy tips. They far extend above most prominences into the corona, and can be readily observed during a solar eclipse. Helmet streamers are usually confined to the \"streamer belt\" in the mid latitudes, and their distribution follows the movement of active regions during the solar cycle. Small blobs of plasma, or \"plasmoids\" are sometimes released from the tips of helmet streamers, and this is one source of the slow component of the solar wind. In contrast, formations with open magnetic field lines are called coronal holes, and these are darker and are a source of the fast solar wind. Helmet streamers can also create coronal mass ejections if a large volume of plasma becomes disconnected near the tip of the streamer.\nIn the corona thermal conduction occurs from the external hotter atmosphere towards the inner cooler layers. Responsible for the diffusion process of the heat are the electrons, which are much lighter than ions and move faster.\nThe solar flare at Active Region 10039 on July 23, 2002, exhibits many exceptional high-energy phenomena including the 2.223 MeV neutron capture line and the 511 keV electron-positron (antimatter) annihilation line. In the image at right, the RHESSI low-energy channels (12-25 keV) are represented in red and appear predominantly in coronal loops. The high-energy flux appears as blue at the footpoints of the coronal loops. Violet is used to indicate the location and relative intensity of the 2.2 MeV emission.\nDuring solar flares “everal radioactive nuclei that emit positrons are also produced;  slow down and annihilate in flight with the emission of two 511 keV photons or form positronium with the emission of either a three gamma continuum ,each photon  1012 H cm-3.

The BESA measurements \"show that the planet interacts with the solar wind to form a bow shock and a permanent magnetosphere, The magnetosphere of Mercury appears to be similar in shape to that of the earth but much smaller in relation to the size of the planet. The average distance from the center of Mercury to the subsolar point of the magnetopause is ∼ 1.4 planetary radii. Electron populations similar to those found in the earth’s magnetotail, within the plasma sheet and adjacent regions, were observed at Mercury; both their spatial location and the electron energy spectra within them bear qualitative and quantitative resemblance to corresponding observations at the earth.\"\n\"he Mercury encounter (M I) by Mariner 10 on 29 March 1974 occurred during the height of a Jovian electron increase in the interplanetary medium.\"\n\n【51】 #Venus\nThe first ever X-ray image of Venus is shown at right. The \"half crescent is due to the relative orientation of the Sun, Earth and Venus. The X-rays from Venus are produced by fluorescent radiation from oxygen and other atoms in the atmosphere between 120 and 140 kilometers above the surface of the planet. In contrast, the optical light from Venus is caused by the reflection from clouds 50 to 70 kilometers above the surface. Solar X-rays bombard the atmosphere of Venus, knock electrons out of the inner parts of atoms, and excite the atoms to a higher energy level. The atoms almost immediately return to their lower energy state with the emission of a fluorescent X-ray. A similar process involving ultraviolet light produces the visible light from fluorescent lamps.\"\n\n【52】 #Earth\nWith respect to the rocky-object Earth, between the surface and various altitudes there is an electric field induced by the ionosphere. It changes with altitude from about 150 volts per meter at the suface to lower values at higher altitude. In fair weather, it is relatively constant, in turbulent weather it is accompanied by ions. At greater altitude these chemical species continue to increase in concentration. To dissipate the accumulation of greater charge differential between the surface and the ionosphere, the gases between suffer breakdown (ionization) that permits lightning to be either a draw of negative charge, usually electrons, upward from the surface or a transfer of positive charge to the ground.\n\"ow-altitude regions of downward electric current on auroral magnetic field lines are sites of dramatic upward magnetic field-aligned electron acceleration that generates intense magnetic field-aligned electron beams within Earth’s equatorial middle magnetosphere.\"\nThe ionosphere is a shell of electrons and electrically charged atoms and molecules that surrounds the Earth, stretching from a height of about 50 km to more than 1000 km. It owes its existence primarily to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\n\"Auroras are produced by solar storms that eject clouds of energetic charged particles. These particles are deflected when they encounter the Earth’s magnetic field, but in the process large electric voltages are created. Electrons trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field are accelerated by these voltages and spiral along the magnetic field into the polar regions. There they collide with atoms high in the atmosphere and emit X-rays\".\nAt right is a composite image which contains the first picture of the Earth in X-rays, taken in March, 1996, with the orbiting Polar satellite. The area of brightest X-ray emission is red.\nEnergetic charged particles from the Sun energize electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere. These electrons move along the Earth's magnetic field and eventually strike the ionosphere, causing the X-ray emission. Lightning strikes or bolts across the sky also emit X-rays.\n“One approach for characterizing the sky distribution of positron annihilation radiation is to fit to the data parameterized (and idealized) model distributions, representing the Galactic bulge, halo, and disk.” “Two scenarios for the Galactic dsitribution of 511 keV line emission that remain viable after more than 4 years of observations with SPI\n- bulge + thick disk (BD) and - halo + thin disk (HD).”\nIn 2009, the Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope in Earth orbit observed  intense burst of gamma rays corresponding to positron annihilations coming out of a storm formation. Scientists wouldn't have been surprised to see a few positrons accompanying any intense gamma ray burst, but the lightning flash detected by Fermi appeared to have produced about 100 trillion positrons. This has been reported by media in January 2011, it is an effect, never considered to happen before.\n\"The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detects sudden flares of gamma-rays produced by gamma ray bursts and solar flares. Its scintillators are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the earth. The design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy. The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected gamma rays from positrons generated in powerful thunderstorms.\n\n【53】 #Van Allen radiation belts\nThe Van Allen radiation belt is split into two distinct belts, with energetic electrons forming the outer belt and a combination of protons and electrons forming the inner belts. In addition, the radiation belts contain lesser amounts of other nuclei, such as alpha particles.\nThe large outer radiation belt extends from an altitude of about three to ten Earth radii (RE) or 13,000 to 60,000 kilometres above the Earth's surface. Its greatest intensity is usually around 4–5 RE. The outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by the inward radial diffusion and local acceleration due to transfer of energy from whistler mode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons. Radiation belt electrons are also constantly removed by collisions with atmospheric neutrals, losses to magnetopause, and the outward radial diffusion. The outer belt consists mainly of high energy (0.1–10 MeV) electrons trapped by the Earth's magnetosphere. The gyroradii for energetic protons would be large enough to bring them into contact with the Earth's atmosphere. The electrons here have a high flux and at the outer edge (close to the magnetopause), where geomagnetic field lines open into the geomagnetic \"tail\", fluxes of energetic electrons can drop to the low interplanetary levels within about 100 km (a decrease by a factor of 1,000).\n\n【54】 #Moon\nThe electron reflectometer (ER) aboard the Lunar Prospector determines the location and strength of magnetic fields from the energy spectrum and direction of electrons. The instrument measures the pitch angles of solar wind electrons reflected from the Moon by lunar magnetic fields. Stronger local magnetic fields can reflect electrons with larger pitch angles. Field strengths as small as 0.01  nT could be measured with a spatial accuracy of about 3 km (1.9 mi) at the lunar surface.\n\"he shadowed lunar surface charges negative.\"\n\n【55】 #Mars\n\"uminescence dating techniques  provide absolute age determinations of eolian sediments on the surface of Mars, including those incorporated in the martian polar ice caps. Fundamental thermally and optically stimulated luminescence properties of bulk samples of JSC Mars-1 soil simulant . The radiation-induced luminescence signals (both thermoluminescence, TL, and optically stimulated luminescence, OSL) from JSC Mars-1 are found to have a wide dynamic dose–response range, with the luminescence increasing linearly to the highest doses used (936 Gy), following irradiation with 90Sr/90Y beta particles.\"\n\n【56】 #Jupiter\nThe image at right represents \"he Jovian magnetosphere , including the Io flux tube , Jovian aurorae, the sodium cloud , and sulfur torus .\"\n\"Io may be considered to be a unipolar generator which develops an emf  of 7 x 105 volts across its radial diameter (as seen from a coordinate frame fixed to Jupiter).\"\n\"This voltage difference is transmitted along the magnetic flux tube which passes through Io, The current  must be carried by keV electrons which are electrostatically accelerated at Io and at the top of Jupiter's ionosphere.\"\n\"Io's high density (4.1 g cm-3) suggests a silicate composition. A reasonable guess for its electrical conductivity might be the conductivity of the Earth's upper mantle, 5 x 10-5 ohm-1 cm-1 (Bullard 1967).\"\nAs \"a conducting body  a magnetic field  produces an induced electric field, The Jupiter-Io system . operates as a unipolar inductor\" .

This spectral character is sufficiently distinct from the much softer solar and magnetospheric electron spectra that it has been used as a spectral filter to separate Jovian electrons from other sources . A second Jovian electron characteristic is that such electrons in the interplanetary medium tend to consist of flux increases of several days duration which recur with 27 day periodicities . A third feature of Jovian electrons at 1 AU is that the flux increases exhibit a long-term modulation of 13 months which is the synodic period of Jupiter as viewed from Earth\".\nJovian electrons propagate \"along the spiral magnetic field of the interplanetary medium \".\n\n【57】 #Callisto\nAt right is a complete global color image of Callisto. Bright scars on a darker surface testify to a long history of impacts on Jupiter's moon Callisto. The picture, taken in May 2001, is the only complete global color image of Callisto obtained by Galileo, which has been orbiting Jupiter since December 1995. Of Jupiter's four largest moons, Callisto orbits farthest from the giant planet. Callisto's surface is uniformly cratered but is not uniform in color or brightness. Scientists believe the brighter areas are mainly ice and the darker areas are highly eroded, ice-poor material.\nCallisto's ionosphere was first detected during Galileo flybys; its high electron density of 7–17 x 104 cm−3 cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone.\n\n【58】 #Saturn\n\"agnetospheric electron (bi-directional) beams connect to the expected locations of Saturn’s aurora\".\nPowered by the Saturnian equivalent of (filamentary) Birkeland currents, streams of charged particles from the interplanetary medium interact with the planet's magnetic field and funnel down to the poles. Double layers are associated with (filamentary) currents, and their electric fields accelerate ions and electrons.\n\n【59】 #Heliospheres\nThese electrons \"provide remote-sensing observations of distant targets in the heliosphere - the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter, and various heliospheric structures.\"\n\n【60】 #Interstellars\n\n【61】 \"In the first 18 months of operations, AMS-02  recorded 6.8 million positron (an antimatter particle with the mass of an electron but a positive charge) and electron events produced from cosmic ray collisions with the interstellar medium in the energy range between 0.5 giga-electron volt (GeV) and 350 GeV. These events were used to determine the positron fraction, the ratio of positrons to the total number of electrons and positrons. Below 10 GeV, the positron fraction decreased with increasing energy, as expected. However, the positron fraction increased steadily from 10 GeV to 250 GeV. This increase, seen previously though less precisely by instruments such as the Payload for Matter/antimatter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, conflicts with the predicted decrease of the positron fraction and indicates the existence of a currently unidentified source of positrons, such as pulsars or the annihilation of dark matter particles. Furthermore, researchers observed an unexpected decrease in slope from 20 GeV to 250 GeV. The measured positron to electron ratio is isotropic, the same in all directions.\"\n\n【62】 #X-ray novas\n\"The day after its discovery by the Watch instrument, the X-ray nova GRS 1124-684 in Musca was detected by the soft γ-ray telescope SIGMA at the limit of its field of view.  an emission feature around 500 keV in the source spectrum during one postflare observation  is  first clear evidence of γ-ray line emission from soft X-ray transients, and,  interpreted as a positron annihilation line\".\n\n【63】 #Cygnus X-1\nIn \"a 10 keV to 1 MeV X-ray spectrum of Cyg X-1 in its low state, accumulated over ≡3 months in 1977 and 1978.

However, it seems likely, on the basis of evidence presented herein, that the energy of the peak is not at 0.511 MeV (unless the radiation is redshifted by ~0.07 in energy).\".\nMore recent measurements from 1979 through 2003 with germanium detectors observed the peak at 511 keV. \" single point source is inconsistent with the data. Formally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the emission originates in at least 2 point sources.\"\n\n【65】 #Seyfert 1 coronas\n\"On the basis of spectroscopic observations, the leading models of the X-ray continuum production are based on a hot, Comptonizing electron or electron-positron pair corona close to the black hole.\"\n\n【66】 #Geography\n\"The Earth’s magnetic field significantly affects the CR distribution in near-Earth space. At energies below 10 GeV, a significant fraction of the incoming particles are deflected back to interplanetary space by the magnetic field (“geomagnetic cutoff”). The exact value of the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity depends on the detector position and viewing angle. In addition to the geomagnetic cutoff effect, the Earth blocks trajectories for particles of certain rigidities and directions while allowing other trajectories. This results in a different rate of CRs from the east than the west (the “east-west effect”) .\"\n\"Positive charges propagating toward the east are curved outward, while negative charges are curved inward toward the Earth  This results in a region of particle directions from which positrons can arrive, while electrons are blocked by the Earth. At each particle rigidity there is a region to the west from which positrons are allowed and electrons are forbidden. There is a corresponding region to the east from which electrons are allowed and positrons are forbidden. The precise size and shape of these regions depend on the particle rigidity and instrument location.\"\n\n【67】 #Technology\n\"The GAMMA-400 space observatory will provide precise measurements of gamma rays, electrons, and positrons in the energy range 0.1–3000 GeV.\"\n\n【68】 #Balloons\nMeasurements \"of the cosmic-ray positron fraction as a function of energy have been made using the High-Energy Antimatter Telescope (HEAT) balloon-borne instrument.\"\n\"The first flight took place from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The second flight  from Lynn Lake, Manitoba, \".\n\n【69】 #Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\n\"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair-conversion gamma-ray telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope satellite. It has been used to measure the combined  CR electron and positron spectrum from 7 GeV to 1 TeV . The LAT does not have a magnet for charge separation. However, as pioneered by  and , the geomagnetic field can also be used to separate the two species without an onboard magnet. Müller and Tang  used the difference in geomagnetic cutoff for positrons and electrons from the east and west to determine the positron fraction between 10 GeV and 20 GeV. As reported below, we used the shadow imposed by the Earth and its offset direction for electrons and positrons due to the geomagnetic field, to separately measure the spectra of CR electrons and positrons from 20 GeV to 200 GeV. In this energy range, the 68% containment radius of the LAT point-spread function is 0.1° or better and the energy resolution is 8% or better.\"\n\n【70】 #GRANAT\nThe GRANAT satellite has aboard the  γ-ray telescope SIGMA which on \"January 9  detected Nova Muscae at the very edge of its field of view (FOV).\"\n\"SIGMA provides high-resolution (≈ 15') images of the sky in the 35-1300 keV band .\"\nGranat discovered the electron/positron annihilation line (511 keV) from the galactic microquasar 1E1740-294 and the GRS 1124-683 (X-ray Nova Muscae).\n\n【71】 #INTEGRAL\n\"ositron astronomy results . have been obtained using the INTEGRAL spectrometer SPI\".

However, the following interactions have been noted with the individual components of SIMCOR:\nSimvastatin\n\n【2】 ## Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Cyclosporine, or Danazol\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Simvastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of CYP3A4.  is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nElevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher doses of SIMCOR . Concomitant use of drugs labeled as having a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is contraindicated . If treatment with itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin or telithromycin is unavoidable, therapy with SIMCOR must be suspended during the course of treatment.\nAlthough not studied clinically, voriconazole has been shown to inhibit lovastatin metabolism in vitro (human liver microsomes).\nCyclosporine or Danazol: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of cyclosporine or danazol. Therefore, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated .\n\n【3】 ## Verapamil or Diltiazem\nThe risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of verapamil or diltiazem with doses of  exceeding 10 mg. Because all doses of SIMCOR contain  in excess of 10 mg, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated .\n\n【4】 ## Lipid-Lowering Drugs That Can Cause myopathy When Given Alone\nGemfibrozil: Contraindicated with SIMCOR .

Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately when SIMCOR is initiated.\n\n【8】 ## Coumarin Anticoagulants\nIn normal volunteers and hypercholesterolemic patients,  20-40 mg/day modestly potentiated the effect of coumarin anticoagulants since the prothrombin time, reported as International Normalized Ratio (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 3.4 in the volunteers and patients, respectively. With other reductase inhibitors, clinically evident bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time has been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly. In such patients, prothrombin time should be determined before starting SIMCOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the dose of SIMCOR is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be repeated.\n\n【9】 ## Colchicine\nCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with  coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing SIMCOR with colchicine .\nniacin\n\n【10】 ## Aspirin\nConcomitant use of aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of niacin.

It possesses anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. In the United Kingdom, it was known as Quinalbarbitone.\n\n【1】 #Indications\nSecobarbital is indicated for:\n- Treatment of epilepsy\n- Temporary treatment of insomnia in patients resistant to mainstream hypnotics\n- Use as a preoperative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful.\n\n【2】 #Availability\nIt is available as either a free acid or a sodium salt. The free acid is a white amorphous powder that is slightly soluble in water and very soluble in ethanol. The salt is a white hygroscopic powder that is soluble in water and ethanol.\n\n【3】 ### Secobarbital sodium\nThe sodium salt of secobarbital is classified separately from the free acid, as follows:\n\n【4】 - Chemical formula: C12H18N2NaO3\n- Molecular weight: 260.265\n\n【5】 #Side effects\nSide effects of secobarbital include:\n- Somnolence\n- Impaired motor functions\nImpaired coordination\nDizziness\n- Anxiety\n- Confusion\n- Agitation, irritability, or excitability\n- Headache\n- Nausea - Vomiting\n- Nightmares\n- Increased sensitivity to pain\n- Allergic reactions\nDifficulty breathing\nEdema\nUrticaria\n\n【6】 #Withdrawal\nSecobarbital is a fairly addictive drug, and withdrawal symptoms can occur if long-term usage is abruptly ended. Withdrawal symptoms can include:\n- Anxiety\n- Death\n- Insomnia - Lack of appetite\n- Seizures\n- Tremors\n\n【7】 #Recreational Use\nSecobarbital began to be widely abused in the 1960s and 1970s, although with the advent of benzodiazepines, they have become less commonly used.\nSecobarbital has acquired many nicknames, the most common being \"reds\", or \"red dillies\" (it was originally packaged in red capsules). Another common nickname is \"seccies\". A less common nickname is \"dolls\"; this was partly responsible for the title of Jacqueline Susann's novel Valley of the Dolls, whose main characters use secobarbital and other such drugs.\nAnother popular brand of barbiturate pill Tuinal contained a combination of secobarbital and amobarbital but is now rarely prescribed due to problems with abuse and overdose.\n\n【8】 ## Cause of Death of Charles Boyer\nTwo days after his wife died from cancer in 1978, Charles Boyer committed suicide with an overdose of Seconal.\n\n【9】 ## Cause of Death of Bartley Crum\nBartley Crum was the attorney for some of the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" who were subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. The FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and shadowed him constantly. Labeled as subversive, he ended up losing most of his clients and, unable to cope with stress from the harassment, committed suicide in 1959 by washing down an entire bottle of Seconal with whisky.\n\n【10】 ## Cause of Death of Judy Garland\nJudy Garland, of \"The Wizard of Oz\" fame, was found dead in her bathroom by her husband Mickey Deans on June 22, 1969. The stated exact cause of death by coroner Gavin Thursdon was accidental overdose of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of 10 1.5-grain Seconal capsules.\n\n【11】 ## Role in Death of Jimi Hendrix\nSecobarbital played a role in the September 18, 1970 death of legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who purportedly took nine Secobarbital tablets after a night of drinking wine and was later found dead in his London apartment.  Hendrix' death was caused by asphyxiation, after Hendrix presumably vomited in his sleep as a result of the mixture of the excessive Secobarbital dose and alcohol.\n\n【12】 ## Role in Death of Anissa Jones\nAnissa Jones' fatal overdose was of a combination of cocaine, PCP, Methaqualone, and Seconal. The San Diego County coroner said it was one of the most severe cases of drug overdose ever seen in San Diego County.\n\n【13】 ## Cause of Death of Carol Landis\nOn July 5, 1948, Carole Landis committed suicide by taking an overdose of Seconal in her Brentwood Heights, California home.\n\n【14】 ## Cause of Death of Marilyn Monroe\nIn March 2007, an LA-based Australian writer and director named Philippe Mora uncovered previously-classified government documents regarding Marilyn Monroe's death. These documents, in turn, cited Seconal as Monroe's barbiturate of choice for her alleged suicide.\n\n【15】 ## Cause of Death of Alejandra Pizarnik\nAlejandra Pizarnik, an Argentine poetess, reportedly died, in 1972 at the age of 36, from a self-induced overdose of seconal.\n\n【16】 ## Cause of Death of Lupe Velez\nLupe Velez, a Mexican actress who starred in many Hollywood films from 1927 to her death in 1944.  On December 13, 1944 she committed suicide with an overdose of Seconal. She was 36 years old.\n\n【17】 #Use as a lethal injection\nSecobarbital overdose was the most common method of implementing physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in Oregon until Eli Lilly and Company discontinued manufacturing it in May 2001, leading to a shortage of the drug. Since then, pentobarbital has dominated in Oregon PAS.

Parts of the body with cartilage, and therefore potentially affected by polychondritis, include the ears, nose, throat, heart valves and of course all areas where musculo-skeletal tissues are connected by cartilage.  Specific resultant conditions may include Type 3 Tracheomalacia and Vasculitis.\nReasons for disease onset are not known.  Treatment plans typically involve suppression of the immune system with medicines, which often result in a side effect of increasing the risk of other infections.\nWhile the disease can come on at various times, most frequent time for onset is in the late 40's to early 50's.  Some literature reports a slightly higher occurrence in females than males, while other literature asserts that sex is apparently not a statistically significant factor in the occurrence rate of the disease.

This recommendation report may also be useful in informing clinical decision making regarding the appropriate role of PET imaging and in guiding priorities for future PET imaging research.\n\n【1】 #RECOMMENDATIONS AND KEY EVIDENCE\nThese recommendations are based on an evidentiary foundation consisting of one recent high-quality U.K. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) systematic review  that included systematic review and primary study literature for the period from 2000 to August 2005 and update searches based on those in that systematic review undertaken to retrieve the same level of evidence for the period from August 2005 to May 2010.\nThe routine use of PET is not recommended for the diagnosis or staging of clinical Stage I-III colorectal cancers. PET is recommended for determining management and prognosis if conventional imaging is equivocal for the presence of metastatic disease. Diagnosis PET: One systematic review of two primary studies and one additional primary study in the 2007 Health Technology Assessment (HTA) review  summarized the fact that PET has good sensitivity to detect primary tumours > 2 cm, but not smaller tumours, with variable specificity. No additional studies were identified in the update searches. PET/CT: No studies of PET/CT for diagnosis were identified.\nPET: Two primary studies in the HTA review , and four studies from the update searches ,Furukawa et al Llamas-Elvira et al Nahas et al and Kosugi et al were identified. These studies had different patient case mixes and proportions of patients with stage IV disease. While some studies showed changes in patient management because of changes in M-staging, such findings were in studies with a relatively large proportion of stage IV disease. Furukawa et al  and Nahas et al  did not show any significant changes in Mstaging. Kosugi et al  included 53 patients with lymph node metastases on CT. PET detected 24 para-aortic and 29 epicolic/paracolic/or intermediate lymph nodes. The results of Kosugi et al  showed that PET has lower sensitivity, higher specificity, higher accuracy and higher positive value (PPV) than CT for N1 and N2-3 lymph nodes. For N4 lymph node, PET has high sensitivity and high specificity, while CT has only high sensitivity but low specificity and low PPV. Thus, it is reasonable to consider using PET when N4 nodes are suspected.\nThe HTA review did not identify any studies that involved the use of PET/CT exclusively for staging prior to any therapy. The 2005-2008 update search identified five studies ,Veit-Haibach et al Park et al Kinner et al Tsunoda et al and Orlacchio et al. Park et al  included only patients with equivocal CT findings or elevated carcinoembryonic enzyme (CEA), which resulted in 49% stage IV patients. PET/CT changed the management in 24% of those patients. Tsunoda et al  evaluated the detection rate of PET/CT with respect to nodal metastasis (proximal and distal). PET/CT had better performance than CT overall. Given the small proportion of patients with distant nodal metastasis plus the fact that the study did not separately compare PET/CT and CT with respect to distant nodal metastasis only, it is difficult to know whether distant nodal Mstaging is changed significantly with the use of PET/CT. Veit-Haibach et al  and Kinner et al  did not show a significant change in M-staging. In Orlacchio et al , which included 467 patients, there was concordance among PET, CT, and PET/CT in 91.2% of the cases. Seventytwo percent (72%) of the cases were true positive for liver metastases, suggesting the patients in the study had a higher index of suspicion for liver metastases than might be expected in the routine clinical setting. The study provided formal statistical Z test comparison which showed that PET/CT is better than PET alone or CT alone with p-values < 0.05. The sensitivity and specificity were all greater than 90% in CT, PET, and PET/CT.\n\n【2】 #Qualifying Statements\nSome studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of PET or PET/CT with respect to each metastatic site/organ/lesion, while some evaluated it with respect to the M-staging of each patient. It would appear that studies that analyzed results based on each site/organ/lesion showed a better performance of PET or PET/CT, while studies that analyzed results based on the overall M-staging of patients did not show an obvious improvement in performance of PET or PET/CT. As solitary or oligo-metastasis is not a very common presentation in the initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer, it would be unlikely that PET or PET/CT would detect such a situation when CT missed it, if the objective was to change the M-staging and management of these patients. However, in patients who already have suspicious or confirmed metastasis based on CT, it is quite possible that PET or PET/CT could detect further metastases in other sites/organs that were not conclusively detected by CT alone. This would inflate the diagnostic performance of PET or PET/CT, if an analysis was based on sites/organs/lesions instead of the overall M-staging of each patient. This factor might be important when making recommendations for early-stage disease versus metastatic disease.\nOn the other hand, for patients who already have what appears to be solitary or oligometastases on CT only, and who are potential candidates for resection, and given that the possibility of further metastasis in other sites/organs is not low, PET or PET/CT might assist in the decision making of resection with curative intent by helping to assess the extent of metastasis. Studies that analyzed the diagnostic performance of PET or PET/CT, with respect to sites/organs/lesions, provided evidence to support this approach. Therefore, there may be a role for the use of PET or PET/CT when conventional imaging raises suspicion of the presence of potentially resectable metastatic disease, and patients are potential candidates to undergo such surgery. The incremental benefit of PET or PET/CT over magnetic resonance imaging  of the liver is unclear in such populations as none of the studies included the routine use of MRI as part of conventional imaging.\nMost studies that showed that PET or PET/CT changed the management of a significant proportion of patients included a relatively large number with stage IV disease (up to 46% of patients). Studies that included a relatively small proportion of stage IV patients did not appear to show a significant benefit or change in the patient management plan with PET or PET/CT. Some of those changes in management involved the detection of a larger than expected volume of disease in the liver or extrahepatic metastasis by PET or PET/CT in patients originally diagnosed with low-volume resectable liver metastasis by conventional imaging.\nIt is unclear whether PET or PET/CT leads to an improvement in survival or simply results in stage migration. Nonetheless, many practitioners may accept that more accurate staging will lead to a better choice of treatment plan, thereby avoiding overtreatment and sparing patients the unnecessary risks or side effects of therapy or avoiding undertreatment when patients might otherwise benefit from aggressive curative-intent therapy.\nThere are very few studies that evaluated rectal cancer and colon cancer separately. The current limited evidence did not obviously suggest or refute that PET or PET/CT significantly changed management in patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer. However, some studies seemed to suggest that PET or PET/CT has better N-stage accuracy than CT. It is unclear how PET or PET/CT compares with MRI or trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) with respect to N-staging. There may be a role for PET/CT with respect to Nstaging in the decision making for patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer who might be candidates for preoperative chemoradiotherapy. When conventional imaging with CT suggests equivocal para-aortic lymph node involvement as the only potential site of concern and that the patient is otherwise a potential candidate for curative intent surgery of the primary colorectal cancer, PET can be considered in order to rule in or out para-aortic region metastatic disease.\n\n【3】 #Assessment of Treatment Response\nHowever, one-time PET after preoperative therapy poorly predicted complete pathologic response after preoperative therapy in Capirci et al  and Kalff et al  and poorly predicted posttherapy staging in Capirci et al . Glazer et al  conducted a prospective cohort study of 138 patients, each with presumptive diagnosis of liver metastasis, who had at least one PET scan after chemotherapy and before liver resection. The study showed that ultrasonography also guides surgical decision during intraoperative assessment and suggested PET after chemotherapy should not be used in decision making for liver resection.\nPET/CT: The HTA review did not have any studies of PET/CT in predicting treatment response. The update searches identified 2 studies ,Capirci et al, 2007 Kristiansen et al, 2008. Capirci et al  suggested that a change in SUV before and after preoperative chemoradiotherapy predicted a tumour regression grade (TRG) in rectal cancer, while Kristiansen et al  suggested a single PET/CT after preoperative therapy poorly predicted complete pathologic response.\n\n【4】 #Qualifying Statements\nRecurrence/Restaging PET is not recommended for routine surveillance in patients with colorectal cancer treated with curative surgery at high risk for recurrence. PET is recommended to determine the site of recurrence in the setting of rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) when a conventional workup fails to unequivocally identify metastatic disease.\nHTA review  : One systematic review with 13 primary studies and two additional primary studies showed that PET had a sensitivity for detecting recurrence of ≥ 85% and specificities varying from 43% to 90%. Accuracy and sensitivity were superior to CT and similar to MRI. Two studies noted that PET's ability to detect lesions < 1 cm was poor.\nThe update searches identified one RCT ,Sobhani et al, 2008, which evaluated the role of PET in surveillance of colorectal cancer in patients who underwent curative surgery and were at high risk for recurrence. Overall, there was no difference in recurrence rate with the addition of PET to conventional workup, but there was a significant improvement in the time to detection of recurrence and in the numbers of patients treated with potentially curative surgery. The small sample size (n=130) precludes definitive conclusions on the role of PET as part of surveillance in colorectal cancer.\n\n【5】 #Liver Metastasis\nPET is recommended in the preoperative assessment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis prior to surgical resection. HTA review : One systematic review with nine primary studies and five additional studies in primary and recurrent populations showed PET to be more accurate than comparators for the detection of liver metastases. Furthermore, in 15 studies of mixed populations, including patients with suspected recurrence, PET sensitivity was about 90% compared with 73% sensitivity for CT. PET specificity was ≥ 85%. The change in management attributed to PET (compared with conventional imaging) varied from 9% to 39% in reported trials. Two studies noted that 6% and 15%, respectively, had the staging incorrectly changed.\nTherefore, PET/CT was suggested as useful tool when findings remain equivocal after a serial imaging review for colorectal cancer.\n\n【6】 #Qualifying Statements\nDespite the change in management reported in these nonrandomized studies, the possibility cannot be ruled out that factors other than PET results were involved in that change ,Facey et al. In the evaluation of patients potentially eligible for the curative resection of colorectal cancer liver metastasis, a diagnostic CT is necessary in addition to PET/CT to provide information on hepatic vasculature and anatomy ,Facey et al. The sensitivity of PET for detecting metastases decreases following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis ,Lubezky et al. PET is less sensitive than CT for detecting metastases following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If PET is to be used for staging purposes, it should be performed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy Cancer Care Ontario reserves the right at any time, and at its sole discretion, to change or revoke this authorization.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:24:42"}

CDC has classified anthrax as a category A biological warfare agent , meaning it has great potential to adversely affect public health. The lethality of aerosolized B. anthracis spores was demonstrated in 1979 when an unintentional release of B. anthracis spores from a military microbiology facility in the former Soviet Union resulted in 64 deaths . The cases of anthrax that occurred after B. anthracis spores were distributed through the U.S. mail in 2001 further underscored the potential dangers of this organism as a bioterrorism threat . Vaccines against anthrax were first developed as early as 1880 and used in livestock #Introduction\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis . Depending on the route of exposure, anthrax can occur in three forms: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or inhalation.\n\n【1】 #Background\nB. anthracis is a facultatively anaerobic, gram-positive, encapsulated, spore-forming, nonmotile rod. The infectious form of B. anthracis that is predominantly found in the environment is the spore, which is approximately 1 µm × 2 µm; anthrax is contracted from these spores, which are highly resistant to heat, cold, drought, UV light, and gamma radiation. B. anthracis has three major virulence factors: an antiphagocytic capsule and two exotoxins, referred to as lethal toxin and edema toxin. These toxins are responsible for the primary clinical manifestations of hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, and death.\nDisease is categorized according to the route of human exposure to B. anthracis spores: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or inhalation. The precise infectious dose of B. anthracis in humans by the various routes is not known; inhalation anthrax can develop in susceptible hosts after exposure to a relatively small number of spores .\n\n【2】 #naturally occurring Anthrax\nThroughout much of the 20th century, anthrax in humans was grouped into two categories: agricultural or industrial . Agricultural cases of anthrax occur among persons who have direct contact with infected sick or dying animals or who handle infected carcasses or tissues. Persons at risk for acquiring anthrax through agricultural exposure might include ranchers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse or abattoir workers, and butchers.\nIndustrial cases of anthrax result from the cutaneous inoculation or inhalation of particles containing B. anthracis spores generated during the cleaning and industrial processing of contaminated hides, hair, or wool from infected animals. Workers in wool and mohair processing facilities were historically at risk for contracting both inhalation and cutaneous anthrax, which made the disease a substantial health hazard in the wool industry in the 19th century and throughout the first half of the 20th century  cases were inhalation anthrax.\nNaturally occurring anthrax cases also have occurred outside of agricultural and industrial settings as a result of contact with products from anthrax-infected animals. Such products include anthrax-contaminated bristle shaving brushes, animal skins, animal hair or yarn, and bone meal ,31. During 2006-2008, three inhalation cases (in the United Kingdom, United States, and Scotland) and two cutaneous cases (in the United States) were associated with drums made from imported contaminated hides ,36,39.\nEstimating the worldwide incidence of naturally occurring human anthrax is difficult because reporting of anthrax cases is unreliable in many settings . However, anthrax is most commonly observed in agricultural regions with inadequate control programs for anthrax in livestock. Anthrax outbreaks affecting domestic animals in these regions lead to direct or indirect human infection. Enzootic and endemic regions include South America, Central America, southern and eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East . The largest recent epidemic of human anthrax occurred in Zimbabwe during 1978-1980 and involved 9,445 cases, including 141 (1.5%) deaths . The incidence of anthrax in animals in the United States has decreased since the middle of the 20th century, from 25 states reporting animal outbreaks in 1951 to eight states reporting outbreaks for the 10-year period from 1997 to 2006 .\nCases that occur sporadically in both domestic livestock and free-ranging wildlife might not be recognized.\nAnthrax is a nationally notifiable disease . In the 21st century, naturally occurring cases of anthrax in the United States have occurred sporadically, with two or fewer cases reported each year. Of the 242 naturally occurring human anthrax cases reported to CDC during 1955-2007, 232 (96%) were cutaneous, 10 (4%) were inhalation, and none were gastrointestinal (CDC, unpublished data, 2010). The only reported case of gastrointestinal anthrax in the United States occurred in 1941  and resulted from an industrial exposure, not from contaminated food. Although gastrointestinal exposure to anthrax has been documented in the United States, no confirmed cases of anthrax resulted from the exposures . In 2010, CDC received a report of a woman with severe gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to B. anthracis spores (CDC, unpublished data, 2010).\n\n【3】 #Bioterrorism-Related Anthrax\nIn 2001, 22 confirmed or suspected human cases of anthrax occurred in the eastern United States (referred to as the bioterrorism events of 2001 in this report) when B. anthracis spores were sent through the mail in powder-containing envelopes to news media companies and U.S. congressional leaders ; however, cross-contaminated mail was considered a possible source.\nB. anthracis has been a focus of offensive and defensive biological warfare research programs worldwide . Anthrax was used against livestock and draft animals as a bioweapon by Germany during World War I; during World War II, Japan conducted weapon field trials with anthrax in Manchuria. Numerous countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the former Soviet Union, and Iraq, conducted anthrax weapons research at various times during World War II, the Cold War, and the decades that followed .\nIn 2008, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement indicating that anthrax poses a threat sufficient to affect U.S. national security . WHO experts have estimated that 50 kg of B. anthracis spores released upwind of a population center of 500,000 persons could result in 95,000 deaths and 125,000 hospitalizations , and a release of 100 kg of spores upwind of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area would result in an estimated 130,000 to 3 million deaths . An intentionally dispersed strain of B. anthracis might have different characteristics from a naturally occurring strain. Intentionally dispersed strains might demonstrate antimicrobial resistance or increased dispersion capabilities. Primary aerosolization (dispersion of particles in air resulting from the initial release) and secondary aerosolization (resulting from agitation of the settled particles from the primary release) are important considerations in bioterrorist acts . The magnitude of risk for inhalation anthrax from secondary aerosolization of B. anthracis spores is uncertain.\nThe bioterrorism events of 2001 prompted extensive biodefense research, as well as the creation and implementation of bioterrorism preparedness plans. Since 2001, in addition to increasing the number of public health mechanisms by which drugs and vaccines are distributed and dispensed or administered (i.e. EUA), emergency response and preparedness measures have focused on improving the effectiveness and timeliness of distributing and dispensing antimicrobials and vaccine for PEP.\nEfforts also have been made to improve the availability and timely distribution and administration of AVA in postevent settings. Because AVA is not licensed for postexposure use, the vaccine may be made available under an IND protocol or possibly under an EUA in an emergency .\n\n【4】 #Pathogenesis and Disease\nB. anthracis enters the host in the form of spores  at the epidermis (cutaneous anthrax), the gastrointestinal epithelium (gastrointestinal anthrax), or the lung mucosa (inhalation anthrax). It is unknown whether B. anthracis has an active invasive process, and the symptoms and incubation period vary depending on the route of exposure to the spores. In general, symptoms of any form of anthrax usually begin within 7 days of exposure . Most naturally occurring B. anthracis bacteria are sensitive to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. Before initiating antimicrobial treatment, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the organism by culture. In practice, B. anthracis is readily identifiable using a range of standard microbiological tests, including Gram stain, cell and colony morphology, sensitivity of the gamma phage of McCloy, and production of the γ-linked poly-d-glutamic acid (γDGA) capsule in blood or under culture in 20% carbon dioxide.\nMost cutaneous and gastrointestinal infections occur at the site of preexisting lesions . Inhalation anthrax occurs after inhalation of aerosolized particles containing viable B. anthracis spores and their deposition at the alveolar epithelial surface . Anthrax meningitis can occur secondary to any of the three forms of anthrax. Although meningitis can occur without any other clinical signs and symptoms of anthrax, the condition is most often associated with inhalation anthrax.\nThe pathogenicity and proliferation of B. anthracis in the host are primarily a result of the combined actions of the γDGA capsule and the two protein exotoxins, edema toxin (a complex composed of protective antigen  and edema factor) and lethal toxin (a complex of PA and lethal factor) . Production of the capsule and toxins parallels the germination and outgrowth of B. anthracis spores . The capsule is considered to be antiphagocytotic, and the exotoxins disarm the innate and acquired immune responses . Edema toxin increases host intracellular cyclic adenosine monophospate (cAMP) levels, resulting in cytokine modulation, upregulation of the anthrax toxin receptor, and disruption of interstitial fluid balance .\n\n【5】 #Cutaneous Anthrax\nMore than 95% of all naturally occurring B. anthracis infections worldwide are cutaneous. This form of anthrax is associated with handling infected animals or contaminated items such as meat, wool, hides, leather, or hair products from infected animals . Cutaneous anthrax has characteristic signs and symptoms and is recognizable if the physician is familiar with the disease. The majority of cutaneous anthrax lesions develop in exposed areas such as the face, neck, arms, and hands. The lesion begins as a small, often pruritic papule that quickly enlarges and develops a central vesicle or bulla, which ruptures or erodes, leaving an underlying necrotic ulcer. A characteristic firmly adherent, black eschar develops over the surface of the ulcer. The lesion is usually painless. Satellite vesicles and ulcers might also form . Edematous swelling of the surrounding tissues occurs, often with regional lymphadenopathy and lymphangitis. Systemic signs and symptoms, including fever, malaise, and headache, might accompany the cutaneous lesion . Historically, case-fatality rates for cutaneous anthrax have been as high as 20% without appropriate treatment but <1% with appropriate antimicrobial therapy . Because the progression of the disease is mediated by toxins, the lesions progress through the various stages once they have appeared, even with antimicrobial therapy. Discharge from cutaneous lesions might be infectious; however, the risk for personto-person transmission of cutaneous anthrax is very low .\nDifferential diagnoses for a blackened eschar or other lesion include staphylococcal or streptococcal cellulitis or lymphadenitis, eczema, and herpes simplex or varicella zoster. In addition, depending on the epidemiologic history or route of exposure, parapoxvirus infection (orf virus and pseudocowpox virus) should be considered, because they are the most common parapoxviruses in U.S. food animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The differential diagnoses also include brown recluse spider bite, rickettsial pox, ecthyma gangrenosum, ulceroglandular tularemia, plague, typhus, glanders, erysipelas, cat-scratch disease, rat-bite fever, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, vaccinia, cutaneous leishmaniasis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and leprosy .\nThe incubation period for cutaneous disease is reported to be 5-7 days (range: 1-12 days) . However, during the 1979 Sverdlovsk outbreak, cutaneous cases reportedly developed up to 13 days after the aerosol release of spores , and an outbreak in Algeria was reported with a median incubation period of 19 days .\n\n【6】 #Gastrointestinal Anthrax\nGastrointestinal anthrax typically occurs after eating raw or undercooked contaminated meat, although spores consumed through any route, including spores that are inhaled and subsequently swallowed, can result in gastrointestinal anthrax. In the United States, no cases of gastrointestinal anthrax have been reported since 1941 . Although gastrointestinal anthrax could occur as a result of bioterrorist activity, no bioterrorismassociated cases have been reported. Gastrointestinal anthrax can occur in two forms: 1 intestinal or abdominal or 2 oropharyngeal. Data from human cases and outbreaks are limited, although clinical disease likely ranges from asymptomatic to fatal . The primary site of infection is the gastrointestinal epithelium. Infection might be associated with preexisting lesions in the alimentary tract, which might play a role in the development of oropharyngeal lesions. However, studies in mice demonstrated infection in the Peyer patches of the small intestine after intragastric deposition of spores .\nThe intestinal form develops when spores infect the gastrointestinal tract epithelium after consumption of undercooked, contaminated meat. Signs and symptoms range from subclinical gastrointestinal disturbances to clinical illness with nausea and vomiting, fever, anorexia, and abdominal pain and tenderness and can progress to hematemesis and bloody diarrhea. Abdominal distension with voluminous, hemorrhagic ascites might be present .\nThe oropharyngeal form occurs after infection of the oropharyngeal epithelium and is characterized by lesions at the base of the tongue or tonsils, with sore throat, dysphagia, fever, and regional lymphadenopathy. Edematous lesions develop, which progress to necrotic ulcers covered with a pseudomembrane. Edema and swelling develop in the oropharynx and neck, accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fever .\n\n【7】 #Inhalation Anthrax\nInhalation anthrax is a systemic infection caused by inhalation of B. anthracis spores. The mediastinal lymph nodes are most often the nidus of bacterial proliferation. Inhalation anthrax has historically accounted for 5% of all anthrax cases in the United States . This form of the disease results from the inhalation of aerosolized B. anthracis spore-containing particles that are ≤5 microns . Spore-containing aerosols can be generated through industrial processing or work with spore-contaminated animal products such as wool, hair, or hides; by laboratory procedures such as vortexing of cultures; or as a result of the intentional release of aerosolized spores. Inhaled spores lodge in the alveolar recesses and can become dormant, remaining dormant for weeks to months They are subsequently taken up by alveolar macrophages and then germinate , leading to substantial variability in the incubation period.\nEarly studies of inhalation anthrax demonstrated that inhaled spores are phagocytosed by macrophages in the lungs and transported to the pulmonary-associated lymph nodes, where germination and vegetative growth occur, followed by bacteremia and dissemination to the rest of the body . Once taken up by alveolar macrophages, some spores are transported to the pulmonary-associated lymph nodes, where they continue to germinate, multiply, and release toxins ,69, resulting in hemorrhagic necrosis of the thoracic lymph nodes that drain the lungs, or a hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Animal models also have demonstrated rapid phagocytosis of B. anthracis spores by interstitial dendritic cells, followed by dendritic cell migration to the thoracic lymph nodes . Exposure to aerosolized spores also has resulted in infection of nasal-associated lymphoid tissues in <24 hours, followed by subsequent spread to mandibular lymph nodes . Necrotizing pneumonitis occasionally develops .\nInitial signs and symptoms of inhalation anthrax are nonspecific and might include sore throat, mild fever, and muscle aches; these symptoms might initially be mistaken for an upper respiratory infection .\nAntimicrobial agents are effective against germinating and vegetative B. anthracis, but dormant spores are refractory to antimicrobials. Studies in nonhuman primates receiving antimicrobials suggest that inhaled B. anthracis spores can persist for up to 100 days in a dormant state at the alveolar surface epithelium . Inhalation anthrax has developed up to 58 days after experimental aerosol exposure in primates that received postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis for the first 30 days after aerosol exposure . Reported incubation periods for inhalation anthrax in humans range from 1 to 43 days .\nDisease development can be prevented as long as the administered antimicrobial agent is maintained at levels sufficient to kill germinating B. anthracis organisms while dormant spores are cleared from the host. Cessation of antimicrobial treatment before clearance of the spores might allow residual spores to germinate and cause infection; therefore, the onset of inhalation anthrax might appear to be delayed . This late germination has not been observed in persons who have had a cutaneous or gastrointestinal exposure.\nStudies in animals suggest that incubation periods might decrease when the inoculum quantity increases .\nCase-fatality ratios of 86% and 89% were reported after the 1979 Sverdlosk outbreak in the former Soviet Union and in the United States during in the 20th century, respectively .\n\n【8】 #Bacteremic Dissemination and Meningitis\n\n【9】 Anthrax meningitis has been reported with all three clinical forms of anthrax and likely results from hematogenous spread across the blood-brain barrier, generally presenting as hemorrhagic meningitis. Anthrax meningitis is characterized by a fulminant, rapidly progressive clinical course; even with aggressive therapy, cases are usually fatal .\n\n【10】 #Control and Prevention\nHuman anthrax is best controlled through prevention, including preexposure vaccination for persons at high risk for encountering aerosolized B. anthracis spores, reduction of animal illness by vaccination of livestock at risk for anthrax, and environmental controls to decrease exposure to contaminated animal products, such as imported hair and skins. After a person is exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, a combination of antimicrobials and vaccine provides the best available protection.\n\n【11】 #Reduction of Risk for Exposure\nThe incidence of naturally occurring human anthrax in the United States is greatly reduced through vaccinating and preventing infection in livestock, improving industrial hygiene, and decreasing the use of contaminated raw imported materials. Effective animal disease control programs have reduced the incidence of animal anthrax, and therefore human anthrax, worldwide. Since the initiation of annual vaccination of livestock in endemic regions in 1957, naturally occurring human cases in the United States have decreased from 38 cases in 1956 to fewer than two cases annually during 1980-2008. Anthrax in livestock can be controlled through vaccination programs, rapid detection and reporting of cases, and proper disposal of dead animals with suspected or confirmed anthrax, preferably by incineration  and should be followed.\n\n【12】 #Vaccination Vaccine Development\nThe first effective anthrax vaccines using live, attenuated cultures of B. anthracis were demonstrated in 1880 by William S. Greenfield and in 1881 by Louis Pasteur .\nThe formulation for which MDPH sought premarket approval became AVA; the vaccine was licensed by NIH in 1970 and reapproved for licensure by FDA in 1985 . The safety and immunogenicity of the three generations of anthrax vaccine have been evaluated, and the resulting data support the FDA licensure of AVA . AVA is now marketed as BioThrax (Emergent BioSolutions, Lansing, Michigan) and is licensed for use in persons aged 18-65 years who are at high risk for exposure. AVA is not licensed for use in children (i.e. persons aged <18 years) or pregnant women .\n\n【13】 #AVA\nAVA is the only licensed human anthrax vaccine in the United States. AVA was originally licensed for SC administration as a series of 6 priming doses .\n\n【14】 #Route of Administration and Immunogenicity\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity of AVA in humans and animals. However, a serologic correlate of protection has not been fully defined. Several studies have demonstrated seroconversion (fourfold rise in anti-PA immunoglobulin G  titers) rates of 85%-100% among adults receiving 2 and 3 doses of SC or IM AVA , indicating a strong, long-lasting immune response to the vaccine. Additional data have demonstrated statistically significant increases in anti-PA IgG levels among those with a prolonged interval between the first and second doses of AVA when compared with persons receiving AVA as originally licensed .\nIn December 2008, FDA approved a BLA supplement submitted by Emergent BioSolutions for use of AVA in a pre-event or preexposure setting. The current licensed schedule consists of 5 0.5-ml IM injections (at 0 and 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months) and 0.5-ml booster injections at 1-year intervals after the 18-month dose. Although ACIP now recommends 5 doses of AVA administered IM for pre-event or preexposure prophylaxis, persons with medical contraindications to IM administration (e.g. persons with coagulation disorders) may continue to receive the vaccine by SC administration . However, when administering AVA as a component of PEP, the vaccine should only be administered with 3 doses by the SC route under an IND or EUA.\nA randomized study of 173 participants compared the first 3 AVA doses of the originally licensed schedule (SC injections at 0, 2, and 4 weeks) with alternate regimens (SC or IM injections at 0 and 4 weeks and SC or IM injections at 0 and 2 weeks). The antibody concentrations for the group that followed the originally licensed schedule were comparable to those from the groups receiving injections at 0-4 weeks. In addition, the groups that received AVA 4 weeks apart had peak anti-PA IgG concentrations that were approximately threefold higher than those for the groups that received AVA 2 weeks apart . This study suggested that increasing the interval between the first AVA doses might lead to an immune response comparable to that of the originally licensed schedule, with fewer doses required to achieve that response. However, the results of the study could not be used to support a change in the use of the vaccine because of the small sample size. In 2000, the U.S. Congress funded the CDC-sponsored AVRP clinical trial, a large, phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the immune response to a reduced-dose schedule and a change in the route of administration from SC to IM . The AVRP clinical trial enrolled 1,564 civilian participants in five U.S. sites during May 2002-March 2004. Fifty-one percent of the participants were women, and 49% were men; ages ranged from 18-61 years and were evenly distributed among study groups. Approximately 75% of participants were white, 15% were black, and 10% were categorized as other. Participants were randomly assigned one of the following six vaccination schedules, with vaccinations administered over 42 months: 1 the originally licensed schedule of 8 SC doses (4 doses for the reported interim analysis); 2 8 IM doses (4 IM doses for the reported interim analysis); 3-5 7, 5, or 4 IM doses (3 IM doses through month 6, with the three groups combined into one group for purposes of the interim analysis); and 6 placebo . As of February 2009, when ACIP voted on the revised recommendations, data were available for review through dose 4.\nIn 2005, CDC submitted data to FDA from the interim analysis of the first 1,005 enrolled participants who, at the time of the analysis, had received 4 doses of AVA by the SC route or the IM route or 3 doses by the IM route. Emergent BioSolutions subsequently filed a supplemental BLA. The primary outcome measures of this analysis were noninferiority of the anti-PA IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC), the geometric mean titer (GMT), and the proportion of responders with a fourfold increase in titer at week 8 (4 weeks after the week 4 dose) and month 7 (4 weeks after the month 6 dose) . At week 8, antibody responses were significantly higher in women than men in the 4-IM and 3-IM groups but not in the 4-SC group. By month 7, no significant differences between men and women had been detected in any of the groups analyzed. Antibody levels also were significantly higher in whites compared with blacks at week 8 (p<0.05), but by month 7, they were equivalent. Serological noninferiority analyses of antibody responses (anti-PA IgG GMC) demonstrated the noninferiority of both the 3-IM regimen and the 4-IM regimen to the originally licensed schedule at month 7 .\nCDC is analyzing animal data and designing bridging studies to correlate nonhuman primate immune responses to AVA with survival from inhalation anthrax\n\n【15】 #Efficacy\nEvidence for the efficacy of AVA comes from several studies in animals (including in nonhuman primates) and from a controlled vaccine trial in humans , observational data in humans ; no data are available regarding the efficacy of anthrax vaccine for persons aged 65 years.\nThe protective efficacy of the alum-precipitated vaccine (the original form of the PA filtrate vaccine) and AVA (adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide) has been demonstrated in several animal models using different routes of administration 132,144. The Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is considered a suitable model of inhalation anthrax in humans .\nInitial evidence for efficacy in humans came from the Brachman study, a placebo-controlled, single-blind, clinical trial among workers in four northeastern U.S. mills that processed raw, imported goat hair . The study was conducted during 1955-1959 using the alum-precipitated vaccine, the precursor to the currently licensed AVA. A total of 1,249 workers were included: 379 received the full series of anthrax vaccine, 414 received placebo, 116 received an incomplete series of injections (with either vaccine or placebo), and 340 received no treatment (observational group). Before vaccination, the yearly average number of human cutaneous and inhalation anthrax cases among employees in these mills was 1.2 cases per 100 employees. During the study, 26 anthrax cases (five inhalation and 21 cutaneous) were reported from the four mills. All five inhalation cases (four of which were fatal) occurred in participants who had not received vaccine; two had received placebo, and three had been in the observational group. Twenty of the 21 cutaneous cases occurred among participants who had not been fully vaccinated. Fifteen of the 21 had received placebo injections, three had received no injections (observational group), and three had received some doses of anthrax vaccine. Among the three cases that occurred in vaccinated persons, one occurred just before administration of the scheduled third dose, one occurred 13 months after completion of the scheduled 6 doses (but before any booster doses were received), and one occurred just before receipt of the first booster dose. The efficacy analysis in this study included all cases of anthrax, regardless of the route of exposure or manifestation of the disease, providing a combined efficacy of 92.5% based on person-time of occupational exposure .\nDuring 1962-1974, CDC collected surveillance data, independently of the Brachman clinical study, on cases of anthrax in mill workers or persons living near mills in the United States .\nIn March 2002, a committee appointed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a comprehensive review of the most current safety and efficacy data available for AVA . The committee found human efficacy data to be limited to the Brachman study  and the CDC surveillance data .\nThe duration of AVA protection in humans after the initial priming series is unknown. Persons are considered protected from anthrax for as long as they continue receiving AVA according to the licensed schedule. A 2002 study of military personnel who had received 1, 2, or 3 priming doses during the early 1990s, followed by 1 dose 18-24 months later, demonstrated that 99.3% of participants had measurable anamnestic responses . Data from animal studies suggest that the duration of protection after 2 doses might be 1-2 years and that 3 IM doses of AVA provide significant levels of protection in rhesus macaques for up to 4 years .\n\n【16】 #Safety\nAt least eight reviews ,9,135,136,145,152, and 35 other publications include evaluations of AVA safety.\n\n【17】 #Prelicensure Adverse Event Surveillance\nLocal Reactions. In prelicensure evaluations, 6,985 persons received 16,435 SC doses: 9,893 initial series doses and 6,542 annual boosters . Severe local reactions (defined as edema or induration of >120 mm) occurred after 1% of vaccinations. Moderate local reactions (defined as edema and induration of 30-120 mm) occurred after 3% of vaccinations. Mild local reactions (defined as erythema, edema, and induration of <30 mm) occurred after 20% of vaccinations. In a study of the alum-precipitated precursor to AVA, moderate local reactions were documented in 4% of vaccine recipients and mild reactions in 30% of recipients .\nSystemic Reactions. In prelicensure evaluations, systemic reactions (i.e. fever, chills, body aches, or nausea) occurred in <0.06% (in four of approximately 7,000) of vaccine recipients . In the study of the alum-precipitated precursor to AVA, systemic reactions occurred in 0.2% of vaccine recipients .\n\n【18】 #Postlicensure Adverse Event Surveillance\nDuring January 1, 1998-December 31, 2008, nearly 12.4 million doses of AVA were distributed for DoD and domestic licensed use (AT Waytes, Emergent BioSolutions, personal communication, November 5, 2009); 8.4 million of these doses were administered to approximately 2.1 million military personnel during March 1, 1998-December 31, 2008 (P Garman, Military Vaccine Agency, personal communication, November 5, 2009). Less than 1% of all AVA doses were distributed to nonmilitary sources (AT Waytes, Emergent BioSolutions, personal communication, November 5, 2009). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has been used extensively to monitor adverse events that occur after vaccination with AVA. VAERS , a U.S. national passive surveillance system for reporting adverse events that occur after administration of U.S. licensed vaccines, plays an important role in the identification of adverse events that warrant further investigation. Although VAERS data are useful for detecting rare adverse events and assessing reporting trends, they cannot be used to assess incidence rates or causality. Reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including health-care providers, patients, manufacturers, or family members; therefore, reports might vary in quality and completeness, often lack detail, and might include inaccurate information. Because VAERS is a passive surveillance system, actual rates for adverse events cannot be calculated because the number of doses administered is unknown. Underreporting is another important limitation, as is differential reporting (e.g. increased reporting rates for specific vaccines or specific adverse events), which often occurs for more serious and unexpected events, events occurring soon after vaccination, events surrounded by publicity, and reports related to litigation proceedings .\nDuring January 1, 1998-December 31, 2008, VAERS received 6,015 nonduplicate reports from U.S. sources of adverse events after receipt of AVA, either alone or concurrently with other vaccines (CDC, unpublished data, 2010). Of these, 600 (9.9%) were categorized as serious events (i.e. events resulting in death, hospitalization, or permanent disability) . Approximately 74% of all reported adverse events that occurred after administration of AVA were in persons aged <40 years. Twenty-six percent occurred in women and 72% in men; sex was not specified in 2% of the reports. The majority (75%) received AVA alone, and 25% received the vaccine concurrently with other vaccines. Eighty three percent of AVA reports were documented as being administered or funded by the military (CDC, unpublished data, 2010).\nAdverse events reported to VAERS are coded using terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) .\nApproximately 800 different MedDRA terms were reported in conjunction with AVA during 1998-2008. The 10 most common adverse events that occurred after AVA administration (either alone or concurrently with other vaccines) were arthralgia (n = 1,036, 17.2%), headache (n = 981, 16.3%), pruritis (n = 878, 14.6%), pain .\nReports to VAERS after AVA administration have been reviewed by several expert groups .\nShort-Term Adverse Events. Data on the safety of AVA are only available for persons aged 18-65 years; no information is available on the safety of this vaccine in children or older adults (>65 years). Much of the published data comes from the routine DoD anthrax vaccination program. Several studies, including clinical trials and uncontrolled observational studies, have examined immediate or short-term adverse events (e.g. hours to days) that occurred after receipt of AVA . The majority of these events have been limited to local reactions (e.g. erythema, swelling, pain or tenderness, itching, and nodules) or mild, self-limited systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise). After a comprehensive review, the IOM committee  found no evidence that AVA recipients had a higher risk than the general population for life-threatening or permanently disabling adverse events immediately after receiving AVA and that rates and types of immediate or short-term reactions were comparable to those for other vaccines regularly administered to adults .\nAfter the bioterrorism events of 2001, 1,727 persons participated in the CDC Anthrax Vaccine and Antimicrobial Availability program and received either AVA and antimicrobials or only antimicrobials . Among the enrollees, 199 participants opted to receive AVA and antimicrobials. Local and systemic adverse event profiles for AVA recipients compared with those for persons who received only antimicrobials indicated that a higher proportion of persons who received AVA reported adverse events than did persons who received only antimicrobials. The most commonly reported adverse events among vaccine recipients were discomfort at the injection site (70.9%), erythema (45.2%), induration (58.8%), and swelling (39.7%). Participants who received AVA by the SC route in the AVRP clinical trial reported warmth, tenderness, erythema, induration, and nodule development more frequently than participants who received AVA by the IM route. Although fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported systemic adverse events among clinical trial participants, they were reported by <11% of participants. Women reported significantly more injection-site and systemic adverse events than men .\nSeveral reviews have noted that women report a higher proportion of certain adverse events after AVA than men . A comprehensive review of VAERS AVA data in 2004 demonstrated that women were 3 times more likely than men to have or report an adverse event.\nWomen were not more likely to be hospitalized than men because of adverse events, although women accounted for a greater proportion of reported injection-site adverse events and moderate or extensive injection-site inflammation . A study of female AVRP clinical trial participants to assess the effect of progesterone levels on adverse events and immune response is ongoing; final data will be available in late 2010.\nLong-Term (Chronic) Adverse Events. DoD has published several studies of long-term health effects among vaccinated and unvaccinated military personnel . Additional studies have assessed the long-term health of vaccinated researchers and fertility parameters for vaccinated males  that no convincing evidence exists to indicate that the risk for developing long-term adverse health effects is higher among anthrax vaccine recipients. As with all vaccines, the possibility for rare adverse reactions does exist with AVA.\nThe Vaccine Analytic Unit (VAU) , which was developed to implement the IOM recommendations , is a collaborative CDC and DoD project with FDA participation. Using data from DMSS, VAU can analyze vaccine safety data for all vaccines administered to active-duty and reserve service personnel. In a matched case-control study, VAU investigators found no significant associations between optic neuritis and previous receipt of AVA, smallpox, hepatitis B, or influenza vaccines . In addition, VAU found no association between concurrent receipt of multiple vaccinations and hospitalization risk among U.S. military personnel . Studies to address additional topics (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and diffuse connective tissue diseases) are ongoing.\n\n【19】 #Effect of Route of Administration on Adverse Events\nA small randomized study on the effects of route of administration on adverse events found that systemic adverse events were uncommon and similar for IM and SC groups. All local reactions (i.e. tenderness, erythema, warmth, induration, and subcutaneous nodules) were significantly more common after SC injection than after IM injection. Women who received IM injections 4 weeks apart reported fewer of certain local adverse events than did women who received SC injections 2 weeks apart .\nThe AVRP clinical trial demonstrated that the proportion of injection-site adverse events was lower in the group receiving 4 IM injections than in the group receiving 4 SC injections, especially among women, who experienced a significant decrease in the occurrence of warmth, tenderness, itching, erythema, induration, edema, and nodules. In addition, the duration of injection-site adverse events in the 4-IM group was shorter than that experienced by the 4-SC group. Persons in the 4-IM group also experienced significantly fewer moderate and severe injection-site adverse events (7.0%) than persons in the 4-SC group (10.2%, p = 0.04). Analog pain scale scores used to assess pain immediately after injection were significantly lower in the 4-IM group compared with the 4-SC group (p<0.01). In all study groups, women were almost twice as likely as men to experience an injection-site adverse event ( = 1.93, p<0.01); however, the absolute differences between women and men for warmth, itching, erythema, induration, and nodules were largest in the 4-SC group. Route of administration was not associated with the occurrence of systemic adverse events, and the differences between men and women in regards to systemic adverse events were generally consistent across all study groups (including the placebo group) .\n\n【20】 #Effect of Vaccination on Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\nA paucity of data exists regarding the use of AVA during pregnancy; however, in general, the use of inactivated vaccines is considered safe during pregnancy . Some evidence indicates that nonspecific stimulation of the maternal immune system might decrease the risk for birth defects .\nAnother study of 385 women who had received at least 1 dose of AVA before becoming pregnant  found no evidence of miscarriage, infertility, or other reproductive problems among vaccinated women. In addition, the study did not support the hypothesis that AVA administration resulted in decreased pregnancy rates among those vaccinated before pregnancy.\nNo data have been collected on the use of AVA among breastfeeding women. Therefore, whether anti-anthrax antibodies are transferred through milk from mother to infant is unknown; however, data from similar vaccines indicate that this might occur . No biological reason suggests that breastfeeding women or breastfed children have an increased risk for adverse events after the mother receives anthrax vaccine. Administration of other inactivated vaccines during breastfeeding is not medically contraindicated .\n\n【21】 #Vaccination of Children\nAVA use in children has not been studied, and the vaccine is not licensed for use in this population. A 2004 review demonstrated that children aged <18 months experienced more local erythema and induration after receipt of vaccines containing an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant than after receipt of nonadjuvanted vaccines. Erythema and induration were not reported in children aged 10-18 years, although these older children experienced local pain lasting up to 14 days after administration of vaccines with aluminum hydroxide adjuvants . The concentration of aluminum per dose of AVA is similar to that in the diptheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and is less than that in the combined DTaP/polio/hepatitis B vaccine . Because AVA contains aluminum hydroxide, local adverse events are likely to be similar to those described in adults administered AVA and in children administered other vaccines with similar aluminum hydroxide concentrations; ACIP concluded that no evidence suggests that the risk for serious adverse events after receipt of anthrax vaccine is higher in children. The morbidity of inhalation anthrax should be considered when children have been exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores.\n\n【22】 #PEP for Previously Unvaccinated Persons Vaccination as a Component of PEP\nStudies have demonstrated not only the persistence of spores in nonhuman primates up to 100 days after inhalation exposure  but also the potential for long-term spore survival and development of inhalation anthrax after discontinuation of postexposure antimicrobial agents .\nAs described, the AVRP clinical trial  demonstrated that a vaccination schedule of doses administered at 0 and 4 weeks via the IM route elicited a lower antibody response at week 8 than did a schedule of doses administered at weeks 0, 2, and 4 via the SC or IM route . Because the clinical signifi-cance of the lower immune response to a schedule of doses administered at 0 and 4 weeks is not known, and sex-related differences in antibody levels exist, adherence to a schedule that produces rapid development of high antibody levels is particularly beneficial in a postexposure setting. Therefore, in June 2009, FDA recommended retaining the current PEP protocol (3-dose SC series administered at 0, 2, and 4 weeks in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy for a minimum of 60 days) until additional data are available (J Clifford, FDA, personal communication, June 24, 2009). After natural, occupational, or bioterrorism-related exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, the combination of AVA and antimicrobials is more effective than use of antimicrobials only. Vaccination as a component of PEP is beneficial when antimicrobial PEP is discontinued too soon after exposure. Poor adherence to the prescribed regimen, which has been as low as 42%, minimizes the effectiveness of postexposure antimicrobial therapy . The bioterrorism events of 2001 also suggested that persons might be exposed to larger amounts of B. anthracis spores than those studied in animal models. A possible consequence would be prolonged spore clearance, with increased levels of residual spores at the alveolar surface epithelium and therefore an increased potential for infection when antimicrobial prophylaxis is discontinued after 60 days .\nBecause of the potential for short incubation periods with inhalation anthrax, especially when the inhaled dose might be large, and the rapid progression and associated high morbidity and mortality, antimicrobial PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after inhalation exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores. Vaccination also should be initiated as quickly as possible but will likely occur several days after antimicrobial agent initiation for logistical reasons. To maximize the benefits of vaccine, the first dose should be initiated within 10 days of exposure. Antimicrobial use should continue until the immune response to the priming series has developed, which is expected to be 10-14 days after administration of the third dose of vaccine. PEP recommendations for inhalation exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores differ from those for a naturally occurring cutaneous or gastrointestinal exposure.\n\n【23】 #Antimicrobial Agents as a Component of PEP\nBecause limited data are available, the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy in combination PEP is uncertain. Antimicrobial therapy for 60 days, without vaccine, might prevent inhalation anthrax; however, antimicrobial agents without vaccine might not protect persons from late spore germination. Using the limited available data, FDA licensed a 60-day course of antimicrobials for postexposure use; a shorter course (<60 days) of antimicrobial therapy, even when combined with a 3-dose AVA series, is not approved for use by FDA. In 2006, an expert panel  discussed whether, based on the limited evidence , the duration of antimicrobial use could be shortened with concurrent receipt of AVA. The panel determined that the available data were too limited to support a regimen of <60 days.\nOral ciprofloxacin, oral doxycycline, and parenteral (IM) penicillin G procaine have been shown to be effective for PEP use in a nonhuman primate model  and are FDA approved for a 60-day course for inhalation anthrax (postexposure) in all age groups .\nSelection of PEP agents should involve consideration of the potential for antimicrobial resistance. Both naturally occurring constitutive and inducible β-lactamase production can be present in B. anthracis isolates ,207. Because induction of resistance has been previously reported in the nonhuman primate model , there are concerns that an insufficient dosage could induce penicillin resistance in humans .\nAlthough oral amoxicillin is an alternative to the first-line PEP agents when antimicrobial susceptibility profiles demonstrate appropriate sensitivity (minimum inhibitory concentration  ≤0.125 µg/mL), amoxicillin has not been studied for the prophylaxis or treatment of anthrax, and no safety or efficacy data are available for this indication. Amoxicillin is not FDA approved for use as a component of PEP and therefore should only be administered under an IND or possibly under an EUA to certain patient groups (e.g. children or pregnant or nursing women) during a declared emergency provided the criteria for issuance have been met.\nLevofloxacin been shown to be effective for PEP use in a nonhuman primate model  and is FDA approved for inhalation anthrax (postexposure) in patients aged >6 months . Short-term (up to 28 days) safety data exist, but extended-use (up to 60 days) data are limited . Therefore, levofloxacin is recommended as a second-line PEP antimicrobial agent to be reserved for instances in which tolerance issues or drug resistance patterns indicate its use.\nDosing information for recommended antimicrobial agents for PEP is provided . For patients unable to tolerate FDA-approved antimicrobial agents, clinicians may consider clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, vancomycin, or other fluoroquinolones for PEP, based on in vitro susceptibility results. Administration of these agents would be considered off-label use (i.e. for other than the FDA-approved use) and might require an IND or EUA.\n\n【24】 #Adverse Events Associated with Antimicrobial PEP\nAdverse events associated with the long-term use of antimicrobial PEP include gastrointestinal upset and other conditions that are expected when normal body flora are disrupted by antimicrobial use . Any antimicrobial agent can have undesirable side effects, including allergic reactions. Patients should be urged to inform public health authorities and their health-care providers of any adverse events that occur. Longterm fluoroquinolone use has been associated with tendinitis and tendon tears .\nDuring the bioterrorism events of 2001, approximately 10,000 persons were recommended to receive a 60-day regimen of antimicrobial prophylaxis (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or amoxicillin) for suspected or confirmed exposure to B. anthracis spores. Adverse events that were commonly reported by patients were not serious and included diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and fatigue .\n\n【25】 #Antimicrobial Considerations for Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women\nBased on limited human clinical information, use of therapeutic doses of ciprofloxacin during pregnancy is unlikely to have a substantial teratogenic risk; however, the actual teratogenic risk from ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy is unknown .\nPotential risks associated with the use of tetracycline antimicrobials during pregnancy include dental staining of the fetal primary teeth and possible depressed fetal bone growth and dental enamel defects. Hepatic necrosis has been reported in pregnant women using tetracyclines, although such reports are rare . Tetracyclines should be used cautiously in asymptomatic pregnant women and only if contraindications to the use of other appropriate antimicrobial agents exist. Penicillins are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy and are not associated with an increased risk for fetal malformation .\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics considers ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines (including doxycycline) to be appropriate for breastfeeding women because the amount of drug absorbed by infants is small; however, little is known about the safety of long-term use . Because of the severity of inhalation anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are considered the firstline antimicrobial agents of choice for PEP  as indicated for adults in these recommendations. Because amoxicillin is known to be safe for infants, this antimicrobial is an option for PEP for breastfeeding mothers when the appropriate conditions described have been met and when the mother has no contraindications to amoxicillin. If an infant is exposed to B. anthracis and is receiving PEP, the antimicrobial regimen of the breastfeeding mother should be the same as that of the child, when possible, to minimize infant exposure to multiple drugs.\nIf the drug used by the mother is contraindicated in her infant, the mother should express and discard her breast milk while being treated. Breastfeeding may resume after the mother completes the course of antimicrobial therapy .\n\n【26】 #Antimicrobial Considerations for Children\nAlthough antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are typically not administered to children, the severity of anthrax is sufficient that treatment with these antimicrobials is warranted and recommended for children who have been exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores. Amoxicillin is preferred for antimicrobial PEP in children when susceptibility testing indicates that the B. anthracis isolate involved is susceptible to penicillins (i.e. MIC ≤0.125 µg/mL for amoxicillin). In these instances, a transition from ciprofloxacin or doxycycline to amoxicillin is recommended for completion of the 60-day PEP antimicrobial regimen . - Antimicrobials should continue for 14 days after administration of the third dose of vaccine.  AVA used for PEP must be administered subcutaneously.  Levofloxacin is a second-line antimicrobial agent for PEP for persons aged ≥6 mos with medical issues (e.g. tolerance or resistance to ciprofloxacin) that indicate its use. Children: 16 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hrs; each dose should not exceed 250 mg. Adults: 500 mg every 24 hrs. Safety data on extended use of levofloxacin in any population for >28 days are limited; therefore, levofloxacin PEP should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.  The antimicrobial of choice for initial prophylactic therapy among pregnant women is ciprofloxacin. Doxycycline should be used with caution in asymptomatic pregnant women and only when other appropriate antimicrobial drugs are contraindicated. Although tetracyclines are not recommended during pregnancy, their use might be indicated for life-threatening illness.  If susceptibility testing demonstrates an amoxicillin MIC ≤0.125 µg/mL, oral amoxicillin should be used to complete therapy. Use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones in children can have adverse effects. These effects must be weighed carefully against the risk for developing life-threatening disease. If exposure to B. anthracis is confirmed, children may be treated initially with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as prophylaxis. However, amoxicillin is preferred for antimicrobial PEP in children when susceptibility testing indicates that the B. anthracis isolate is susceptible to penicillins. Each ciprofloxacin dose should not exceed 500 mg, or 1 g/day. In 1991, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) amended the recommendation to allow treatment of young children with tetracyclines for serious infections such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever for which doxycycline might be indicated. Doxycycline is preferred for its twice daily dosage and low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. * Because of the lack of data on amoxicillin dosages for treating anthrax (and the associated high mortality rate), AAP recommends a higher dosage of 80 mg/kg/day, divided into 3 daily doses; each dose should not exceed 500 mg. If this higher dosage of amoxicillin is used, recipients should be carefully monitored for side effects from long-term treatment.\n\n【27】 #Antimicrobial Considerations for other Populations\nFor other specific populations, such as older adults or patients with certain underlying medical conditions (i.e. diabetes or renal failure), standard medical practice should be followed. Additional antimicrobial agents that are not FDA approved for treatment or prevention of anthrax but that may be considered include clindamycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, vancomycin, and other fluoroquinolones. Health-care providers should consult with public health officials when choosing alternative antimicrobial agents and should consider the antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated strains of B. anthracis.\n\n【28】 #Risk for Exposure to B. anthracis\nAnthrax exposure is categorized as non-bioterrorism related (i.e. naturally occurring) or bioterrorism related (i.e. intentional). Although naturally occurring anthrax decreased substantially in the United States beginning in 1957 after the initiation of animal vaccination with the Sterne vaccine, persons in certain occupations remain at higher risk for naturally occurring anthrax exposure. In contrast, the risk for bioterrorism-related anthrax is difficult to predict.\n\n【29】 #General Public\nMembers of the general public, including pregnant or breastfeeding women, are not at risk for exposure to naturally occurring anthrax but might be exposed through a bioterrorism event that would be time limited, sporadic, and most likely geographically limited, as well as difficult to predict, detect, or prevent . The target population for a bioterrorism-related release of B. anthracis cannot be predicted, and the risk for exposure cannot be reliably calculated. Once a bioterrorism event occurs, exposure and risk for disease development at the individual level are difficult to identify. No data suggest that the risk for developing anthrax is greater for pregnant women who have been exposed to B. anthracis than for nonpregnant women who have been exposed. Among children, naturally occurring cases and one confirmed case resulting from exposure during the 2001 bioterrorism events have been reported ,43. Data are limited regarding the risk for developing anthrax in children after exposure; however, the risk is assumed to be similar to the risk for adults. Like the general public, medical personnel are not at risk for exposure to naturally occurring anthrax but might be exposed through a bioterrorism event. In general, the risk for acquiring anthrax when caring for infected or contaminated patients is thought to be negligible because no person-to-person transmission or secondary cases of anthrax among medical personnel have been documented. Medical personnel are recommended to routinely follow infection control measures to minimize risk for known nosocomial infections .\n\n【30】 #Populations at Risk for occupational Exposure\nPersons who repeatedly enter potentially contaminated areas should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which is defined in this report as consisting of a powered airpurifying respirator with full-facepiece and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, disposable protective clothing with integral hood and booties, and disposable gloves . However, despite the use of appropriate PPE, exposures during repeated encounters with contaminated areas might occur because PPE is not 100% effective, individual work practices might lead to exposure, breaches in PPE and environmental controls might occur, and some breaches might not be detected .\n\n【31】 #Persons Handling Animals or Animal Products\nImprovements in industrial hygiene standards, mechanization of animal processing, animal disease control, and strict importation guidelines have reduced the risk for exposure to anthrax among manufacturing employees working with animals and animal products such as imported animal hides, furs, bone meal, wool, animal hair, or bristles , and wool and mohair processors might still be at risk for exposure to B. anthracis spores if the industry standards are not upheld.\nInhalation and cutaneous anthrax are occupational hazards primarily for workers who process hides, hair (especially from goats), bone and bone products, and wool .\nOccupational exposure to B. anthracis through contact with animals, whether in an agricultural or industrial setting, remains a risk when contact with animals with suspected or confirmed anthrax occurs. However, such human cases are rare , and cutaneous anthrax is the primary risk. Exposure to B. anthracis spores in soil is not considered a substantial risk for human inhalation anthrax because spores are bound to heavy soil particles .  Sanitary control of animal byproducts (except casings), and hay and straw, offered for entry into the United States, 9 C.F.R. Pt. 95.\n\n【32】 #Persons Working in Laboratories\nMultiple types of laboratories might work with B. anthracis, including academic (research), military, veterinary, food-testing, and public health laboratories. Direct and indirect contact with contaminated objects, accidental parenteral inoculation, and generation of aerosolized particles are all potential risks for infection. Certain activities increase the risk for exposure, such as working with large volumes and high concentrations of the organism or performing activities that might result in aerosolization, such as vortexing and centrifugation . In 2006, the Association of Public Health Laboratories website provided guidance to address sample transport, receipt, and screening of unknown environmental samples .\n\n【33】 #Persons Working in Postal Facilities\nThe distribution of letters laden with anthrax spores through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in 2001 established the mail as a feasible route of exposure. In the event of another attack through the mail, the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is presumed to be high among staff members in a USPS processing and distribution center who work with mechanical processing equipment that might generate aerosol particles. In response, USPS implemented environmental monitoring to rapidly identify the presence of B. anthracis in these centers. Detection of B. anthracis using these validated USPS monitors would identify a likely exposure (D Sosin, CDC, personal communication, October 2, 2008) and allow prompt initiation of antimicrobial PEP while laboratory verification is being performed.\n\n【34】 #Military Personnel\nThe personnel who have been determined by DoD to be at risk for exposure to B. anthracis spores include military personnel being deployed to areas designated by DoD as posing a high risk for anthrax exposure, other select military units with unique missions, civilians deemed to be essential emergency personnel in designated locations, and contractors assigned to higher risk areas who are performing mission-essential services .\n\n【35】 #Persons Involved in Emergency Response Activities Environmental Investigators and Remediation Workers\nConducting remediation of B. anthracis-contaminated areas can pose a risk for exposure to B. anthracis spores. Repeated occupational exposures might occur during environmental investigation or remediation efforts after identification of anthrax cases, regardless of whether the event is bioterrorism related. However, certain features of a bioterrorism event might result in higher risk for exposure during remediation activities. The characteristics of an intentionally dispersed strain of B. anthracis (e.g. antimicrobial resistance or dispersion capabilities) might differ from those of a naturally occurring strain. The level of environmental contamination resulting from intentionally dispersed strains, and therefore the potential for exposure at lower infective doses, might be significantly greater than the level of contamination that would result from naturally occurring strains. Because animal studies indicate that the incubation period for inhalation anthrax might be inversely related to the dose of B. anthracis spores , exposure to higher levels of spores may result in more rapid disease onset, with limited time for initiating PEP.\n\n【36】 #Emergency and other Responders\nPersons involved in emergency response activities might include persons who work in police departments, fire departments, hazardous material units, and the National Guard, as well as other government responders. These persons might perform site investigations, respond to suspicious substance reports (also known as white powder incidents), and perform other related activities such as evacuation procedures or other activities critical to the maintenance of infrastructure. The risk for potential exposures associated with responder activities varies depending on the situation. Although the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is likely low, secondary aerosolization of previously settled spores might occur during the performance of certain activities . Because the location and dissemination of the organism as a result of a bioterrorism attack cannot be predicted, the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores in association with emergency response activities cannot be quantified.\n\n【37】 #Recommended Uses of Anthrax Vaccine\nAVA may be used 1 via the licensed schedule to prevent infection by priming the immune system before exposure to B. anthracis (pre-event or preexposure vaccination) and 2 after exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores under an IND or possibly under an EUA (PEP vaccination) (Tables 2 and 3). Recommendations for the use of AVA differ for pre-event or preexposure vaccination and postexposure vaccination. For pre-event or preexposure vaccination, ACIP recommends 5 IM doses administered at day 0, week 4, and months 6, 12, and 18, followed by annual boosters. To elicit the most substantial and rapid immune response possible among previously unvaccinated persons in a postexposure setting, PEP vaccination should be administered as a 3-dose SC series (at 0, 2, and 4 weeks) in conjunction with a 60-day course of appropriate antimicrobial agents.\n\n【38】 #Pre-event and Preexposure Vaccination\nBy priming the immune system before exposure to B. anthracis spores, pre-event and preexposure vaccination might provide more protection than antimicrobial agents alone to persons at risk for occupational exposure to B. anthracis, including protection for persons exposed to large inocula, protection if the public health infrastructure cannot ensure immediate availability or timely delivery of postevent antimicrobial agents, and potential benefits if bioengineered strains were released, limiting antimicrobial PEP effectiveness. The potential benefits from pre-event and preexposure vaccination should be weighed against the resource requirements to implement and maintain the vaccination schedule, as well as the potential adverse events associated with vaccination. Decisions for pre-event vaccination should be made based on a calculated risk assessment. In the absence of such an assessment, vaccination may be considered based on an estimated/presumed risk-benefit assessment. Depending on the occupational activities of the vaccine recipient, pre-event or preexposure vaccination might not eliminate the need for appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\n【39】 #General Public\nBecause the location and timing of a bioterrorism attack cannot be predicted, the risk-benefit profile for pre-event vaccination for the general public is low, and pre-event vaccination is not recommended. Preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with a deliberate release of B. anthracis depends on public vigilance, early detection and diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and rapid administration of PEP.\n\n【40】 #Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women\nIn a pre-event setting, in which the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is presumably low, vaccination of pregnant women is not recommended and should be deferred until after pregnancy. Breastfeeding is neither a precaution nor a contraindication to vaccination, and vaccination does not need to be deferred in a pre-event setting if the occupation of the breastfeeding mother poses a risk for exposure to B. anthracis.\n\n【41】 #Children\nIn a pre-event setting, in which the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is presumably low, vaccination of children is not recommended.\n\n【42】 #Medical Personnel\nPre-event vaccination is not recommended for medical personnel. If exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores during a bioterrorism event, they should receive PEP in accordance with ACIP recommendations.\n\n【43】 #Populations at Risk for occupational Exposure Persons Handling Animals or Animal Products\nRoutine preexposure vaccination for persons who handle animals or animal products is recommended only for persons for whom previously discussed standards and restrictions are insufficient to prevent exposure to B. anthracis spores. Preexposure vaccination is not recommended for persons who routinely have contact with animal hide drums or animal hides; other preventive measures are available.\n\n【44】 #Laboratorians\nPreexposure vaccination is recommended for laboratorians at risk for repeated exposure to fully virulent B. anthracis spores, such as those who 1 work with high concentrations of spores with potential for aerosol production; 2 handle environmental samples that might contain powders and are associated with anthrax investigations; 3 routinely work with pure cultures of B. anthracis; 4 frequently work in spore-contaminated areas after a bioterrorism attack; or 5 work in other settings where repeated exposures to B. anthracis aerosols may occur.\n\n【45】 #Persons Working in Postal Processing Facilities\nBecause of biodetection systems in postal processing centers, contamination of mail with B. anthracis spores is likely to be detected rapidly, allowing postexposure therapy to be initiated immediately. Therefore, persons who work in these facilities are not recommended to receive pre-event vaccination.\n\n【46】 #Military Personnel\nMilitary personnel determined by DoD to have a calculable risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores are recommended to receive preexposure vaccination. DoD has exclusionary criteria for employees, including an exclusion for pre-event vaccination of pregnant women .\n\n【47】 #Environmental Investigators and Remediation Workers\nVaccination is recommended for persons who, as part of their occupation, might repeatedly enter areas contaminated with B. anthracis spores.\n\n【48】 #Emergency and other Responders\nEmergency and other responders are not recommended to receive routine pre-event anthrax vaccination because of the lack of a calculable risk assessment. However, responder units engaged in response activities that might lead to exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores may offer their workers voluntary pre-event vaccination. The vaccination program should be carried out under the direction of a comprehensive occupational health and safety program.\n\n【49】 #Delayed Doses\nAvailable data on AVA dosages suggest that increasing the interval between doses does not decrease the ultimate serologic response achieved or adversely affect the safety profile. Therefore, as with other vaccines, interruption of the vaccination schedule does not require restarting the entire series or the addition of extra doses .\n\n【50】 #PEP\nPEP should be used for previously unvaccinated persons after exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, whether the exposure is naturally occurring, occupationally related, or intentional. To elicit the most substantial and rapid immune response possible for previously unvaccinated persons in a postexposure setting, vaccination should be administered as recommended in conjunction with appropriate antimicrobial agents (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n【51】 #PEP After Inhalation Exposure\nGeneral Adult Population ACIP recommends a postexposure regimen of 60 days of appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis combined with 3 SC doses of AVA (administered at 0, 2, and 4 weeks postexposure) as the most effective protection against inhalation anthrax for previously unvaccinated persons aged ≥18 years who have been exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores.\nAfter exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. Ideally, the first dose of vaccine should be administered within 10 days. Because AVA is not licensed for postexposure use, the vaccine will likely be made available either through an IND or an EUA during a public health emergency.\nIn general, the peak serologic response to anthrax vaccine occurs 10-14 days after the third dose. To ensure continued protection, persons for whom vaccination has been delayed should extend antimicrobial use to 14 days after the third dose, even though this practice might result in use of antimicrobials for >60 days. Antimicrobials should not be used for <60 days in previously unvaccinated persons who have been exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis spores.\n\n【52】 #Pregnant Women\nIn a postevent setting that poses a high risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, pregnancy is neither a precaution nor a contraindication to PEP. Pregnant women at risk for inhalation anthrax should receive AVA and 60 days of antimicrobial therapy as described.\n\n【53】 #Breastfeeding Women\nIn a postevent setting that poses a high risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, breastfeeding remains neither a precaution nor a contraindication to PEP. Breastfeeding women at risk for inhalation anthrax should receive AVA and 60 days of antimicrobial therapy as described.\n\n【54】 #Children\nThe use of AVA in children is not contraindicated in a postevent setting that poses a high risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores. During such an event, public health authorities will determine whether, under the existing IND protocol, to offer vaccine to children aged 0-17 years. Under this IND protocol, 3 doses of vaccine would be administered in conjunction with 60 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【55】 #PEP After Repeated occupational Exposures\nThe combination of pre-event vaccine and appropriate PPE effectively protects fully vaccinated persons who work in occupations that might result in repeated exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores . Antimicrobial PEP is not needed for fully vaccinated workers who wear appropriate PPE while working in environments contaminated with B. anthracis spores unless the PPE is disrupted. However, fully vaccinated workers who prefer additional protection may consider antimicrobial PEP under the direction of their occupational health program A 30-day course of antimicrobial PEP is recommended for partially vaccinated workers , fully vaccinated workers who do not wear PPE, and fully vaccinated workers whose PPE has been disrupted; these workers should continue with their licensed vaccination regimen.  Because respiratory protection can be disrupted in numerous ways (e.g. a face-seal leak in a respirator or not wearing personal protective equipment when entering an area presumed to be uncontaminated that is later determined to be contaminated) and such disruptions are not always detected, the threshold for assuming such a disruption has occurred should be extremely low.  Fully vaccinated workers have completed the 5-dose IM series and have received all annual booster doses indicated by the licensed vaccination schedule.\nA 60-day course of antimicrobial PEP is recommended for previously unvaccinated workers. These workers also should begin receiving AVA as soon as possible using the PEP schedule of 3 SC doses.\n\n【56】 #PEP After naturally occurring Cutaneous or Gastrointestinal Exposure\nVaccination is not recommended after cutaneous or gastrointestinal exposures that pose no risk for inhalation exposure. When a naturally occurring cutaneous exposure occurs, appropriate medical and public health personnel should be notified, and affected persons should be monitored for development of a spot, pimple, or boil-like lesion, especially in the exposed areas. For persons who experience a naturally occurring gastrointestinal exposure, such those who eat meat from an undercooked carcass of an anthrax-infected animal, antimicrobial PEP for 7-14 days may be considered.\n\n【57】 #Contraindication and Precautions for Use of AVA\nThe following contraindication and precautions are relevant for both preexposure and postexposure settings .\n\n【58】 #Contraindication\nAlthough anaphylaxis after anthrax vaccination is extremely rare and no anaphylaxis deaths associated with AVA have been reported (CDC, unpublished data, 2010), an anaphylactic reaction can be life-threatening. Therefore, AVA is contraindicated for persons who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction after a previous dose of AVA or any of the vaccine components.\n\n【59】 #Latex allergy:\nBecause the vaccine vial stopper contains dry, natural rubber, caution should be used when administering the vaccine to persons with a latex allergy . Epinephrine solution (1:1000) should be available for immediate use in the event that an anaphylactic reaction occurs.\n\n【60】 #History of anthrax disease:\nA history of anthrax disease might increase the potential for severe local adverse reactions after AVA administration .\n\n【61】 #Impaired immune response:\nPatients with an impaired immune response might not be adequately immunized after administration of AVA . Moderate or severe acute illness:\nIn a standard preexposure vaccination program, vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illness should be postponed until after recovery . In a postevent setting, the risks of administering vaccine to a person who has been exposed to anthrax but has moderate or severe acute illness should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination. Vaccine may be administered to persons who have a mild illness with or without a low-grade fever.\n\n【62】 #Reporting Adverse Events\nAdverse events that occur after administration of anthrax vaccine should be reported to VAERS, regardless of whether the reporter considers the vaccine to be the cause of the event. Information about VAERS and how to report vaccine adverse events is available at . Adverse events that occur after administration of antimicrobial agents should be reported to the FDA MedWatch program at .\n\n【63】 #Current and Future Research\nResearch priorities for future studies on the currently licensed anthrax vaccine should include immunogenicity; additional evaluations of the dosing schedule (including the maximum time between boosters); additional long-term human safety studies; the number of vaccine doses required for PEP; the optimal duration of antimicrobial use in postexposure settings; antimicrobial susceptibility and treatment studies; optimal alternative antimicrobial agents for children, older adults (aged >65 years), and pregnant women; and the safety of anthrax vaccine in clinical toxicology studies among pregnant animals. Future research should include the groups for whom AVA is currently licensed, as well as children, older adults, and pregnant women. These research questions also should be addressed as new potential anthrax vaccines are identified and considered for use in humans.\n\n【64】 #Research on AVA and Future Anthrax Vaccines: Immunogenicity, Schedule, and Route\nResearch is ongoing to address priority topics, including identification of quantitative immune correlates of protection in relevant animal species and defining the quantitative relationship between the vaccine-elicited immune response in these animal species and humans. Completion of the ongoing AVRP clinical trial should provide a definitive clinical evaluation of the effects of reducing the number of AVA doses .\nFuture research should include trials to obtain this information and to develop dosage recommendations for children. In addition, research to further develop both the recombinant PA (rPA) vaccines and the next generation of anthrax vaccines should continue.\n\n【65】 #Postexposure Prophylaxis\nStudies in animals indicate that the combination of antimicrobials and vaccination is very effective for preventing systemic B. anthracis infection. When using a combined approach the immune system benefits from the acute-phase antimicrobial protection provided against germinating spores and vegetative cells of B. anthracis while gaining enough time to complete immunological priming and establish anamnestic capability (i.e. immunological memory) . The effectiveness of vaccination might allow the antimicrobial course to be shortened from the recommended 60 days to as few as 14 days . Definitive, pivotal human studies to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the human immune response to anthrax vaccines when combined with antimicrobials have not been conducted. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal duration of antimicrobial administration in conjunction with the optimal doses of vaccine.\n\n【66】 #Long-term Safety of AVA\nThe FDA final order for use of AVA emphasizes the need to continue postmarketing safety studies , and the IOM reports document the need for additional long-term follow-up of vaccine recipients , and assessments of new safety signals identified from VAERS or other sources.\n\n【67】 #Alternative Anthrax Vaccines\nThe rPA vaccines contain the purified protein of an avirulent, non-spore-forming strain of B. anthracis . Although recent phase 1 dose-escalation studies comparing rPA with AVA for reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and dosing range of rPA have been conducted .

The existence of this phenomenon was discovered in 1972 by French physicist Francis Perrin.  The conditions under which a natural nuclear reactor could exist were predicted in 1956 by P. Kuroda. The conditions found at Oklo were very similar to what were predicted.\nAt the only known location, three ore deposits at Oklo in Gabon, sixteen sites have been discovered so far at which self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions took place approximately 1.5 billion years ago, and ran for a few hundred thousand years, averaging 100 kW of power output during that time.\n\n【1】 #History\nIn May 1972 at the Pierrelatte uranium enrichment facility in France, routine mass spectrometry comparing UF6 samples from the Oklo Mine, located in Gabon, Central Africa, showed a discrepancy in the amount of the 235U isotope.  Normally the concentration is 0.7202%; these samples had only 0.7171% – a significant difference. This discrepancy required explanation, as all uranium handling facilities must meticulously account for all fissionable isotopes to assure that none are diverted for weapons purposes. Thus the French Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA) began an investigation. A series of measurements of the relative abundances of the two most significant isotopes of the uranium mined at Oklo showed anomalous results compared to those obtained for uranium from other mines. Further investigations into this uranium deposit discovered uranium ore with a 235U to 238U ratio as low as 0.440%.  Subsequent examination of other isotopes showed similar anomalies, such as Nd and Ru as described in more detail below.\nThis loss in 235U is exactly what happens in a nuclear reactor.  A possible explanation therefore was that the uranium ore had operated as a natural fission reactor. Other observations led to the same conclusion, and on September 25 1972, the CEA announced their finding that self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions had occurred on Earth about 2 billion years ago. Later, other natural nuclear fission reactors were discovered in the region.\n\n【2】 ## Nd\nNeodymium and other elements were found with isotopic compositions different from what is customarily found on Earth. For example, natural neodymium contains 27% 142Nd; the Nd at Oklo contained less than 6% but contained more 143Nd. Subtracting the natural isotopic Nd abundance from the Oklo-Nd, the isotopic composition matched that produced by the fissioning of 235U.\n\n【3】 ## Ru\nSimilar investigations into the isotopic ratios of ruthenium at Oklo found a much higher 99Ru concentration than expected (27-30% vs. 12.7%). This anomaly could be explained by the decay of 99Tc to 99Ru. In the bar chart below the normal natural isotope signature of ruthenium is compared with that for fission product ruthenium which is the result of the fission of 235U with thermal neutrons. It is clear that the fission ruthenium has a different isotope signature. The level of 100Ru in the fission product mixture is low because of a long lived (half life = 1019 years) isotope of molybdenum. On the time scale of when the reactors were in operation very little decay to 100Ru will have occurred.\n\n【4】 #Mechanism of the reactors\nThe natural nuclear reactor formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a nuclear chain reaction took place. The heat generated from the nuclear fission caused the groundwater to boil away, which slowed or stopped the reaction.  After cooling of the mineral deposit, short-lived fission product poisons decayed, the water returned and the reaction started again.  These fission reactions were sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, until a chain reaction could no longer be supported.\nFission of uranium normally produces five known isotopes of the fission-product gas xenon; all five have been found trapped within novel aluminium foams in the remnants of the natural reactor, in varying concentrations.  The concentrations of xenon isotopes, found trapped in mineral formations 2 billion years later, make it possible to calculate the specific time intervals of reactor operation: approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.\nA key factor that made the reaction possible was that, at the time the reactor went critical, the fissile isotope 235U made up about 3% of the natural uranium, which is comparable to the amount used in some of today's reactors. (The remaining 97% was non-fissile 238U.) Because 235U has a shorter half life than 238U, and thus decays more rapidly, the current abundance of 235U in natural uranium is about 0.7%. A natural nuclear reactor is therefore no longer possible on Earth.\nAnother factor which probably contributed to the start of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor at 2 billion years, rather than earlier, was the increasing oxygen content in the earth's atmosphere.  Uranium is naturally present in the rocks of the earth, and the abundance of fissionable 235U was at least 3% or higher at all times prior to reactor startup.  However, uranium is soluble in water only in the presence of oxygen.  Therefore, the rising oxygen levels during the aging of earth may have allowed uranium to be dissolved and transported with groundwater to places where a high enough concentration could accumulate to form rich uranium ore bodies.  Without the new aerobic environment available on earth at the time, these concentrations probably couldn't have taken place.\nIt is estimated that secondary enrichment of the uranium in centimeter- to meter-sized veins consumed about six tons of 235U and elevated temperatures to a few hundred degrees Celsius. Remarkably, the non-volatile fission products have only moved a few centimeters in the veins during the last 1.5 billion years. This offers a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the earth's crust—a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic nuclear waste disposal fear that releases from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n【5】 #Relation to the atomic fine-structure constant\nThe natural reactor of Oklo has been used to check if the atomic fine-structure constant \\alpha might have changed over the past 2 billion years. That is because \\alpha influences the rate of various nuclear reactions. For example, 149Sm captures a neutron to become 150Sm, and since the rate of neutron capture depends on the value of \\alpha, the ratio of the two samarium isotopes in samples from Oklo can be used to calculate the value of \\alpha from 2 billion years ago.\nSeveral studies have analysed the relative concentrations of radioactive isotopes left behind at Oklo, and most (but not all) have concluded that nuclear reactions then were much the same as they are today, which implies alpha was the same too.\n\n【6】 #In fiction\nIn Manifold: Space by Stephen Baxter, a far-future feudalist society exploits a naturally occurring fission reactor for power.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:32:49"}

Hypoplasia of the heart is rare but is the most serious form of congenital heart defect; it is called hypoplastic left heart syndrome when it affects the left side of the heart and hypoplastic right heart syndrome when it affects the right side of the heart.  In both conditions, the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (and, when hypoplasia affects the right side of the heart, a patent foramen ovale) is vital to the infant's ability to survive until emergency heart surgery can be performed, since without these pathways blood cannot circulate to the body (or lungs, depending on which side of the heart is defective).  Hypoplasia of the heart is generally a cyanotic heart defect.\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. In babies with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are very small, and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether.  As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it must pass through an atrial septal defect to the right side of the heart.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\nIn patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\n\n【3】 #Causes\nAs with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\n\n【4】 #Differentiating Hypoplastic left heart syndrome from other Diseases\nSigns and symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may be similar to other conditions. A differential diagnosis is essential to definitively diagnose hypoplastic left heart syndrome from associated conditions.\n\n【5】 #Risk Factors\nHypoplastic left heart is more common in males than in females.\n\n【6】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nFailure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. However, with treatment, infants have a good chance at survival well into late adulthood. Potential complications may develop such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and even neurological complications.\n\n【7】 ## History and Symptoms\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. Common symptoms include cyanosis, dyspnea, and poor circulation.\n\n【8】 ## Physical Examination\nA physical examination is an integral part of diagnosing hypoplastic left heart syndrome. During a routine visit, a doctor may find signs of right ventricle enlargement, presence of additional birth defects, and hemodynamic imbalances.\n\n【9】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory studies that should be ordered include a complete blood count, and an arterial blood gas.\n\n【10】 ## Electocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram should be ordered if hypoplastic left heart syndrome is suspected. Findings that may be depicted are right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and prominent p waves.\n\n【11】 ## Chest X Ray\nFindings on chest x ray include increased markings of pulmonary vasculature, and cardiomegaly.\n\n【12】 ## Echocardiography\nThe echocardiogram is of high diagnostic value in the assessment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Doppler echocardiography will also help in visualizing the flow in the ventricles.\n\n【13】 ## Medical Therapy\nFailure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. Medical therapy can be used prior to surgical intervention to allow the ductus to open and promote bloodflow. It is only a temporary solution, surgical intervention is needed to ultimately repair hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\n【14】 ## Surgery\nFailure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. Surgical therapy is the only true way to treat and permanently fix hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Two main methods exist for treatment: transplantation and a three-stage surgical procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 21:57:00"}

NPD is a maladaptive, rigid, and persistent condition that may cause significant distress and functional impairment.  Narcissistic personality disorder is a \"cluster B\" personality disorder.  The ICD-10 ,International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders, published by the World Health Organisation in Geneva in 1992, regards narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) as \"a personality disorder that fits none of the specific rubrics,\" relegating it to the category known as \"Other specific personality disorders.\" This category also includes the eccentric, \"haltlose,\" immature, passive-aggressive, and psychoneurotic personality disorders. Men are more commonly afflicted with NPD than women. The primary consequences of NPD are social. Interpersonal relationships often suffer due to the patient’s sense of entitlement and disregard for the feelings of others, which may manifest as manipulation, infidelity, or violence. Disruptions to relationships may give rise to anxiety or depression in an NPD patient.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nThe term narcissistic personality disorder was first used by Heinz Kohut in 1971. In 1980, NPD became a diagnostic category as defined by the DSM. From the publication of the DSM-III to the DSM-IV, which was released in 1994, professional thought shifted from considering the primary characteristic of NPD an inability to empathize with others to an unwillingness to consider or try to understand others' feelings.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nNo formal classification scheme exists for NPD.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nIt has been suggested that certain neurological defects that are common in NPD patients (i.e. frontolimbic dysfunctions) may predispose sufferers to such neurodegenerative diseases as dementia. Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to confirm this association.\n\n【5】 ## Common Comorbid Conditions\nNPD is found in individuals suffering from psychopathy in approximately 21% of cases; in BPD patients in 37-39% of cases; and in substance abuse disorder patients in 11.8% of cases. Mood disorders and PTSD are also commonly comorbid with NPD. Dysthymia is strongly negatively correlated with incidence of NPD.\n\n【6】 #Causes\nThe cause of NPD is unknown. Neurological and environmental factors may both play a role.\nPotentially relevant environmental factors may include:\n- An oversensitive temperament at birth\n- Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents\n- Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own self-esteem\n- Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback\n- Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents\n- Severe emotional abuse in childhood\n- Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or talents by adults\n- Learning manipulative behaviors from parents\nPsychologists commonly believe that pathological narcissism results from an impairment in the quality of the person’s relationship with their primary caregivers, usually their parents, in that the parents were unable to form a healthy, empathic attachment to them. This results in the child conceiving of themselves as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe that he or she has some defect of personality which makes them unvalued and unwanted.\n\n【7】 #Differential Diagnosis\nNPD must be differentiated from other mental disorders which present with similar symptomology, including:\n- Antisocial personality disorder\nNPD patients are most effectively differentiated from ASPD patients by their grandiosity—the propensity to misrepresent themselves or their abilities as unique and superior to others.\nSome experts suggest that ASPD would best be defined as a subgroup of NPD.\n- NPD patients are more likely to have a steady job and less likely to be institutionalized/incarcerated, while ASPD patients are more likely to actively exploit or abuse other people.\n- Borderline personality disorder\nBoth NPD and BPD patients are hyper-sensitive and prone to overreact to criticism or perceived slights. They are also less likely to maintain healthy and fulfilling interpersonal relationships.\nIn BPD, anxiety and depression are endemic to the disorder, whereas in NPD, this type of distress may result as a secondary consequence of the personality disorder, resulting from defects in interpersonal functioning that define the symptomology of NPD.\n- Psychopathy\nPsychopathy and NPD are both associated with a sense of superiority to others and a lack of empathy. NPD patients are less likely to exhibit manipulative and duplicitous behavior.\n\n【8】 ## Prevalence\nThe lifetime prevalence of narcissistic personality disorder is from 6,200 per 100,000 (6.2%) of the overall population.\n\n【9】 ## Age\nNPD most commonly presents in young adults, though it has been observed in patients in their later years as well.\n\n【10】 ## Gender\nMales are more commonly afflicted with NPD than females, though the extent of the disparity is unclear.\n\n【11】 ## Race\nNPD is most common among Black men and women and Hispanic women.\n\n【12】 #Risk Factors\nRisk factors for the development of NPD include:\n- Adolescence\n- Male gender (50-75%)\n- Genetic predisposition\n- Being unmarried\n- Excess admiration or neglect by parents\n- Emotional abuse or manipulation\n\n【13】 #Screening\nNo formal screening recommendations exist for NPD.\n\n【14】 ## Natural History\nCurrent research aims to define the neurological underpinnings of the development of NPD. Certain neurological defects that are common in NPD patients (i.e. frontolimbic dysfunctions) may predispose them to neurodegenerative diseases later in life, particularly dementia.\n\n【15】 ## Complications\nThe primary consequences of NPD are social. Interpersonal relationships often suffer due to the patient’s sense of entitlement and disregard for the feelings of others, which may manifest as manipulation, infidelity, or violence. Disruptions to relationships may give rise to anxiety or depression in an NPD patient. Similarly, the behavior and viewpoints of NPD patients may even cause mental health clinicians to harbor negative feelings toward them, which could impair treatment.\nIn some cases, questionable decision-making on the part of patients suffering from NPD may give rise to dire situations or life crises, under which circumstances a patient may require immediate medical attention. A lapse of this nature may also lead to suicide.\n\n【16】 ## Prognosis\nNarcissism is associated with a broad spectrum of intensity, ranging from socially acceptable and even healthy or professionally beneficial to pathological and destructive. The prognosis of NPD depends on the severity of its presentation in a given patient and the patient’s willingness to seek treatment. Since NPD patients often turn to healthcare to address psychological distress that occurs as a result of personal or academic/professional failures, sufferers who are able to circumvent such failures may be particularly unlikely to seek treatment.\nPoor prognostic factors include:\n- Vulnerability in self-esteem\n- Intolerance to criticism\n- Feelings of humiliation and self-criticism\n- Histrionic, borderline, antisocial and/or paranoid personality disorders\n\n【17】 ### DSM-V Diagnositic Criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder\nThe essential features of a personality disorder are impairments in personality (self and interpersonal) functioning and the presence of pathological personality traits. To diagnose narcissistic personality disorder, the following criteria must be met:\n\n【18】 ## ICD-10 Criteria\nWhile the ICD-10 does not specifically define the characteristics of this personality disorder, it is classified in the category \"Other Specific Personality Disorders\".\nICD-10 states that Narcissistic Personality Disorder is \"a personality disorder that fits none of the specific rubrics F60.0-F60.7.\" That is, this personality disorder does not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the following:\n- F60.0 Paranoid Personality Disorder\n\n【19】 ## History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of narcissistic personality disorder include:\n- Grandiosity\n- Need for admiration\n- Intense fear of rejection, isolation, and/or loss of admiration or respect\n- Lack of empathy (coupled with a sense of entitlement that pervades interpersonal relationships)\nDeficits in emotional empathy are generally stronger than those in cognitive empathy. Problems with cognitive empathy may be rooted in a lack of motivation rather than an actual inability.\nThis general lack of empathy in NPD patients may be particularly likely to manifest as racism.\n- Tendency to exploit others, possibly subconsciously\n- Arrogance\n- Envy\n- Interpersonal distancing and avoidance\n- Insecurity and vulnerability\n- Hypersensitivity\n- Aggressiveness\n- Proneness to shame\n\n【20】 ## Physical Examination\nThe gold standard for diagnosing NPD is the Diagnostic Interview for Narcissism, which consists of 33 questions evaluating a patient's functional status in five areas: grandiosity, interpersonal relations, reactiveness, affects and moods, and social and moral adaptation. The questionnaire has good internal consistency and acceptable inter-rater reliability.\n\n【21】 ## Laboratory Findings\nNo laboratory findings are considered diagnostic of NPD.\n\n【22】 ## Imaging Findings\nNo imaging findings are currently considered diagnostic of NPD, though frontolimbic dysfunctions may be present, and may predispose sufferers to such neurodegenerative diseases as dementia.\n\n【23】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nAssessment modalities include self-reporting through the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 and Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI).\n\n【24】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe mainstay of treatment for NPD is psychotherapy, though suffering as a result of the disorder itself is rarely the reason a patient will seek treatment. Commonly, patients are urged to seek psychiatric counsel by family members or loved ones; they may also seek treatment for a different but related condition, such as major depressive disorder or an eating disorder. Treatment aims to help patients control their impulsivity and aggression while encouraging them to be more empathetic and less entitled. No specific medications have proven particularly effective in the treatment of NPD, though medication may be required to treat a co-occurring disorder.\n\n【25】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is not indicated for the treatment of NPD.\n\n【26】 ### Primary Prevention\nPrimary prevention of NPD involves the maintenance of a stable home life throughout childhood and the avoidance of excessive flattery or emotional manipulation by parents or caregivers.\n\n【27】 ### Secondary Prevention\nNo strategies are indicated for the secondary prevention of NPD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:31:10"}

These products are intended for use in smoking cessation efforts to help deal with withdrawal symptoms and cravings caused by the loss of nicotine from cigarettes. Several forms of NRT have been marketed, including the nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray, gum, sublingual tablet, and lozenge. NRT is thought to be useful and beneficial for tobacco users who want to quit their addiction and is for most people perfectly safe. Cigarettes on the other hand cause the early deaths of about 5 million people each year. These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette, but by other constituents of tobacco smoke such as Carbon Monoxide and tars. It is the nicotine that keeps the smoker addicted. Cigarettes can be viewed as a \"dirty\" and dangerous method of delivering nicotine, while NRT is a \"clean\" and safe method.\nNRT delivers nicotine to the smokers brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do. It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting, rather than remove them totally. It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives, and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit. NRT however is best used with some form of support, ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation.\nIn 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and also to adolescent smokers. However, in the opinion of many independent nicotine researchers, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines has got its new advice on NRT dramatically wrong.  Tobacco researchers who have received funding from the pharmaceutical industry have acted as consultants to the Committee.\nGinzel et al.  reviewed the dangers of nicotine for the developing brain (Journal of Health Psychology 12, 215). Recent diversification of nicotine products and their placement on the free market are solely in the interest of industry and will not help to reduce youth smoking, but could serve as a gateway drug for nonsmokers. The recommendation of ASH to use NRT even without stopping smoking will create dependencies on both cigarettes and NRT (used simultaneously or alternating), again in the interest of industry only. Family doctors will be appropriately cautious about prescribing a drug that is a poison and carries many potential dangers to the foetus and adolescent smokers and indeed to all smokers who use NRT and yet continue to smoke tobacco.\nA small number of people who use NRT, especially Nasal Spray and Nicotine Gum, will go on to use it on a longer term basis. These are usually highly nicotine dependent smokers who would not have been able to quit without the help of such medication. There is currently no evidence that such long term usage is harmful to health, especially when compared to smoking.\nFindings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products (REFERENCE NEEDED) indicated that smokers using NRT were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be abstinent from smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition.  However, this statement is controversial, and critics have pointed out that real-world trials rather than artificial ones yield results for NRT that are hardly better than those obtained for non-NRT controls.\n\n【1】 #Types\n- Nicotine patch", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:11:35"}

Thus the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name bimolecular nucleophilic substitution, or SN2. The somewhat more transparently named analog to SN2 among inorganic chemists is the interchange mechanism.\n\n【2】 #Reaction mechanism\nThe reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it - 'X' - frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentavalent, and approximately sp2 hybridised. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180° to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C-X σ- antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed.\nIf the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, this leads to an inversion of stereochemistry, called the Walden inversion.\nIn an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of OH− (the nucleophile) on a bromoethane (the electrophile) results in ethanol, with bromide ejected as the leaving group.\nSN2 attack occurs if the backside route of attack is not sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate. Therefore this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon centre. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon centre, the substitution will involve an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would also be more likely in this case because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed.)\n\n【3】 #Reaction kinetics\nThe rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration,  as well as the concentration of substrate.\nThis is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over, whereas in SN2 the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In cases where both mechanisms are possible (for example at a secondary carbon centre), the mechanism depends on solvent, temperature, concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group.\nSN2 reactions are generally favoured in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent. They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance.\nIt is important to understand that SN2 and SN1 are two extremes of a sliding scale of reactions, it is possible to find many reactions which exhibit both SN2 and SN1 character in their mechanisms. For instance, it is possible to get a contact ion pairs formed from an alkyl halide in which the ions are not fully separated. When these undergo substitution the stereochemistry will be inverted (as in SN2) for many of the reacting molecules but a few may show retention of configuration.\n\n【4】 #E2 Competition\nA common side reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2 elimination when the incoming anion, acting as a base rather than as the nucleophile, abstracts a proton and forms the alkene. This effect can be demonstated in the gas-phase reaction between an phenoxide and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer :\nWith ethyl bromide the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product but as steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases as in isopropyl bromide elimination takes the upper hand.  Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With the less basic benzoate substrate isopropyl bromide reacts with 55% substitution. In general gas phase reaction and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends even though in the first solvent effects are eliminated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:28:35"}

By convention, a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute in the adult patient is called bradycardia. Not all bradycardias require medical treatment. Many athletes have a slow resting heart rate. In addition, the heart rate is known to slow down with age. It is only when bradycardia causes signs and symptoms of shock that it requires emergency treatment with transcutaneous pacing.\nSome common causes of hemodynamically significant bradycardia include acute myocardial infarction, sinus node dysfunction and complete heart block. Transcutaneous pacing is no longer indicated for the treatment of asystole (cardiac arrest associated with a \"flat line\" on the ECG), with the possible exception of witnessed asystole (as in the case of bifascicular block that progresses to complete heart block without an escape rhythm).\n\n【3】 #Techniques\nDuring transcutaneous pacing, pads are placed on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The anterior/posterior position is preferred as it minimizes transthoracic impedance by \"sandwiching\" the left ventricle between the two pads. The pads are then attached to a monitor/defibrillator, a heart rate is selected, and current (measured in milliamps) is increased until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is obtained, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. It is therefore advisable to use another instrument (e.g. SpO2 monitor or bedside doppler) to confirm mechanical capture.\n\n【4】 #Disadvantages\nTranscutaneous pacing may be uncomfortable for the patient. Sedation should therefore be considered. Prolonged transcutaneous pacing may cause burns on the skin. It is meant to stabilize the patient until a more permanent means of pacing is achieved.\n\n【5】 #Others\nOther forms of cardiac pacing are transvenous pacing, epicardial pacing, and permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:51:43"}

Branches of the fifth, seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerve along with cervical nerves 1, 2, and 3 all contribute to sensation in the middle ear, external auditory canal, auricle, and peri-auricular tissues. Irritation of any portion of these cranial nerves can result in otalgia.otalgia can be the manifestation of myocardial ischemia (ie, an angina equivalent) because the vagus nerve provides sensory innervations for both structures.\n\n【2】 ## Life Threatening Causes\nOtalgia is not life-threatening, but some characteristics make a serious diagnosis more likely in patients with Otalgia. As patients who are 50 years or older have coronary artery disease, have diabetes, or are immunocompromised are at higher risk. Also, patients who smoke, drink alcohol, or lose weight unintentionally should undergo more scrutiny.

Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering HBV nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors to patients with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Including complete AV block and Wenkebach.\nJunctional tachycardia\nAtrialtachycardia\nVentricular ectopia, bigemini, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia\nIntoxication can lead to a SA-block or AV-block, sometimes in combination with a tachycardia. NB these effects are increased by hypokaliemia. In extreme high concentrations rhythmdisturbances (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation) may develop.\n\n【2】 ## Anti-arhythmics\n- anti-arhythmics: These may lead to several ECG-changes;\nbroad and irregulair P-wave broad QRS-complex prolonged QT-interval (brady-, tachycardia, AV-block, ventricular tachycardia)\nprominent U-wave\nIn case of intoxication, the above mentioned characteristics are more prominent\nAdditionally, several arrhtythmias can be seen.\n\n【3】 #Myocarditis\nMyocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium and the interstitium. The symptoms are faint chestpain, abnormal heartrate and progressive heartfailure. It can be caused by several factors: viral, bacterial, fungi, parasites, spirochaet, auto-immune, borreliosis (Lyme's disease) and HIV/AIDS.\nAcute peri/myocarditis causes aspecific ST changes. These can be accompanied with supraventricular and ventricular rhythmdisturbances and T-wave abnormalities.\n\n【4】 #Pulmonary embolism\n\n【5】 #Chronic pulmonary disease pattern\nThe ECG shows low voltaged QRS-complexes in leads I, II, and III and a right axisdeviation. This is caused by the increased pressure on the right chamber. This leads to right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【6】 #Pacemaker\n\n【7】 #Tamponade\nIn case of a tamponade, fluid collects in the pericardium. As the pericardium is stiff, the heart is compressed resulting in relaxation, and thus, filling difficulties. This is a potential life-threatening situation and should be treated with pericardiocenteses, which is drainage of the fluid. Tamponade can be the results of pericarditis or myocarditis. Also, after a myocardial infarction a tamponade may develop, this is called Dresslers' Syndrome. In case of cancer, pericardial fluid may develop. This is usually caused by a Pericarditis carcinomatosa, meaning that the cancer has spread to the pericardium\nThe ECG shows:\n- Sinus tachycardia - Low-voltaged QRS complexes microvoltages\n- Alternation of the QRS complexes, usually in a 2:1 ratio. Electrical alternans can also be seen in myocardial ischemia, acute pulmonary embolism, and tachyarrhythmias\n- PR segment depression (this can also be observed in an atrial infarction)\n\n【8】 #Ventricular Aneurysm\nThe ECG pattern suggests an acute MI. All classical signs of MI may occur:; Q-waves, ST-elevations (>1mm, >4 weeks present)and T-wave inversions are present. To exclude an acute MI, comparison with old ECG's is compulsory (MI has occurred years before).\n\n【9】 #Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nOften, a LBBB or broadened QRS-complex can be seen.

Since then, many publications have occurred discribing ECG changes after acute neurological events.\nDe ECG changes that may occur are:\n- q-waves\n- ST-elevations, - T-wave changes. Large negative T waves over the precordial leads are observed frequently.\n- prolonged QT-interval.\nThese abnormalites are frequently seen after subarachnoid_hemorrhage (SAH) (if measured serially, almost every SAH patients has at least one abnormal ECG.), but also in subdural haematoma, ischemic CVA's, brain Tumors, Guillain BarrÃ, epilepsy and migraine. The ECG changes are generally reversible and have linited prognostic value. However, the ECG changes can be accompanied with myocardial damage and echocardiographic changes. The cause of the ECG changes is not yet cl;ear. The most common hypothesis is that of a neurotramittor \"catecholaminestorm\" caused by sympathtic stimulation.\n\n【14】 #Cardiac contusion\nCardiac contusion (in latin: contusio cordis or commotio cordis) is caused by a blunt trauma to the chest, often caused by a car- or motorbikeaccident or in martial artsMaron. Rhythmdisturbances may occur and even heartfailure. Diagnosis is made using echocardiography and laboratorytesting for cardiac enzymes.\nPossible ECG changes are:Sybrandy\nNot-specific changes\n- Pericarditis-like ST elevation or PTa depression\n- Prolonged QT interval\nMyocardial damage\n- New Q waves\n- ST-T segment elevation or depression\nConduction delay\n- Right bundelbranchblok\n- Fascicular blok\n- AV delay(1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree AV blok)\nArrhythmias\n- Sinustachycardia - Atrial and ventricular extrasystoles\n- Atrial fibrillation\n- Ventricular tachycardia\n\n【15】 #Lown Ganong Levine Syndrome\nThe Lown Ganong Levine Syndrome is a pre-excitation syndrome in which the atria are connected to the lower part of the AV node or bundle of His.

The folding process of the HLA-B27 heavy chain is slower than that of other HLA alleles thus leading to the generation of misfolded chains.\n- Misfolded chains are usually removed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but in certain conditions, such as viral infection, they accumulate thus activating the protein BiP, the endoplasmic reticulum-unfolded-protein-response (UPR) and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which play a critical role in the induction of inflammation.\n- Data suggest that deposition of β2m, caused by the high dissociation rate between the HLA-B27 heavy chain and β2m, occurring within synovial tissue, may lead to the initiation of chronic inflammation.\n- Other HLA genes have been associated with SpA in IBD: HLA-DrB10103, HLA-B35, HLA-B24 in type 1 peripheral arthritis, and HLA-B44 in type 2 peripheral arthritis.\n- Moreover, Mielants et al.\n- Further confirming the relevance of HLA-B27 in the pathogenesis of enteroarthritis, Hammer et al. studied transgenic rats overexpressing HLA-B27 molecule. These rats developed a multisystemic inflammatory disease that had several clinical and histopathological similarities to SpA and IBD .\n- In humans with reactive arthritis, following Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella spp.\n- Other molecular studies found similarities between Klebsiella nitrogenase and HLA-B27 and between Klebsiella pullulanase and collagen fibers types I, III, and IV.\n- Interestingly, elevated levels of antibodies against Klebsiella and collagen fibers types I, III, IV, and V were detected in patients with CD and AS.\n- In addition to HLA-B27, other genes have been identified as being related to SpA and IBD. In fact, several common genetic predispositions between SpA and IBD were identified, of which the association with IL-23R polymorphisms is most prominent.\n- The functional role of IL-23 receptor polymorphisms remains unclear, the fact that IL-23 signaling plays a critical role in the Th17-mediated inflammation indicates that Th17 cells may represent a common pathogenetic mechanism in both IBD and SpA.\n- The first susceptibility gene that has been identified for CD is CARD15 (or NOD2). Variants within this gene increase the risk for CD by threefold for heterozygous and fortyfold for homozygous individuals.\n- An association was also found in SpA patients between the carriage of CARD15 variants and the development of chronic subclinical gut inflammation.\n- Although CARD15 mutations do not seem to predispose to arthritis, it might confer a risk towards the development of (sub) clinical gut inflammation in SpA patients, rendering these patients more disposed to develop IBD.\n\n【3】 - Recently, additionally shared associations between SpA and IBD were found at chromosome 1q32 near KIF21B (genome-wide significant), STAT3, IL-12B, CDKAL1, LRRK2/MUC19, and chromosome 13q14 (experiment-wise association).\n- As the genes IL-23R, STAT3, and IL-12B all influence Th17 lymphocyte differentiation/activation, this provides further evidence implicating the Th17 lymphocyte subset in the pathogenesis of SpA.\n- In addition to genetic susceptibility, an important role was also been given to the environmental factors in triggering the onset of disease.\n\n【4】 - Given the prototypical link between certain bacterial infections and the onset of reactive arthritis, several studies have aimed to assess the role of intestinal flora in disease progression, as well as the resulting changes in mucosal response.\n\n【5】 - This expression can activate innate immune cells (NK) to produce IL-22 that may help control inflammation at mucosal sites.\n\n【6】 - In the transition phase, acute intestinal and articular inflammation can be sustained due to defective immune regulation by TREG cells, or by ER stress, whereas iNKT cells act as regulators to control inflammation.

Absorption is rapid following single doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The presence of food and/or dairy products may decrease absorption. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3-4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.\nThere is no information on accumulation of norfloxacin with repeated administration in elderly patients. However, no dosage adjustment is required based on age alone. In elderly patients with reduced renal function, the dosage should be adjusted as for other patients with renal impairment .\nNorfloxacin is eliminated through metabolism, biliary excretion, and renal excretion. After a single 400-mg dose of NOROXIN, mean antimicrobial activities equivalent to 278, 773, and 82 μg of norfloxacin/g of feces were obtained at 12, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.

There are five types, with posterior and anterior dislocations being the most common:\n- Posterior – Result from a direct blow to the proximal tibia that displaces it posterior to the distal femur.\n- Anterior – Result from a hyperextension injury to the knee that tears the posterior structures and drives the distal femur posterior to the proximal tibia.\n- Medial – Result from valgus forces to the proximal tibia.\n- Rotatory – Result from indirect rotational forces, usually caused by the body rotating in the opposite direction of a planted foot. Rotatory dislocations are subdivided into anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral. Posterolateral dislocations are irreducible by closed reduction.\n\n【3】 #Complications\nPopliteal artery injury is the most dangerous potential complication following tibiofemoral dislocation. The popliteal artery is tethered across the popliteal space like a bowstring, making it susceptible to injury during knee dislocation. Up to 40 percent of patients with knee dislocations sustain an associated vascular injury. Of note, popliteal artery lesions or thrombosis may not become clinically apparent for up to several weeks following the acute knee injury.\nThe peroneal nerve winds around the fibular neck. It provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot and controls ankle dorsiflexion. The peroneal nerve is injured in up to 20 percent of patients with knee dislocations.\nOther potential short-term complications include compartment syndrome of the leg and deep vein thrombosis. Complications may also include pseudoaneurysm, instability, arthrosis, stiffness, and chronic pain. Associated fractures may occur, including injuries of the tibial plateau, tibial shaft, and the proximal fibula.\n\n【4】 #Clinical Features\nPain and swelling often limit the physical examination at the initial presentation, but the direction of the dislocation can often be assessed clinically. Often a significant hemarthrosis and ecchymosis are present in addition to the swelling. The circulation in the foot must be examined because the popliteal artery maybe injured or obstructed. Distal senstation and movement should be tested to exclude nerve injury.\nBe wary, the dislocation may spontaneously reduce but vascular injury may still occur in these cases.\n\n【5】 ## Knee X-ray\nAt least 2 views knee X-ray will assist in classifying the type of dislocation and reduction planning. In addition to the dislocation, the films occasionally reveal tibial spine fracture due to ligament avulsion. If vascular injury is suspected, attempted closed reduction should not be delayed awaiting imaging.\n\n【6】 ## CT Angiography\nIf there is any doubt about the circulation, such vascular studies are essential to detect and delineate any vascular injury.\n\n【7】 ## Contraindications and precautions\nPosterolateral dislocations are irreducible by closed reduction. Whenever this type is identified, the patient should be transferred to the operating room and an open reduction should be performed promptly.\n\n【8】 ## Analgesia and sedation\nProvide appropriate analgesia. Generally this means procedural sedation. If the clinical condition allows, general anesthesia may be contemplated because the muscle relaxation will ease the reduction especially in patients with delayed presentation where the soft tissue swelling and muscle spasm might hinder the reduction.\n\n【9】 ## Method of reduction\nClosed reduction of the dislocated knee should be performed immediately and must not be delayed if there is any sign of vascular impairment. Only patients with good peripheral pulses may undergo pre-reduction imaging.\nGenerally two clinicians are required to reduce the knee. The principle of traction and counter-traction is employed with vertical traction being sufficient most of the time and if unsuccessful, reverse mechanism of injury may be employed  i.e. vertical and medial force applied to the tibia in a lateral knee dislocation.\nFor isolated anterior or posterior dislocations, the knee should reduce easily with a satisfactory clunk. Special care should be taken to avoid applying any pressure at the popliteal fossa during reduction to avoid further injury to the popliteal artery.\nIf there is an open wound, or vascular damage which needs operation, the opportunity is taken to repair the capsule and ligaments. Otherwise, these structures are left undisturbed.\n\n【10】 ## Postreduction Management\n\n【11】 Meticulous evaluation of the extremity's circulatory status includes palpating the distal and popliteal pulses, measuring an ankle-brachial index (ABI), and performing a screening duplex ultrasound, if available. Obtain emergent bedside consultation by a vascular surgeon if the limb manifests ANY sign of vascular compromise. Such signs may include diminished or absent pulses, pale or dusky skin, paresthesias, and paralysis.\nOnce reduction is achieved the limb is arrested on a backslap with the knee bent in 15° of flexion. When swelling has subsided, a cast is applied and worn  for 12 Weeks. Thigh muscles exercises are practiced from the start. Weight-bearing in the plaster is permitted as soon as the patient can lift the leg. knee movement is regained once the plaster is removed.\nImaging - Obtain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs to confirm reduction\nIn either case, consult vascular surgery emergently should any arterial injury be identified. For patients without apparent vascular injury at the time of the initial evaluation, close surveillance, including daily vascular checks, must be performed for several days.\nAfter a thorough vascular assessment, magnetic resonance imaging  may be obtained to determine the extent of injury following knee dislocation.\n\n【12】 #Follow-up Care\nAfter postreduction radiographs are performed, the patient is admitted to the hospital overnight for close monitoring of the limb's vascular function. Serial reassessment of the neurovascular status is of the utmost importance, and exams should be performed every three to four hours for a minimum of 24 hour.\nOne-week interval XR may be performed to confirm reduction. Close Orthopedic follow-up is necessary to assess the extent of ligamentous injury and the need for surgical reconstruction.\nUpon discharge, patient should be educated about signs of vascular compromise and instructed to return to the ER if they experience any of the symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:22:34"}

The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 μM = 0.28 mcg/mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 μM against HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26 ± 0.18 μM against 8 clinical isolates. The EC50 values of abacavir against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.0015 to 1.05 μM, and against HIV-2 isolates, from 0.024 to 0.49 μM. Ribavirin (50 μM) had no effect on the anti–HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.\nLamivudine: The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines (including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes) using standard susceptibility assays. EC50 values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 μM (1 μM = 0.23 mcg/mL). HIV-1 from therapy-naive subjects with no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance gave median EC50 values of 0.429 µM (range: 0.200 to 2.007 µM) from Virco (n = 92 baseline samples from COLA40263) and 2.35 µM (1.37 to 3.68 µM) from Monogram Biosciences (n = 135 baseline samples from ESS30009). The EC50 values of lamivudine against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.120 µM, and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.003 to 0.120 μM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Ribavirin (50 μM) decreased the anti–HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5 fold in MT-4 cells.\nThe combination of abacavir and lamivudine has demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against non-subtype B isolates and HIV-2 isolates with equivalent antiviral activity as for subtype B isolates. Abacavir/lamivudine had additive to synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) emtricitabine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine; the protease inhibitors (PIs) amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir; or the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Ribavirin, used in combination with interferon for the treatment of HCV infection, decreased the anti-HIV-1 potency of abacavir/lamivudine reproducibly by 2- to 6-fold in cell culture.\n\n【2】 ## Resistance\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of abacavir and lamivudine have been selected in cell culture and have also been obtained from subjects failing abacavir/lamivudine-containing regimens. Genotypic characterization of abacavir/lamivudine-resistant viruses selected in cell culture identified amino acid substitutions M184V/I, K65R, L74V, and Y115F in HIV-1 RT.\nGenotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I in HIV-1 RT contributed to abacavir resistance. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from lamivudine-treated subjects showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid substitution in HIV-1 RT at codon 184 changing the methionine to either isoleucine or valine (M184V/I). In a trial of therapy-naive adults receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily (n = 384) or 300 mg twice daily (n = 386) in a background regimen of lamivudine 300 mg and efavirenz 600 mg once daily (CNA30021), the incidence of virologic failure at 48 weeks was similar between the 2 groups (11% in both arms). Genotypic (n = 38) and phenotypic analyses (n = 35) of virologic failure isolates from this trial showed that the RT substitutions that emerged during abacavir/lamivudine once-daily and twice-daily therapy were K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I. The abacavir- and lamivudine-associated resistance substitution M184V/I was the most commonly observed substitution in virologic failure isolates from subjects receiving abacavir/lamivudine once daily (56%, 10/18) and twice daily (40%, 8/20).\nThirty-nine percent (7/18) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a >2.5-fold decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range: 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5/17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range: 0.7 to 13). Fifty-six percent (10/18) of the virologic failure isolates in the once-daily abacavir group compared with 41% (7/17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily abacavir group had a >2.5-fold decrease in lamivudine susceptibility with median-fold changes of 81 (range 0.79 to >116) and 1.1 (range 0.68 to >116) in the once-daily and twice-daily abacavir arms, respectively.\n\n【3】 ## Cross-Resistance\nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Viruses containing abacavir and lamivudine resistance-associated amino acid substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, M184V, and Y115F, exhibit cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine in cell culture and in subjects.

In general, DORV is associated with concordant atrio-ventricular connection but it can occur with or without transposition of the great arteries. The clinical manifestations are similarly variable, depending on how the anatomical defects affect the physiology of the heart, in terms of altering the normal flow of blood from the RV and left ventricle (LV) to the aorta and pulmonary artery. For example:\n- in DORV with a subaortic VSD, blood from the LV flows through the VSD to the aorta and blood from the RV flows mainly to the pulmonary artery, yielding physiology similar to Tetralogy of Fallot but if there is pulmonic stenosis in addition, physiology resembles Tetralogy of Fallot\n- but again, if there is pulmonic stenosis, physiology resembles Tetralogy of Fallot\nWhile DORV is usually associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), it can also be associated with an atrial septal defect (ASD), anomaly of the coronary arteries, different grades of aortic stenosis or pulmonic artery stenosis.\nPathologist define the DORV when more than 50% of both great arteries arise from the right ventricle, but surgeons use the term when 90% of the arteries arise from the right ventricle.\n\n【3】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The Double Outlet of the Right Ventricle (DORV) accounts for 1-1.5% of all congenital heart diseases.\n- It has an incidence of 1 in 10.000 live births.\n- Generally, it is diagnosed during the first month of life, and there is no sex or race predilection.\n\n【4】 #Anatomy\nIn the DORV, the aorta and the pulmonary artery are related to the morphologic RV. There are three essential gross morphologic features that allow the many variants to be distinguished:\n\n【5】 ## The relationship of the great arteries to the ventricles\n- Aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary trunk (normal arrangement present in a 3% of the RVOT cases).\n- The great arteries side by side with the aorta to the right of the pulmonary trunk is the usual arrangement (approximately 64%)in double outlet RV. Physiologically similar to Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\n【6】 ## The relationship of the VSD to the great arteries\n- Provides the morphologic LV with its only outlet\n- Subaortic\n- Beneath both (doubly committed)\n\n【7】 ## The presence or absence of outflow obstruction to RV outflow\n- Pulmonic stenosis occurs in 41% to 72% of patients with double outlet RV\n- When pulmonic stenosis occurs, the VSD is almost always subaortic\n- RV blood is diverted into the aorta with a decrease in the oxygen saturation\nThe most common combination is the side-by-side relationship of the great arteries, with the aorta directly to the right and with the VSD in the subaortic location.\n- The LV blood selectively enters the aorta because of the proximity of the VSD to the aorta.\n- In the absence of pulmonic stenosis, the physiologic consequences are similar to those of an isolated VSD.\n- A low pulmonary vascular resistance PVR permits RV blood to flow almost exclusively into the pulmonary trunk and permits a substantial portion of the left ventricular blood to enter the pulmonary circulation.\n- Aortic O2 saturation is normal, and pulmonary artery (PA) blood flow is increased.\nThe Taussig-Bing anomaly involves the same great vessel relationship, but there is a subpulmonic VSD.\n- LV blood selectively enters the pulmonary trunk because of the proximity of the subpulmonic VSD to the pulmonary artery (PA).\n- Accounts for approximately 8% of cases.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\n- Most drugs affect the development of the cardiovascular system, because it appears earlier during the embryonic period.  Drugs such as busulfan, lithium, retinoids, thalidomide, and trimethadione can cause cardiac defects. Busulfan is an animal teratogen, and there are not definitive data that exposures have resulted in birth defects in humans. The other drugs are proven human teratogens, depending on the dose. The teratogenic risk of lithium is low and controversial.\n- Maternal use of alcohol during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with DORV.\n- Exposure to solvents during pregnancy.\n- A first-trimester febrile illness increases the risk by 40%–80%.\n- Fetal \"nutrition\" which is affected by maternal diet, uterine blood flow, placental function, and the fetal genome.\n\n【9】 The pathophysiology of the DORV is quite variable . It depends on the  great artery relationship (side by side, d-TGA, l-TGA, normally related arteries), the relationship of the VSD to the great arteries (subaortic or subpulmonary VSD), and on the presence or absence of RV outflow tract obstruction or pulmonary stenosis (PS).\nIn rare cases of DORV, there is a normal great artery relationship with the aorta arising posterior and to the right of the PA.\nClinical manifestations depends on the size, but mostly on the location of the VSD in relation to the great arteries. Also the clinical symptoms will depend on the presence or absence of a pulmonary stenosis.\nWhen the VSD is subaortic, the oxygenated blood is pump from the LV into the aorta, and deoxygenated blood flow from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery (closer to its location).\n\n【10】 #Genetics\nPatients with Noonan syndrome (autosomal dominant inheritance) may present with pulmonary stenosis, ASD, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Patients with Williams syndrome have the gene manifested in a variety of body organ systems such as the cardiovascular system (associated with pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis), the neurological system (mental retardation), and general manifestation such as short stature, hypercalcemia, caused by deletion at chromosome 7,\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe patients symptoms vary greatly depending on the severity of the defect, and associated defects. The patient may be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. Newborns may not immediately exhibit problems, and some children can wait a year or so before undergoing any type of repair.\nSymptoms include feeding difficulties and as a consequence poor weight gain, failure to thrive. Other sypmtoms include fatigue, difficulty breathing, and cyanosis. These symptoms are not specific for RVOT.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\nThe findings on physical examination vary significantly depending upon the presence and location of associated defects such as a VSD and pulmonic stenosis.\n\n【13】 ### Subaortic VSD present, pulmonic stenosis absent\n- Mild or absent cyanosis - Volume overload to the right side is associated with CHF.\n- Loud single S2\n- Hyperdynamic precordium\n\n【14】 ### Subaortic VSD and pulmonic stenosis both present\nThe major determinant of the findings is the severity of the pulmonic stenosis - Mild Pulmonic Stenosis: mild cyanosis and mild CHF may be present, and a systolic ejection murmur of pulmonic stenosis and / or the regurgitant murmur of the VSD\n- Moderate to Severe Pulmonic Stenosis: cyanosis is present\n\n【15】 ### Extremities\nCyanosis and clubbing may be present\n\n【16】 #Laboratory Findings\nDuring the initial diagnosis and management of children with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), routine laboratory studies are not required.\nIf polycythemia is suspected due to longstanding hypoxia, then a hemoglobin and hematocrit can be obtained.\n\n【17】 ## Electrolyte and Biomarker Studies\nMonitor serum electrolytes after treating children with diuretics, glycosides, and afterload-reducing agents.\n\n【18】 ## Electrocardiogram\nNormal sinus rhythm is generally present.  There are often associated conduction defects such as a prolonged PR interval, first degree AV block. P pulmonale is present in 75% of cases. As a result of pressure and volume overload, there are signs of RV hypertrophy and there is a right axis deviation.\nThere are a lot of ECG variations depending on the variety of DORV the presence of associated defects. If there is a subaortic VSD with no PS a superior QRS axis (-30° to -170°) may be present with either RVH or biventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. First-degree AV block may be present with this lesion. On the other hand, if there is subpulmonic VSD or in those with subaortic VSD and PS, then right axis deviation, RVH, and often right atrial enlargement may be present.\n\n【19】 ## Chest X Ray\nIf there is mild or no pulmonary stenosis, subpulmonary or subaortic VSD, cardiomegaly may be present due to increased pulmonary blood flow.  If transposition of the great arteries is present, the mediastinum may be narrow. These features are not specific for DORV.\nIf PS is present, chest radiography shows a normal heart size and normal-to-decreased pulmonary vascular markings.\n\n【20】 ## Echocardiography\nSee  also: Echo in Double Outlet Right Ventricle\n\n【21】 ## MRI and CT\nThese imaging modalities allow one to determine the visceral and atrial situs as vasculo-vascular and vasculo-visceral relationships.  MRI may aid in defining the spatial relationship between the VSD and the semilunar valves.\n\n【22】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\n- Evaluation of relationship of the great arteries and right ventricle\nPossible orientations: normal, side-by-side (aorta to the right of the pulmonary artery)\n- Doppler evaluation of pressure gradients and presence of valvular regurgitation\n- Associated anomalities, especially pulmonic stenosis but also:\nAtrial Septal Defect\nSubaortic Stenosis\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus\nMitral valvular abnormalities\n\n【23】 ### Special Echo techniques in DORV\n- Optimal views:\nParasternal long axis\nSubcostal coronal view\n- Parasternal short axis\nThe subxiphoid view allows to characterize the origin of both great vessels emerging from the RV, and also their relationship to one another.  In addition to the anatomy mentioned before it allows the  evaluation of the sub-pulmonic conus, the severity of the pulmonary stenosis and the relationship of the VSD to the aortic valve.\n\n【24】 ## Hemodynamic Studies\nCardiac catheterization is performed prior to complete repair, or prior to B-T shunt placement in cases of severe pulmonary stenosis.\n\n【25】 #Pathologic Findings\nImages shown below are Courtesy of Professor Peter Anderson DVM PhD and Published with permission.  PEIR, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Pathology\n\n【26】 ## Surgery and Device Based Therapy\nIf pulmonary stenosis is not present, double outlet right ventricle may be repaired in one operation. The surgeon will repair the VSD, but build a conduit through it to connect the left ventricle to the aorta. This technique is known as the Rastelli procedure. Other surgeons may opt for the arterial switch operation (or Jatene), commonly also used with transposition of the great arteries, in which the aorta is reconnected to the left ventricle\nThe surgical technique will depend upon the several factors: the location of the VSD and its relationship to the aortic and pulmonary valves, the presence or absence of pulmonary stenosis, and the distribution of the coronary arteries. There are also factors such as A-V discordance, size of the right ventricle, and the straddling of A-V valves.\n\n【27】 ### Palliative Surgery\nThis approach helps to improve the patient's clinical condition, allowing him or her to gain weight to achieve optimal conditions for definitive surgical repair.\n- Patients with no pulmonary stenosis + subpulmonary, subaortic, or doubly committed VSD with CHF  may undergo pulmonary artery banding to decrease pulmonary blood flow.\n\n【28】 ### Definitive Surgical Repair\nThe nature of the operation will depend on the relationship of VSD to the great arteries and the distribution of coronary arteries to determine surgical strategies.\nIf biventricular repair is not possible, a Fontan-type operation is an option with redirection of systemic (deoxygenated) blood into the pulmonary artery without compromising the ventricle. If the patients has a subpulmonary VSD, arterial switch operation with creation of an interventricular tunnel directing left ventricular outflow into the pulmonary artery, which becomes a neo-aorta due to the arterial switch. If the VSD is subaortic, a tunnel between the VSD and the aorta is made to direct oxygenated blood into systemic circulation and also to eliminate mixing of the 2 circulations. This operation is generally completed by age 4-6 months.\nMost medical centers have reported an approximated in-hospital mortality after surgery of 4.8% with a late mortality of 3.2%. The more complex the defect, the higher the mortality and the need for reoperation.\n\n【29】 List of contributors:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#25#25#Images shown below are Courtesy of Professor Peter...Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Pathology图片的提供者\n无关文本#29#29# List of contributors:", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 18:36:02"}

It is a result of the relative excess or lack of pigment within an iris or part of an iris, which may be genetically inherited or due to mosaicism,  or acquired by disease or injury.\nEye color, specifically the color of the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin pigment within the iris tissues.\nConsequently, anything affecting those factors may result in a difference of color being observed.\nThe affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic). An excess of pigmentation is usually associated with hyperplasia of the iris tissues whereas a lack of pigmentation is associated with hypoplasia. Although seen in humans, heterochromia in which one iris differs in color from the other iris is more frequently observed in non-human species such as cats (for example, Japanese Bobtails and Turkish Vans; white, shorthaired cats can be \"odd-eyed\" with one copper or orange eye and one blue eye, and the Turkish Angora), dogs (for example, Siberian Huskies as well as Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, and other breeds with merle coats), horses (so-called \"wall-eyed\" horses have one brown and one white or blue eye), and even water buffalo. Partial or sectoral heterochromia is much less common than complete heterochromia and is typically found in autosomally inherited disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease and Waardenburg syndrome. Famous comedian Dan Akroyd has this condition.\n\n【2】 #Classification based on etiology\nAlthough a distinction is frequently made between heterochromia that affects an eye completely or only partially, it is often classified as either genetic (due to mosaicism or congenital) or acquired, with mention as to whether the affected iris or portion of the iris is darker or lighter.\n\n【3】 ## Congenital heterochromia\nHeterochromia that is congenital is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\n- Lisch nodules - iris hamartomas seen in neurofibromatosis.\n- Ocular melanosis - a condition characterized by increased pigmentation of the uveal tract, episclera, and anterior chamber angle.\n- Oculodermal melanocytosis (nevus of Ota)\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome - a condition characterized by loss of pigmentation from the posterior iris surface which is disseminated intraocularly and deposited on various intraocular structures, including the anterior surface of the iris.\n- Simple heterochromia - a rare condition characterized by the absence of other ocular or systemic problems. The lighter eye is typically regarded as the affected eye as it usually shows iris hypoplasia. It may affect an iris completely or only partially.\n- Congenital Horner's syndrome - sometimes inherited, although usually acquired\n- Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Parry-Romberg syndrome\n\n【4】 ## Acquired heterochromia\nHeterochromia that is acquired is usually due to injury, inflammation, the use of certain eyedrops, or tumors.\n- Deposition of material\nSiderosis - iron deposition within ocular tissues due to a penetrating injury and a retained iron-containing, intraocular foreign body.\nHemosiderosis - long standing hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber) following blunt trauma to the eye may lead to iron deposition from blood products\n- Use of certain eyedrops - prostaglandin analogues (latanoprost, isopropyl unoprostone, travoprost, and bimatoprost) are used topically to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. A concentric heterochromia has developed in some patients applying these drugs. The stroma around the iris sphincter muscle becomes darker than the peripheral stroma. A stimulation of melanin synthesis within iris melanocytes has been postulated.\n- Neoplasm - Nevi and melanomatous tumors.\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis - a condition characterized by a low grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes hypochromic and has a washed-out, somewhat moth eaten appearance. The heterochromia can be very subtle, especially in patients with lighter colored irises. It is often most easily seen in daylight. The prevalence of heterochromia associated with Fuch's has been estimated in various studies with results suggesting that there is more difficulty recognizing iris color changes in dark-eyed individuals.\n- Acquired Horner's syndrome - usually acquired, as in neuroblastoma, although sometimes inherited.\n- Neoplasm - Melanomas can also be very lightly pigmented, and a lighter colored iris may be a rare manifestation of metastatic disease to the eye.\n- Chronic iritis - Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia and lymphoma\n\n【5】 ## Life Threatening Causes\n- Leukemia - Lymphoma - Neoplasm\n\n【6】 ## Common Causes\n- Acquired horner's syndrome\n- Chronic iritis - Congenital horner's syndrome\n- Duane syndrome\n- Eye hemorrhage\n- Eye injury\n- Foreign body in eye\n- Glaucoma - Hypoplasia - Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome\n- Rubeosis iridis - Uveitis\n\n【7】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n- Acquired horner's syndrome\n- Bimatoprost\n- Chromosome 8 trisomy syndrome\n- Chronic iritis - Congenital horner's syndrome\n- Duane syndrome\n- Eye hemorrhage\n- Eye injury\n- Foreign body in eye\n- Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis - Glaucoma - Hemosiderosis - Hirschsprung's disease\n- Hypoplasia - Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Inherited trait\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Isopropyl unoprostone\n- Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia - Lisch nodules\n- Lymphoma - Neoplasm\n- Neurofibromatosis - Ocular melanosis - Parry-romberg syndrome\n- Piebaldism\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome\n- Rubeosis iridis - Siderosis - Sturge-weber syndrome\n- Travoprost\n- Uveitis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:19:21"}

Depacon is also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.\nSimple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.\n\n【3】 ### Important Limitations\nBecause of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.\n\n【4】 ### Epilepsy\nDepacon is for intravenous use only.\nUse of Depacon for periods of more than 14 days has not been studied. Patients should be switched to oral valproate products as soon as it is clinically feasible.\nDepacon should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.\nIn one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of Depacon (up to 15 mg/kg and mean dose of 1184 mg) over 5-10 minutes (1.5-3.0 mg/kg/min). Patients generally tolerated the more rapid infusions well. This study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of these regimens.\n\n【5】 ### Initial Exposure to Valproate\nThe following dosage recommendations were obtained from studies utilizing oral divalproex sodium products.\nFor adults and children 10 years of age or older.\nMonotherapy (Initial Therapy)\nDepacon has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.\nThe probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.\nConversion to Monotherapy\nPatients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50-100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depacon therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.\nAdjunctive Therapy\nIn a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed . However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy.\nA good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations.\nAs the Depacon dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected.\nAntiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.\n\n【6】 ### Replacement Therapy\nWhen switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of Depacon should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product , and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen. There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving Depacon as replacement therapy. However, the equivalence shown between Depacon and oral valproate products (Depakote) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen. Whether, when Depacon is given less frequently (i.e. twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown. For this reason, when Depacon is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed.\n\n【7】 ### General Dosing Advice\nDue to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response.\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) . The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.\nRapid infusion of Depacon has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions. There is limited experience with infusion times of less than 60 minutes or rates of infusion > 20 mg/min in patients with epilepsy.\nDepacon should be administered intravenously as a 60 minute infusion, as noted above. It should be diluted with at least 50 mL of a compatible diluent. Any unused portion of the vial contents should be discarded.\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- Dextrose (5%) injection, USP\n- Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP\n- Lactated ringer's injection, USP\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Valproate sodium in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- status epilepticus\n\n【10】 ### Epilepsy\nDepacon is indicated as an intravenous alternative in patients for whom oral administration of valproate products is temporarily not feasible in the following conditions:\nDepacon is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures.

The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50-100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depacon therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.\nAdjunctive Therapy\nIn a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed . However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy.\nA good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations.\nAs the Depacon dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected.\nAntiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.\n\n【14】 ### Replacement Therapy\nWhen switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of Depacon should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product , and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen. There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving Depacon as replacement therapy. However, the equivalence shown between Depacon and oral valproate products (Depakote) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen. Whether, when Depacon is given less frequently (i.e. twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown. For this reason, when Depacon is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed.\n\n【15】 ### General Dosing Advice\nDue to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response.\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) . The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.\nRapid infusion of Depacon has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions. There is limited experience with infusion times of less than 60 minutes or rates of infusion > 20 mg/min in patients with epilepsy.\nDepacon should be administered intravenously as a 60 minute infusion, as noted above. It should be diluted with at least 50 mL of a compatible diluent. Any unused portion of the vial contents should be discarded.\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- Dextrose (5%) injection, USP\n- Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP\n- Lactated ringer's injection, USP\n\n【16】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Valproate sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- status epilepticus\n- West syndrome\n- 40 to 100 mg/kg/day\n\n【18】 #Contraindications\n- Depacon should not be administered to patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.\n- Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g. Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children under two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.\n\n【19】 ### General Information on Hepatotoxicity\nHepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, physicians should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.\nCaution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, “Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.”\nExperience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When Depacon is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Use of Depacon has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.\n\n【20】 ### Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease\nDepacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder . Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG) (e.g. Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes. Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents.\nPOLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, opthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura. POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders. The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.\nIn patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depacon should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depacon for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring.\nThe drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug .\n\n【21】 ## Birth Defects\nValproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g. craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.\n\n【22】 ## Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure\nValproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6  than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine , carbamazepine , and phenytoin . It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.\nIn animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits.\nWomen with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks.\n\n【23】 ## Use in Women of Childbearing Potential\nBecause of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g. migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.\nTo prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.\nEvidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.\n\n【24】 ## Pancreatitis\nCases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044 patient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.\n\n【25】 ## Urea Cycle Disorders\nValproate sodium is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).\nHyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of valproate therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1 those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2 those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3 those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4 those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders.\n\n【26】 ## Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders\nValproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets ≤ 75 x 109/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.\nBecause of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters (e.g. low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand’s disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving Depacon be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.\n\n【27】 ## Hyperammonemia\nHyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders.\nAsymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.\n\n【28】 ## Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use\nConcomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.\n\n【29】 ## Hypothermia\nHypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.\n\n【30】 ## Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\n\n【31】 ## Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics\nCarbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates.\n\n【32】 ## Somnolence in the Elderly\nIn a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence.\n\n【33】 ## Post-traumatic seizures\nA study was conducted to evaluate the effect of IV valproate in the prevention of post-traumatic seizures in patients with acute head injuries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IV valproate given for one week (followed by oral valproate products for either one or six months per random treatment assignment) or IV phenytoin given for one week (followed by placebo). In this study, the incidence of death was found to be higher in the two groups assigned to valproate treatment compared to the rate in those assigned to the IV phenytoin treatment group (13% vs. 8.5%, respectively). Many of these patients were critically ill with multiple and/or severe injuries, and evaluation of the causes of death did not suggest any specific drug-related causation. Further, in the absence of a concurrent placebo control during the initial week of intravenous therapy, it is impossible to determine if the mortality rate in the patients treated with valproate was greater or less than that expected in a similar group not treated with valproate, or whether the rate seen in the IV phenytoin treated patients was lower than would be expected. Nonetheless, until further information is available, it seems prudent not to use Depacon in patients with acute head trauma for the prophylaxis of post-traumatic seizures.\n\n【34】 ## Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration\nSince valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy.\n\n【35】 ## Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests\nValproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.\nThere have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown.\n\n【36】 ## Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication\nThere are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known. Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.\n\n【37】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThe following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:\n- Hepatic failure\n- Birth defects\n- Decreased IQ following in utero exposure\n- Pancreatitis - Hyperammonemic encephalopathy\n- Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders\n- Hypothermia - Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions\n- Somnolence in the elderly\nBecause clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe adverse reactions that can result from Depacon use include all of those associated with oral forms of valproate. The following describes experience specifically with Depacon. Depacon has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials involving 111 healthy adult male volunteers and 352 patients with epilepsy, given at doses of 125 to 6,000 mg (total daily dose). A total of 2% of patients discontinued treatment with Depacon due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were 2 cases each of nausea/vomiting and elevated amylase. Other adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were hallucinations, pneumonia, headache, injection site reaction, and abnormal gait. Dizziness and injection site pain were observed more frequently at a 100 mg/min infusion rate than at rates up to 33 mg/min. At a 200 mg/min rate, dizziness and taste perversion occurred more frequently than at a 100 mg/min rate. The maximum rate of infusion studied was 200 mg/min.\nAdverse reactions reported by at least 0\nIn a separate clinical safety trial, 112 patients with epilepsy were given infusions of Depacon (up to 15 mg/kg) over 5 to 10 minutes (1.5-3.0 mg/kg/min). The common adverse reactions (> 2%) were somnolence (10.7%), dizziness (7.1%), paresthesia (7.1%), asthenia (7.1%), nausea (6.3%), and headache (2.7%)g. somnolence (1.7%), dizziness (5.2%), paresthesia (0.9%), asthenia (0%), nausea (3.2%), and headache (4.3%), a direct comparison between the incidence of adverse reactions in the 2 cohorts cannot be made because of differences in patient populations and study designs.\nAmmonia levels have not been systematically studied after IV valproate, so that an estimate of the incidence of hyperammonemia after IV Depacon cannot be provided. Hyperammonemia with encephalopathy has been reported in 2 patients after infusions of Depacon.\n\n【38】 ## Epilepsy\nBased on a placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures, Depakote (divalproex sodium) was generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Intolerance was the primary reason for discontinuation in the Depakote-treated patients (6%), compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients.\nSince patients were also treated with other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of Depakote and other antiepilepsy drugs.\nThe following additional adverse reactions were reported by greater than 1% but less than 5% of the 358 patients treated with valproate in the controlled trials of complex partial seizures:\n- Body as a Whole: Back pain, chest pain, malaise.\n- Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypertension, palpitation.\n- Digestive System: Increased appetite, flatulence, hematemesis, eructation, pancreatitis, periodontal abscess.\n- Hemic and Lymphatic System: Petechia.\n- Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: SGOT increased, SGPT increased.\n- Musculoskeletal System: Myalgia, twitching, arthralgia, leg cramps, myasthenia.\n- Nervous System: Anxiety, confusion, abnormal gait, paresthesia, hypertonia, incoordination, abnormal dreams, personality disorder.\n- Respiratory System: Sinusitis, cough increased, pneumonia, epistaxis.\n- Skin and Appendages: Rash, pruritus, dry skin.\n- Special Senses: Taste perversion, abnormal vision, deafness, otitis media.\n- Urogenital System: Urinary incontinence, vaginitis, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, urinary frequency.\n\n【39】 ## Mania\nAlthough Depacon has not been evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, the following adverse reactions not listed above were reported by 1% or more of patients from two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Depakote (Divalproex Sodium) tablets.\n- Body as a Whole: Chills, neck pain, neck rigidity.\n- Cardiovascular System: Hypotension, postural hypotension, vasodilation.\n- Digestive System: Fecal incontinence, gastroenteritis, glossitis.\n- Musculoskeletal System: Arthrosis.\n- Nervous System: Agitation, catatonic reaction, hypokinesia, reflexes increased, tardive dyskinesia, vertigo.\n- Skin and Appendages: Furunculosis, maculopapular rash, seborrhea.\n- Special Senses: Conjunctivitis, dry eyes, eye pain.\n- Urogenital: Dysuria.\n\n【40】 ## Migraine\nAlthough Depacon has not been evaluated for safety and efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches, the following adverse reactions not listed above were reported by 1% or more of patients from two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Depakote (Divalproex Sodium) tablets.\n- Body as a Whole: Face edema.\n- Digestive System: Dry mouth, stomatitis.\n- Urogenital System: Cystitis, metrorrhagia, and vaginal hemorrhage.\n\n【41】 ## Post-Marketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Depakote. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Dermatologic: Photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n- Neurologic: There have been several reports of acute or subacute cognitive decline and behavioral changes (apathy or irritability) with cerebral pseudoatrophy on imaging associated with valproate therapy; both the cognitive/behavioral changes and cerebral pseudoatrophy reversed partially or fully after valproate discontinuation.\n- Psychiatric: Emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, psychomotor hyperactivity, hostility, disturbance in attention, learning disorder, and behavioral deterioration.\n- Musculoskeletal: Fractures, decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and weakness.\n- Hematologic: Relative lymphocytosis, macrocytosis, leucopenia, anemia including macrocytic with or without folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and acute intermittent porphyria.\n- Endocrine: Irregular menses, secondary amenorrhea, breast enlargement, galactorrhea, parotid gland swelling, polycystic ovary disease, decreased carnitine concentrations, hyponatremia, hyperglycinemia, and inappropriate  secretion.\nThere have been rare reports of Fanconi's syndrome occurring chiefly in children.\n- Genitourinary: Enuresis and urinary tract infection.\n- Special Senses: Hearing loss.\n- Other: Allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, developmental delay, bone pain, bradycardia, and cutaneous vasculitis.\n\n【42】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Valproate sodium Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance\nDrugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.\nIn contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g. antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.\nBecause of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.\nDrugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed\n\n【44】 ### Aspirin\nA study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The β-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.\n\n【45】 ### Carbapenem Antibiotics\nA clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates.\n\n【46】 ### Felbamate\nA study involving the co-administration of 1200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.\n\n【47】 ### Rifampin\nA study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\n\n【48】 ### Antacids\nA study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate.\n\n【49】 ### Chlorpromazine\nA study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.\n\n【50】 ### Haloperidol\nA study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels.\n\n【51】 ### Cimetidine and Ranitidine\nCimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate.\n\n【52】 ## Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs\nValproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronyl transferases.\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.\nDrugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed\n\n【53】 ### Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline\nAdministration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.\n\n【54】 ### Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide\nSerum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.\n\n【55】 ### Clonazepam\nThe concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.\n\n【56】 ### Diazepam\nValproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Co-administration of valproate . Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.\n\n【57】 ### Ethosuximide\nValproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.\n\n【58】 ### Lamotrigine\nIn a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration\n\n【59】 ### Phenobarbital\nValproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.\nThere is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.\nPrimidone which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.\n\n【60】 ### Phenytoin\nValproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.\nIn patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation.\n\n【61】 ### Tolbutamide\nFrom in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown.\n\n【62】 ### Warfarin\nIn an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%. The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.\n\n【63】 ### Zidovudine\nIn six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\n\n【64】 ### Acetaminophen\nValproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was concurrently administered to three epileptic patients.\n\n【65】 ### Clozapine\nIn psychotic patients (n = 11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with clozapine.\n\n【66】 ### Lithium\nCo-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n = 16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium.\n\n【67】 ### Lorazepam\nConcomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.\n\n【68】 ### Olanzapine\nNo dose adjustment for olanzapine is necessary when olanzapine is administered concomitantly with valproate. Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.\n\n【69】 ### Oral Contraceptive Steroids\nAdministration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 µg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.\n\n【70】 ### Topiramate\nConcomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy. Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported.\n\n【71】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n\n【72】 ## Pregnancy Registry\nTo collect information on the effects of in utero exposure to Depacon, physicians should encourage pregnant patients taking Depacon to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. Information on the registry can be found at the website, /.\n\n【73】 ### Fetal Risk Summary\nAll pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects (about 3%), pregnancy loss (about 15%), or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g. craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies.\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero.\nAn observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval : 1.7-4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Because the study was observational in nature, conclusions regarding a causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder cannot be considered definitive.\nIn animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits.\n\n【74】 ### Clinical Considerations\n- Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal valproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally estimated as 1-2%, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to 7 in 10,000 births).\n- Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers were treated with valproate during pregnancy.\n- Because of the risks of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other fetal adverse events, which may occur very early in pregnancy:\n- Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks. When treating a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential, carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment and provide appropriate counseling.\n- Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate.\n- Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy.\n- Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy.\n\n【75】 ### Human\nThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDC’s National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07%. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been estimated to be approximately 1 to 2%.\nThe NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation rate of 9-11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show up to a five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other antiepileptic drugs taken in monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g. oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g. clubfoot, polydactyly), and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems.\nPublished epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6  than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine , carbamazepine  and phenytoin . It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on cognitive development.\nThere are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy.\n\n【76】 ### Animal\nIn developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Valproate sodium in women who are pregnant.\n\n【77】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Valproate sodium during labor and delivery.\n\n【78】 ### Nursing Mothers\nValproate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when valproate is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【79】 ### Pediatric Use\nExperience with oral valproate has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions . The safety of Depacon has not been studied in individuals below the age of 2 years. If a decision is made to use Depacon in this age group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.\nYounger children, especially those receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations.\nThe variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.\nPediatric Clinical Trials\nNo unique safety concerns were identified in the 35 patients age 2 to 17 years who received Depacon in clinical trials.\nOne twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of Depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years). The safety and tolerability of Depakote in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults .\nJuvenile Animal Toxicology\nIn studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis.\n\n【80】 ### Geriatic Use\nNo patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.\nA study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence . The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence .\nNo unique safety concerns were identified in the 21 patients > 65 years of age receiving Depacon in clinical trials.\n\n【81】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Valproate sodium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【82】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Valproate sodium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【83】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Valproate sodium in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【84】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Valproate sodium in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【85】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Valproate sodium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【86】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Valproate sodium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【87】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【88】 ### Monitoring\nSince valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy.\n\n【89】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Valproate sodium and IV administrations.\n\n【90】 #Overdosage\nOverdosage with valproate may result in somnolence, heart block, and deep coma. Fatalities have been reported; however patients have recovered from valproate serum concentrations as high as 2120 mcg/mL.\nIn overdose situations, the fraction of drug not bound to protein is high and hemodialysis or tandem hemodialysis plus hemoperfusion may result in significant removal of drug. General supportive measures should be applied with particular attention to the maintenance of adequate urinary output.\nNaloxone has been reported to reverse the CNS depressant effects of valproate overdosage. Because naloxone could theoretically also reverse the antiepilepsy effects of valproate, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.\n\n【91】 ## Mechanism of Action\nDepacon exists as the valproate ion in the blood. The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n\n【92】 ## Structure\nDepacon (valproate sodium) is the sodium salt of valproic acid designated as sodium 2-propylpentanoate. Valproate sodium has the following structure:\nChemical Structure of valproate sodium\nValproate sodium has a molecular weight of 166.2. It occurs as an essentially white and odorless, crystalline, deliquescent powder.\nDepacon solution is available in 5 mL single-dose vials for intravenous injection. Each mL contains valproate sodium equivalent to 100 mg valproic acid, edetate disodium 0.40 mg, and water for injection to volume. The pH is adjusted to 7.6 with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. The solution is clear and colorless.\n\n【93】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThe relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.\nFor example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.\n\n【94】 ### Epilepsy\nThe therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.\nEquivalent doses of Depacon and Depakote (divalproex sodium) yield equivalent plasma levels of the valproate ion.\n\n【95】 ### Bioavailability\nEquivalent doses of intravenous (IV) valproate and oral valproate products are expected to result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to the valproate ion when the IV valproate is administered as a 60 minute infusion. However, the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation used. These differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.\nAdministration of Depakote (divalproex sodium) tablets and IV valproate (given as a one hour infusion), 250 mg every 6 hours for 4 days to 18 healthy male volunteers resulted in equivalent AUC, Cmax, Cmin at steady state, as well as after the first dose. The Tmax after IV Depacon occurs at the end of the one hour infusion, while the Tmax after oral dosing with Depakote occurs at approximately 4 hours. Because the kinetics of unbound valproate are linear, bioequivalence between Depacon and Depakote up to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/kg/day can be assumed. The AUC and Cmax resulting from administration of IV valproate 500 mg as a single one hour infusion and a single 500 mg dose of Depakene syrup to 17 healthy male volunteers were also equivalent.\nPatients maintained on valproic acid doses of 750 mg to 4250 mg daily (given in divided doses every 6 hours) as oral Depakote (divalproex sodium) alone (n = 24) or with another stabilized antiepileptic drug , showed comparable plasma levels for valproic acid when switching from oral Depakote to IV valproate (1-hour infusion).\nEleven healthy volunteers were given single infusions of 1000 mg IV valproate over 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes in a 4-period crossover study. Total valproate concentrations were measured; unbound concentrations were not measured. After the 5 minute infusions (mean rate of 2.8 mg/kg/min), mean Cmax was 145 ± 32 mcg/mL, while after the 60 minute infusions, mean Cmax was 115 ± 8 mcg/mL. Ninety to 120 minutes after infusion initiation, total valproate concentrations were similar for all 4 rates of infusion. Because protein binding is nonlinear at higher total valproate concentrations, the corresponding increase in unbound Cmax at faster infusion rates will be greater.\n\n【96】 ### Distribution\n- Protein Binding\nThe plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g. aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).\n\n【97】 ### CNS Distribution\n- Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).\n\n【98】 ### Metabolism\nValproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30-50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15-20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.\nThe relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear.\n\n【99】 ## Elimination\nMean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2 and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively. Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy after an intravenous infusion of 1,000 mg was 16 ± 3.0 hours.\nThe estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.\n- Special Populations\n- Effect of Age\n- Neonates\nChildren within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months.\n- Children\nPediatric patients (i.e. between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e. mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.\n- Elderly\n\n【100】 ### Effect of Sex\nThere are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8 ± 0.17 and 4.7 ± 0.07 L/hr per 1.73 m2, respectively).\n\n【101】 ### Effect of Race\nThe effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied.\n\n【102】 ### Effect of Disease\n- Liver Disease\nLiver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate. In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50% in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16% in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects. In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal.\nA slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.\n\n【103】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenesis\nValproate was administered orally to rats and mice at doses of 80 and 170 mg/kg/day (less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis) for two years. The primary findings were an increase in the incidence of subcutaneous fibrosarcomas in high-dose male rats receiving valproate and a dose-related trend for benign pulmonary adenomas in male mice receiving valproate\n- Mutagenesis - Fertility\nChronic toxicity studies of valproate in juvenile and adult rats and dogs demonstrated reduced spermatogenesis and testicular atrophy at oral doses of 400 mg/kg/day or greater in rats (approximately equivalent to or greater than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis) and 150 mg/kg/day or greater in dogs (approximately 1.4 times the MRHD or greater on a mg/m2 basis). Fertility studies in rats have shown no effect on fertility at oral doses of valproate up to 350 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD dose on a mg/m2 basis) for 60 days. The effect of valproate on testicular development and on sperm production and fertility in humans is unknown.\n\n【104】 #Clinical Studies\n\n【105】 ### Epilepsy\nThe efficacy of valproate in reducing the incidence of complex partial seizures (CPS) that occur in isolation or in association with other seizure types was established in two controlled trials.\nIn one, multiclinic, placebo controlled study employing an add-on design (adjunctive therapy), 144 patients who continued to suffer eight or more CPS per 8 weeks during an 8 week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin sufficient to assure plasma concentrations within the \"therapeutic range\" were randomized to receive, in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug (AED), either Depakote or placebo. Randomized patients were to be followed for a total of 16 weeks\nA positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e. a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo For example, 45% of patients treated with valproate had a ≥ 50% reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23% of patients treated with placebo.\nThe second study assessed the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1 they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2 they made a successful transition over a two week interval to valproate. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to Depakote monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively.\n\n【106】 #How Supplied\n\n【107】 ## Storage\nRecommended storage: Store vials at controlled room temperature 15-30°C (59-86°F). No preservatives have been added.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PAINT AND ALLIED COATING PRODUCTS\nThe handling of raw materials and finished products; dispersion of pigment or resin particles; thinning, tinting, and shading; filling; and laboratory functions are some of the operations in the paint and allied coatings industry that will be discussed in this publication. The recommendations are broad-based to accommodate variations between facilities and the wide range of operations and processes encountered. Many of the recommendations, such as those addressing the use of personal protective equipment, machine guarding, container labeling, and worker training, are consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) General Industry Standards contained in 29 CFR 1910. Other recommendations, such as those concerning substitution of raw materials, engineering controls, or safe lifting techniques are addressed only generally in OSHA standards or not at all.\nThe recommendations are intended to enable management and labor to develop better work practices and training programs that will result in safer working environments.\nThe document in its entirety provides safety and health information for organized labor; managers, technical consultants, and occupational safety and health personnel of companies involved in this industry; and the field staffs of various governmental agencies (i.e. NIOSH, OSHA, and EPA) responsible for the safety and health of workers.\n\n【2】 #II.

Overview\nPaint and allied coating products constitute a general class of materials whose primary functions are the protection and decoration of surfaces. Coatings are also used for fire retardation, color coding, electrical insulation, and temperature control ,\nIn the most narrow sense, \"paint\" refers only to pigmented products such as interior (wall), exterior (house), masonry, and traffic coatings; terms for other coatings include enamel, undercoater, primer, sealer, varnish, lacquer, stain, and industrial finishes. Historically, however, the term \"paint\" has sufficed as the common description for coating materials consisting of a covering material (pigment), a film-forming material (usually an oil or resin), and viscosity modifiers (thinners and solvents).\nThe terms \"organic surface coating,\" \"paint and coating,\" or \"chemical coating\" are increasingly being used to describe a variety of products that are used for the protection or decoration of surfaces.\nRelated to the various types of surface coatings are allied products such as putties and paint and varnish removers.\n\n【3】 #Thousands of different raw materials  are used in the manufacture of approximately 20,000 different coating products .\nThe need for so many raw materials and products results from the great diversity of surfaces requiring treatment. There are numerous small manufacturers because paint-making is still largely a batch process that does not readily lend itself to automation or continuous flow processing , Few firms sell nationwide because of high shipping costs, the difficulty of maintaining production schedules, and other distribution problems.\n\n【4】 #I. Industry Trends\nGrowth in the total production of the U.S. paint and allied coating products industry has been about 2% annually since 1967 and is expected to continue at this rate through 1990 .\nIn 1981, over 900 companies produced architectural coatings, approximately 250 companies made product coatings for original equipment manufacturers, and approximately 250 companies made special purpose coatings .\nThe largest companies are active in all coatings categories; whereas, the smaller companies may specialize in only one segment of the industry .\n\n【5】 #Air pollution regulations limiting\nthe amount of volatile organic compounds that can be used in coatings and the rapid rise in solvent prices are responsible for the trend in the coatings industry to replace conventional low-solids, volatile organic solvent-based coatings with high-solids (i.e. over 70%) or low solvent or water-based formulations such as radiation-curable coatings, powder coatings, two-part catalyzed systems, and nonaqueous dispersions ,1,2,6 In addition to the air pollution emission potential of various coating systems, a factor in their selection is the amount of energy required for application and for engineering controls to reduce occupational exposure.\nBecause of relatively high energy efficiencies, the use of high-solids and radiation-curable coatings is expected to increase ,\n\n【6】 #E x t e n t of E x p o s u r e\nAccording to the 1978 Annual Survey of Manufacturers , the paint and allied coating products industry in the United States employed about 61,500 workers in 1,700 individual plants. About 60% of the paint facilities had fewer than 20 workers, and only about 3% of the facilities (i.e. about 50) had more than 250 workers . These coatings include paints, lacquers, and powders and are applied during the manufacturing process to the surfaces of products made from metal, wood, or plastic. About 60-65% of these coatings have been solvent-based, but in recent years applications for water-based, high-solids, powder coatings, and two-part catalyzed systems have been increasing , \"Special purpose coatings\" may be stock-type or shelf goods, but they are formulated specifically for refinishing and specialty applications or for environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures or corrosivechemical atmospheres .\nThese coating types include high-performance industrial maintenance paints, automotive and machinery refinishes, and traffic paints and can be either solvent-or water-based ,\n\n【7】 #J o b C l a s s i f i c a t i o n s\nA scheme for the classification and description of jobs in this industry has been developed by Discher et al,\n\n【8】 In many smaller plants, one worker might perform a number of different jobs rather than just one particular task.\n\n【9】 #Raw materials handlers\nTransport and store raw materials in the plant.\n\n【10】 #Prebatch assemblers\nWeigh and assemble raw materials (usually dry) for the mixer, primarily in the raw materials storage and mixing areas.\n\n【11】 #Mixers (including mill operators)\nLoad mixing tanks or mills.

Raw Materials\nLiquid paint is a suspension of pigment particles in a mixture of film-former and volatile solvent.\nThe solvent, which reduces viscosity to allow easy application, and the film-former hold the pigment in the dried film and cause it to adhere to the coated surface.\nThe pigment confers hiding and coloring power as well as durability to the dried film.\nVarious additives are used to obtain particular characteristics.\nAlthough drying is usually accomplished through evaporation of the solvent, drying may also be by polymerization of the film-former through oxidation (e.g. with oils and alkyds), by coalescence (e.g. with latexes), or by chemical reactivity (e.g. with epoxy resins) .\nIn 1980, an estimated 9.5 billion pounds of raw materials (excluding water) were used in the manufacture of paint and allied coating products ,\n\n【23】 #F I G U R E II-2. R A W M A T E R I A L S U S E D IN T H E M A N U F A C T U R E OF C O A T I N G\nNatural resin film-formers constituted less than 1% of all film-formers consumed in 1977 , in contrast to about 50% prior to World War II , Some of these natural resins include rosins and shellac.\n\n【24】 #Pigments\nPigments are incorporated into coatings to impart color, opacity, and properties such as durability, corrosion inhibition, and mildew control or to be a filler or extender . They are finely powdered solids that are essentially insoluble in the medium in which they are dispersed. Almost all of the pigments utilized in the U.S. (99%) are inorganic  with titanium dioxide accounting for about one-third of total pigments used . Pigments are generally classified as white (opaque) pigments, colored and black pigments, extenders (non-opaque), and miscellaneous (mainly metallic powders).  They are less expensive than many other types of organic solvents and have many uses.\nAn organic solvent-based coating material that contains no hydrocarbon solvent is unusual. Hydrocarbon solvents used in the paint industry are classified as either aliphatic naphthas or aromatics.\nAliphatic naphtha solvents such as mineral spirits or Varnish Makers' and Painters'  naphtha are predominantly paraffins, with a smaller but appreciable content of cycloparaffins (naphthenes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane). These solvents may also contain as much as 20-30% aromatics ,\nMineral spirits constitute about three-fourths of all hydrocarbon solvents used in the paint and allied coating products industry overall.\nThe aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, xylene, high flash solvent naphthas, and aromatic naphthas predominantly exhibit higher solvency than aliphatic solvents.\n\n【25】 #b. Oxygenated Solvents\nOxygenated solvents are so designated because of the presence of oxygen which contributes polarity (a difference in the electric charge on various portions of the materials).\nThis polarity is the fundamental difference between oxygenated and hydrocarbon solvents, which are essentially nonpolar.\nBecause\n\n【26】 #A d d i t i v e s\nMany substances that contribute to the ease of manufacture, the stability of the paint in the package, the ease of application, or the quality or appearance of the applied film are used in relatively small quantities in paint formulations.\nThese\n\n【27】 #e. A n t i -s k i n n i n g A g e n t s\nSkinning refers to the drying of a coating, but at the wrong time and in the wrong place (e.g. while it is still packaged).\nOxidative polymerization of the film-formers at the air-liquid interface can lead to the formation of a solid or gelatinous skin on the surface.  reactions. Production is begun by mixing the pigment, film-former, and solvent (organic solvent or water). This is followed by the dispersion operation, which is a manipulation of the mixture to achieve pigment particle separation, wetting, and stabilization.\nThe performance of the finished product depends on the maintenance of uniform interparticle distances in the dried film .\nA variety of equipment is used to effect dispersion.\nThe trend currently is to use equipment in which the paint formulation can be continuously mixed and dispersed, followed by thinning in the same unit , After dispersion, the resultant material is tested for viscosity, color, and other physical properties while being adjusted or thinned.\nAfter passing this inspection, the batch is strained and loaded into containers.\nVarnishes are classified on the basis of the resins used.\nOleoresinous varnishes are solutions of both oils and resins; whereas, spirit varnishes such as shellac are formed by dissolving a resin in a solvent.\nVarnish manufacture essentially consists of heating or cooking materials in a reactor vessel or kettle and then thinning and filtering the final product , 1. Paints a. Materials Handling Materials handling occurs primarily at both ends of the production process.\nRaw materials are available as liquids, solids, powders, pastes, and slurries.\n\n【28】 #b. Dispersion\nThe assembly of raw materials is followed by the mixing of pigments with film-formers, solvents, and additives and the dispersion of the pigment particles in the liquid matrix.\nDispersion consists of a deagglomeration or separation of aggregates of individual particles, the wetting of particles with solvent and film-former, and uniformly distributing particles in the liquid phase.\nTypes of dispersion equipment include high-speed shaft-impeHer dispersers, dough mixers, and a variety of mills such as roller, stone, pebble, media, stator-rotor, attritor, Uniroll, resonant, vibratory, and Kady .\nAfter the dispersion operation, it may be necessary to clean the mills and tanks before a new batch is introduced.\nTank and mill cleaning can involve hand and power tools as well as caustic cleaners and solvents. c. T h i n n i n g , T i n t i n g , a n d S h a d i n g Thinning operations involve the further addition of a film-former or solvent to the batch following the mixing and dispersion operations. These operations may be performed in stationary tanks or in portable change cans. Tinting and shading operations involve adding color to white bases or adjusting the color of solid color bases that have been formulated as complete products.\n\n【29】 #d. Filling Operations and Finished Product Handling\nAfter the desired paint quality is achieved, the paint is strained or filtered to remove foreign material.\nFabric or metal screen filters, vibrating or variable-speed centrifugal clarifiers, vibrating screens, and cartridge filters can be used.\n\n【30】 #Lacquers\nLacquers differ from most other coatings in that the film dries or hardens entirely by evaporation. Therefore, it is impractical to manufacture lacquers in the customary manner because volatilization of the solvents results in deposits of a dry, solid film on processing equipment .\nThus, production is carried out in enclosed equipment such as tanks or mixers to reduce solvent loss, ensure ease of cleanup, and provide fire safety.\nHowever, lacquer is produced in the same general manner as paint.\n\n【31】 #Varnishes\nAll varnishes (i.e. oleoresinous and spirit) are solutions of film-formers in organic solvents. The manufacture of oleoresinous varnishes involves a cooking stage to render the oil and resin more compatible, to develop high molecular weight molecules or polymers, and to obtain solubility in the thinner or solvent. The manufacture of spirit varnishes usually involves cold cutting the resin with the solvent; however, mild heat may be used occasionally , Varnish is cooked in portable kettles or in large reactors, although kettles are now used only to a limited extent and primarily by smaller manufacturers .\nLarge closed reactors with capacities of 1,000 to 8,000 gallons are more common .\n\n【32】 #a. Operation of Kettles\nIn facilities where portable kettles are still used, resin and oil or resin alone is added to the kettle and then heated to about 600°F (316°C).\nNatural resins must be heated prior to adding the oils to make the resin more compatible with the oils.\nAll materials are poured in over the top of the kettle (150-375 gallon capacity). During the cooking phase, the kettles are covered with retractable hoods with exhaust pipes that may be fitted with solvent condensers. After the materials are cooked, the kettles are moved to rooms where the kettles are cooled quickly, often by water spray, and thinner and driers are added .\n\n【33】 #b. Operation of Reactor Vessels\nVarnish production is different when reactor vessels are used instead of kettles.\nMost reactors range in size from 500 to 8,000 gallons . Reactors are designed to give exact process control and usually can handle a variety of different varnishes, operate over a wide range of temperatures, and be cleaned easily.\nThe vessels are fitted with agitators, manholes, sight-glasses, lines to charge liquid reactants, condensers, temperature measuring devices, sampling devices, discharge lines, and heat sources.\n\n【34】 #c. Filtering\nFiltration of the thinned resin is the final step before the varnish is packaged. This is normally done while the resin is still hot. The filter press is the most commonly used filtering device .\n\n【35】 #Powder Coatings\nPowder coatings are solventless systems based on the melting and subsequent fusion of resin and other additive particles onto surfaces of heated objects.\n\n【36】 #Three methods have been used\nto manufacture powder coatings: dry blending, extrusion melt-mixing, and a combination of the two. Dry blending of powder coating ingredients is usually accomplished by placing all components (powdered resin, pigments, additives, and powdered curing agents) into a cooled pebble mill with high density porcelain grinding media.\nThe extrusion melt-mixing method involves premixing the dry components to ensure homogeneity and to reduce particle size.\nThe mix is placed in a specially-designed extruder where it is heated until molten.\nThe molten material is then deposited on a cooling belt, and when it has cooled to a friable state, it is transferred to a coarse granulator.\nA wider range of pigments is used with interior stains.\n\n【37】 #Radiation\nThe film-fortners for interior stains are usually very low-solids alkyd resin solutions.\nGenerally, the manufacture of stain is similar to that of paint.\n\n【38】 #Allied Coating Products\n\n【39】 #a. Putties\nThe manufacture of putties involves the dispersion of calcium sulfate in oils and adjustment with small amounts of solvent in a dough-type mixer or in a mixer known as a putty chaser .\nThe viscous putty is usually put into containers directly from the dispersion stage.\n\n【40】 #Laboratory Functions\nAnalytical and developmental laboratory functions are integral to the manufacture of coatings.\nFour functional types of laboratories are found in coatings manufacture: analytical, quality control, formulation or product development, and research and development .\nMany companies combine the various laboratory functions in one space; whereas, others separate each function.\nOther analytical laboratory functions include the analysis of competing products and \"bad batches\" of paint.\nQuality control laboratories test the product before it is packaged for various physical characteristics such as weight per gallon, viscosity, color, and drying time.\nIn the formulation or product development laboratory, existing products are refined.\nThis differs from the research and development laboratory which is involved with basic research and the development of completely new classes of products.\n\n【41】 #A. Injury and Illness Statistics\nThe number and severity of injuries and illnesses in the Paints, Varnishes, Lacquers, Enamels, and Allied Coating Products Industry (SIC code 285) may be estimated from information reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor .\n1980-1982  Average Incidence Rates per 100 Full-time Workers These data show an annual total of approximately 7,570 injuries and illnesses (employment times total case incidence rate divided by 100) in paint manufacturing facilities.\nPer 100 full-time workers, paint manufacturers had an average injury and illness incidence rate of 12.0 and an average lost workday incidence rate (severity rate) of 74.3, which are about the same as the average rates exhibited by \"All Manufacturing\" industries.\n\n【42】 #Also\n\n【43】 The highest incidence rates occurred in facilities with 20-249 workers. The most prevalent sources of injuries and illnesses were boxes, barrels, containers, packages, etc. (33.3%), working surfaces (10.7%), and chemicals (9.0%).\nThe back (24.4%) and fingers (11.5%) were the parts of the body most frequently affected .\nIn an attempt to better elucidate accident causal factors, 38 \"sources of injury\" (which included 81% of the total cases) were cross-tabula ted with the \"type of accident,\" \"nature of injury,\" and \"part of body affected\n\n【44】 Mention needs to be made of some of the data constraints of the SDS reporting system.\nAlthough there are about 300 subcategories of \"sources of injury,\" and 425 occupational classification codes, in many instances the subgroupings are still not useful for the purpose of quantifying accidents specific to paint manufacturing.\nFor instance, there might not be specific SDS categories for the inclusion of equipment typically used in the paint industry which would necessitate its being grouped into a broad category such as \"Machines, Not Elsewhere Classified.\"\nSimilarly, although there is an occupational classification for mixing operatives, individual facilities when filling out the workers' compensation form could have coded paint mixers in a number of other categories (e.g. miscellaneous operatives, machine operatives, not specified, etc.).\nA further difficulty encountered in the data base, when using it for analysis of accident causal factors, is that, by definition, the \"source of injury\" is the object identified as most responsible for causing the injury.\nThis may, in fact, not be directly associated with the actual cause of the accident.\nHowever, if a worker falls from a ladder and fractures his leg on the floor, the \"source of injury\" is the floor, which probably contributed very little to the actual cause of the accident.\ne. containers, handtrucks, dollies, skids, pallets, etc. were most often caused by overexertion and by being struck by falling objects.\nSprains, strains, contusions, bruises, cuts, and lacerations were the most common injuries; the back and fingers were the parts of the body most frequently affected.\nAn interesting finding was that 60% of the injuries caused by chemicals (i.e. 615 of 1,027) were from skin contact (absorption); 47% of these injuries were chemical burns of the skin.\nAnalysis of the SDS data by \"occupation\" yielded similar resultse. barrels, boxes, crates, etc. were the most common sources of injury (20-30%) in almost every occupational grouping.\nAs before, overexertion and \"struck by or against\" type accidents were the most prevalent, with the most common injuries also being sprains, contusions, and cuts. Exposure to chemicals again accounted for a significant proportion of injuries in many of the occupational groups, usually resulting in chemical burns of the skin. Nonproduction workers (clerks, salesmen, managers, chemists, secretaries, etc.), who make up about 51% of the workforce in SIC code 285 , accounted for 13% of the cases in the SDS file .\nConversely, production workers were involved in 87% of the injuries and illnesses in paint and allied coating products manufacturing although comprising only about 49% of the total workforce. Further analysis of the SDS data  showed that workers under 26 years of age accounted for about one-third of the injuries and illnesses and that workers under 31 years of age accounted for over half (51.6%).\nAlthough only about one-third of the SDS cases had length of service data, 36.9% of those injuries occurred within the first year with the company, 5 0 . 4 % within the first 2 years, and 69.9% within the first 5 years .\nDermatitis was the most common illness noted (41.2%).\nRecognition of occupational illness depends on the \"state of the art.\" Nevertheless, despite the underestimate of the incidence of occupational illnesses, it is evident that reducing injuries should be a high priority of the paint and allied coating products industry. Workers in paint and allied coating products facilities may be exposed to a wide variety of hazardous conditions during the performance of their jobs. The majority of these hazards exist, to some extent, throughout industry, although certain characteristics in the paint industry may magnify the degree of risk.\nThe hazards associated with the manufacture of paint and allied coating products involve materials handling; toxic, flammable, or explosive substances; and physical agents such as electrical shock, noise, heat, and cold.\nThese hazards can be present at various stages of production.\nInhalation is a primary route of exposure for materials handlers, but skin exposure and ingestion are also possible.\nDry materials such as pigments and additives can become airborne when containers leak or are ruptured and when materials are transferred.  pigments into grinding equipment and discarding empty bags can cause the surrounding plant areas to become contaminated with dust. Solvents are volatile and their vapors can escape when transferred in the open or if containers develop minor leaks or are accidentally ruptured. Because of both toxicity and danger of fire, solvent spills present a serious hazard to workers.\nMany substances used in paint and allied coating products are highly volatile and flammable or are explosive.\nThe fire and explosion risk is high wherever organic solvents are present.\nCombustible material can be ignited by a spark or by high temperatures.\nSources Preventing the accumulation of static electricity in the handling of liquid raw materials requires special techniques and precautions. Static electricity may be produced when nonconducting liquids flow through pipes or hoses; when liquids fall through the air in droplets or as a spray; when liquids are splashed around in tanks --in the mixing, pouring, pumping, filtering, and agitation of liquids; or when air or other gases bubble through liquids , 2. M a n u f a c t u r e of P a i n t s a n d L a c q u e r s There are a number of potential hazards that confront workers in the various processes involved in the manufacture of paints and lacquers.\n\n【45】 #a. Dispersion\nPigment and resin particles may enter the breathing zones of workers when mixer and mill hoppers are filled.\nAirborne particles may also result when the mixers and the mills are operated. Workers may also be exposed to solvents during the loading, operation, and cleaning of mills.\nA noise hazard may be associated with the use of ball and pebble mills, especially when the mills are improperly adjusted, as well as with the use of high-speed dispersers.\nThe noise levels at dispersion equipment such as Kady mills have been found to range from 109-114 dBA .\nSeveral mills operating simultaneously will have a combined sound pressure level greater than any individual mill.\nBall mills that do not have vibration isolators can be the source of structure-borne vibrations that could be reradiated by other objects in the building , Cleaning the dispersion equipment involves the use of solvents and may result in potential exposure by inhalation or skin absorption. Cleaning may be performed manually or by automatic solvent wash. Since roller mills are often cleaned manually, there is also the potential hazard of catching and crushing arms and fingers between rollers.\nTo Maintenance operations involve many of the same hazards associated with cleaning operations.\nNitrocellulose, which is used in lacquer production, is one of the most flammable materials used in the coatings industry; it will not burn when wet with water but becomes flammable when water is extracted and replaced with alcohol . When nitrocellulose is dry, it burns very rapidly and can be ignited by friction or impact , b. Thinning, Tinting, and Shading Although exposure to additives either as dusts or vapors can also occur, solvent exposure is the primary hazard associated with these adjustment procedures.\nSince quality control checks are often made during these operations, exposures can also occur during sampling and transport of samples to the laboratory. c. F i l l i n g Solvent exposure is also the primary hazard of filling operations. Such exposures may result from direct evaporation of the solvent as the coatings flow into containers or from the cleaning and maintenance of the filling apparatus, particularly the filters used in the first step of the operation.\nExtensive noise can be generated by the vibrating screens used for filtering.\nPackaging the products usually involves automated equipment with moving parts that may catch on clothing.\nBurns or vapor exposure may also result from the use of hot, melted glues to secure packaging and labels.\n\n【46】 #d. Handling Finished Products\nSafety hazards involved in handling finished coating products are similar to those involved in handling raw materials (e.g. lifting, slippery working surfaces, poor clearance, reduced visibility, etc.).\nFinished products are usually in sealed metal containers and present little respiratory hazard.\nAutomatic depalletizers are a potential source of excessive noise.\n\n【47】 #Manufacture of Varnishes\nVarnish production requires an external source of heat and, therefore, differs from paint and lacquer production. Temperatures associated with the manufacture of varnish are often 2 0 0°-6 0 0°F (93°-316°C) and cause the formation of gaseous substances during varnish cooking .\n\n【48】 #a. Kettle and Reactor Operation Hazards\nThe major hazards associated with the cooking stage in varnish production involve airborne exposures while loading the vessels or emissions while processing.\n or charging the reactor vessel is usually done by pumping in the liquid reactants such as oils, glycols, or acid anhydrides.\nWhen dry materials are added, they can release irritant dusts or vapors of maleic, phthalic, or fumaric anhydride.\nSplattered molten anhydride can harm eyes and skin. Moreover, temperature changes at vents and orifices must be avoided so that vapors of these materials will not condense and form pressure plugs.\n\n【49】 #Since\nthese reaction vessels are mostly closed systems, only inadvertent or fugitive emissions present a hazard to workers during the reaction phase. In a few cases, however, open kettles may still be used in the manufacture of varnishes. Some of the emissions given off during the cooking of varnishes include acrolein, phenol, aldehydes, ketones, glycerin, fatty acids, and carbon dioxide .\nMaximum reactor vessel emissions occur during \"sparging,\" when an inert gas is blown through the reactor to remove the water of reaction. Emissions from solvent cooking operations do not vary significantly with the size of the reactor, but are more a result of the volatility of the solvent being used and the size and efficiency of the condenser.\nStartup, process upset, shutdown, and, particularly, emergencies offer further potential for worker exposure . Ambient temperatures around reactors generally are not hazardous. However, when insulation or climate controls are inadequate, ambient temperatures may rise and workers may be subject to heat stress.\nIn direct-fired kettles or reaction vessels, the constant heating and cooling can cause metal fatigue and subsequent cracks in the vessel. These cracks can be sources of vapor leaks and fire hazards.\nAlso, open kettles, especially portable ones, pose the hazard of burns from contact with hot surfaces or from splattering material.\n\n【50】 #b. Thinning and Filtering\nExposure to solvents may occur during the thinning stage of varnish production.\nThinning is usually done in separate tanks but may be performed in the varnish or resin kettle itself.\nSolvent exposure may also occur during filtering but is more likely during the subsequent cleaning of the filters.\n\n【51】 #c. Equipment Cleaning\nThe cleaning of equipment (e.g. reactors, kettles, thinning tanks, filters, etc.) is another source of worker exposure to toxic substances.\nCleaning operations in confined spaces are especially hazardous.\nWorkers may be exposed by skin contact or inhalation. Equipment is also sometimes cleaned with hot caustic solutions that may affect the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.\nThe cleaning of filters may be performed manually or by automatic washing with solvents.\nRespiratory exposure to diatomaceous earths and dusts from other finely ground materials used as filter aids is possible.\n\n【52】 #Manufacture of Powder Coatings\nMany of the same types of hazards found during the manufacture of paints or varnishes also exist in the production of powder coatings.\nDust exposure can occur during the charging of hoppers, mixers, and grinders and in packaging.\nThe fine particle sizes associated with powder coatings increase the possibility of dust explosions , Inhalation of resin powders, pigments, curing agents, and other additives is the primary health hazard associated with the production of powder coatings.\n5. M a n u f a c t u r e of R a d i a t i o n -C u r a b l e C o a t i n g s Since the manufacture of radiation-curable coatings, which dry or cure as a result of radiation such as infrared, ultraviolet, and electron beam, is similar to that of other paints, so are most of its hazards. Radiation-curable coatings, however, contain reactive monomers in place of solvents.\nIn addition, ultraviolet-curable coatings also contain photoinitiators.\nBoth reactive monomers and photoinitiators may have acute or delayed effects on the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract causing skin sensitization and other effects .\nBecause of the likelihood of acute effects resulting from skin or eye contact with some components of radiation-curable coatings, this type of coating is manufactured in enclosed equipment.\nEnclosed equipment is also necessary to prevent vaporization of some components that have relatively high vapor pressures.\nVarious types of hazards are associated with acrylate monomers used in radiation-curable coatings.\nAcrylates cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, and skin.\nIn\n\n【53】 #Laboratory Functions\nIn addition to the hazards associated with the manufacture of coatings, the operations associated with laboratory functions may also expose workers to other chemical substances (e.g. reagents) and physical agents such as ultraviolet or infrared radiation, heat, cold, and ionizing radiation used in curing processes and in exposure tests.\nA potentially hazardous practice in laboratories involves spraying a coating to match colors.\nOften no exposure controls are used, and exposure to airborne coatings is likely.\nThis situation is easily remedied by providing a spray booth with negative pressure to remove the overspray and thus protect the worker.\n\n【54】 #C. Adverse Health Effects\nOSHA has promulgated occupational exposure standards for many of the chemicals used in the manufacture of paint and allied coating products. NIOSH has also evaluated many of these materials and has published Criteria Documents and other reports which have recommended occupational safety and health standards for them, including occupational exposure limits.\n\n【55】 The materials used in coatings vary greatly in their toxicity.\nSome have been shown to be biologically inert, and others are proven or potential occupational carcinogens.\nPigments are usually handled as finely divided solids that can readily become airborne; adhere to skin, hair, and clothing; and generally coat the work area with dust.\nThe primary routes of exposure to pigments are inhalation, skin contact, and eye exposure.\nIngestion of pigments can result from eating, smoking, or drinking in the work areas as well as from swallowing material gathered by the mucociliary clearance mechanism in the respiratory tract.\nThe volatility of m a n y organic solvents and resins at room temperature accounts for the likelihood that workers will be exposed to them by inhalation.\nExposure to solvents and resins by s k i n contact and skin absorption is also common.\nAn epidemiological study  was conducted on a cohort of 16,243 men from 32 plants who were employed in the manufacture of paint or varnish for at least one year after January 1, 1946.\nHowever, a statistically significant increased mortality risk from colon and rectal cancer (65 and 26 deaths observed, SMR's of 138 and 139, respectively)\nwere found. The workers were also divided into seven subgroups on the basis of the type of exposure.\nIn one of these subgroups (the pigment workers) there was a significant increase of liver cancer (7 deaths observed, SMR of 273, p<0.05).\nLacquer workers had increased, although not significant, liver cancer and leukemia (SMR's of 255 and 212, respectively).\nWithout such analyses, positive findings would likely be obscured by the dilution of the study population with persons with inadequate exposure and latency for chronic disease to manifest. There is no basis for the author's conclusions.\n\n【56】 #IV. M E T H O D S F O R W O R K E R P R O T E C T I O N\nThe occupational hazards that have been identified in the paint and allied coating products industry fall into three categories:\naccidents,  fires and explosions, and  exposures to toxic substances and physical agents.\nInjuries are reported among coatings industry workers about 18 times more frequently than illnesses  and are the major cause of lost worktime .\nThe possibility of fires and explosions exists where solvents and other flammable materials are used.\nWorkers who manufacture paint and allied coating products are also potentially exposed to numerous toxic solvents, pigments, film-formers, and additives.\nPossible adverse health effects resulting from exposure to m a n y of these materials, particularly components of some of the more recently developed products, are unknown.\nIn addition, workers are exposed to more than one substance at a time, and the possible synergistic or additive effects have not been determined.\n\n【57】 #A. Prevention of Accidents\nTo protect workers in the coatings industry, a critical objective is to reduce injuries. Sprains, strains, contusions, bruises, cuts, and lacerations constitute about 66% of the total injuries and illnesses in the coatings industry , The largest source of injuries and illnesses (about 33%) is associated with the handling of boxes, barrels, and containers . Accidents are caused by improper lifting, carrying a load that is too heavy, incorrect gripping, failure to wear appropriate protective clothing, and slips and falls resulting from sudden changes in friction between the shoes and the floor.\nIt is evident that reducing the number of injuries should be a high priority in the paint and allied coating products industry.\nGrimaldi and Simonds  suggested that the causes of all injuries can be divided into two categories:\nunsafe physical conditions and unsafe personal acts.\nUnsafe physical conditions are due to defects in the condition of equipment, errors in design, faulty planning, or omission of essential safety requirements for maintaining a relatively hazard-free physical environment.\n- Operating equipment at unsafe speeds.\n- Using unsafe or improper equipment (e.g. using a chisel with a \"mushroomed\" head, using the hands instead of a brush to remove chips from cutting machines, or using a screwdriver of incorrect size for the slot in the screwhead). o More stable qualities in the makeup of the workforce (i.e. more older, married workers with longer time on the job) were found.\nSafety control programs that have the preceding characteristics of workforces with low accident rates and that are oriented toward minimizing the number of unsafe conditions and acts should tend to reduce the number and severity of accidents and injuries in the coatings industry.\nHazard control programs are most effective when they include both specific corrective actions and demonstrable involvement by senior management.\nAlso, involvement of workers in decision processes leads to improvements in safety compliance .\n\n【58】 #Proper Lifting\nOverexertion in the workplace accounts for a large number of disabling injuries.\nMost of these injuries involve the act of manually handling materials.\nA detailed analysis of hazard identification and control involved in lifting is given in the NIOSH technical report, Work Practices Guide for Manual Lifting . It recommends that a job analysis be conducted for tasks associated with increased risk of injury; a detailed procedure for evaluating the analysis for lifting tasks is presented .\nFor workers to safely perform lifting jobs, employers should institute training, ergonomic/engineering controls, the use of materials handling aids and equipment, and the selection of appropriate individuals as discussed in the following sections.\n\n【59】 #a. T r a i n i n g\nThe training of workers in proper materials handling techniques is generally accepted as a potentially useful technique for reducing injuries.\nA The container itself affects safety directly through its weight and size and indirectly through the limitations it imposes on methods of holding and carrying it.\nContainers should be as small as possible. A compact load minimizes the compressive forces on the back because the center of gravity of the load can be brought close to the spinal column .\nWorker/container coupling affects the ability to exert forces on the object, to maintain grip, and to exercise control --all vital to safe handling. The major problems with most handles are insufficient hand clearance, sharp edges which can cut into the hand, and a handle diameter that is too small.\nHandle diameter should range from 2.5-3.8 cm (1.0-1.5 in). Handle width should be at least 11.5 cm (4.5 in) with 5.0 cm (2 in) clearance all around the handle.\nIf gloves are used, at least 2.5 cm (1 in) should be added to the width and the clearance .\nWorker/floor surface coupling is important for maintaining stability and preventing slips, trips, and falls.\nAccidents can be reduced by using good housekeeping procedures to reduce transient changes in surface friction such as spills, worn spots, and loose or irregular floors .\nAlthough manual materials handling operations rarely demand the fine visual discrimination of delicate assembly work, lighting can have a large effect on surface texture and depth perception. Low, angled illumination is recommended for enhancing surface texture to warn workers of changes in surface friction.\nColor contrasts should be used on the edges of steps, loading docks, and ramps.\n\n【60】 #c. Materials Handling Aids and Equipment\nThe use of materials handling aids (rollers, jacks, and platforms) and mechanical equipment (conveyors, cranes, hoists, hand trucks, and forklifts) can be helpful or necessary in many lifting tasks. Particularly useful are conveyors and other devices which convert lifting into sliding tasks.\n\n【61】 #d. Selection of Appropriate Individuals\nTo avoid worker-job mismatch, selection of individuals for some jobs is considered desirable. Criteria for selection are lacking, however.\nFor many industries the principal method has been self-selection by the workers based on their initial tolerance for the demands of the job, a poor choice for obvious reasons.\nOther selection methods that have been used are questionnaires on health and medical history; and tests of visual, auditory, and pulmonary function, of blood pressure, mobility, etc. often with the addition of a chest x ray. However, such tests have poor predictive power.\nIn particular, x rays of the musculoskeletal system have little value in identifying workers who develop back injuries, and their routine use in screening employees is discouraged by medical authorities . The most useful procedure is a medical history coupled with an objective test of performance capacity (e.g. strength testing).\n\n【62】 #M a c h i n e G u a r d i n g / R e d e s i g n\nAn important area of occupational safety and health is that which protects the operator from the hazards of machine operations.\nOSHA requires in 29 CFR 1910.212 that one or more methods shall be provided to protect the operator and other workers in the machine area from hazards such as those created by point of operation, in-running nip points, rotating parts, flying chips, sparks, power transmission equipment, etc. Guards shall be affixed to the machine where possible.\nWorkers who use powered handtools in chipping operations are exposed to hand-arm vibration and potential risk of developing vibration syndrome (also known as vibration white finger and Raynaud's phenomenon). Vibration syndrome has adverse circulatory and neural effects in the fingers; the signs and symptoms include numbness, pain, and blanching (turning pale and ashen) .\nNIOSH recommends that jobs be redesigned to minimize the use of vibrating tools and that powered handtools be redesigned to minimize vibration .\n\n【63】 #Noise Control\nNoise must be controlled wherever it is excessive, both as a means of preventing accidents and as protection from hearing loss.\nThe noise in dispersion and filling operations is of special concern  as is the use of powered handtools to chip layers of coatings from the insides of containers .\nUnder the provisions of the OSHA Occupational Noise Standard ,29 CFR 1910.\n\n【64】 #S O U N D P R E S S U R E L E V E L S (dBA) A T D I F F E R E N T L O C A T I O N S A R O U N D A B A L L M I L L\nby Communication Channels, Inc.

P r e v e n t i o n of F i r e s a n d E x p l o s i o n s\nMany of the organic substances used in the manufacture of paint and allied coating products are highly flammable, and some are also explosive.\nThus, fires and explosions are a constant threat in most manufacturing operations where solvents and other flammable materials are used.\n\n【66】 #Static Electricity\nThe handling of the flammable or explosive liquid raw materials used in the coatings industry requires special techniques and precautions to prevent the accumulation of static electricity.\nDuring the transfer of the solvents from one container to another (whether in bulk or in small amounts), effective bonding and grounding should be used to prevent the accumulation of static electricity , \"Bonding\" is the process of connecting two or more conductive objects together by means of a conductor , \"Grounding\" is the process of connecting a conductive object to the ground and is a specific form of bonding ,\nFill pipes should go to the bottom of tanks, drums, etc. to minimize the generation of static electricity in the free fall of flammable solvents . Drums cleaned by steam should be electrically bonded to steam lines, and the entire assembly should be grounded.\nBefore drums are emptied, they should be supported and blocked to prevent movement.\nExamples of bonding and grounding arrangements are shown in Figures IV-2, IV-3, IV-4, IV-5, and IV-6.

TYPICAL GROUNDING ARRANGEMENT FOR THINNING  MIXING EQUIPMENT\nby The Sherwin-Williams Company.\n\n【69】 #Reprinted with permission by the Department of Health and Human\nServices.\n\n【70】 #Work Practices\nProcedures and precautions for preventing fires and explosions include:\nregular inspection of equipment and storage tanks,  immediate repair of leaks, pumps, and lines,  periodic testing of pressure equipment, and  ventilation to reduce vapor concentrations.\nContainers of solvents or hot resins should be tightly covered at all times except when material is transferred.\nContainers of not more than five gallons capacity, having a spring-closing lid and spout cover and so designed to safely relieve internal pressure when subjected to fire exposure, should be used to hold working amounts of solvents.\nSince small amounts of residue may remain and present a fire hazard, containers that have held solvents should be thoroughly cleaned with steam and then drained and dried before re-use.\nFittings and open heaters should be prohibited except in specified areas.\nFire hazards around tank trucks and cars can be reduced by turning off their motors and not starting them during loading or unloading operations.\nGood housekeeping is also imperative to prevent fires.\nAfter eliminating potential sources of ignition, spills should be cleaned up immediately after the area is ventilated.\nStopping leaks and spills will eliminate fire hazards and help conserve raw materials, keep chemicals out of the effluent system, and reduce worker exposure. Combustible materials such as cleaning rags should be disposed of in metal containers filled with water . Specific OSHA requirements for the storage and handling of flammable and combustible liquids are given in 29 CFR 1910.106.\n\n【71】 #C. Controlling Exposures to Toxic Substances\nExposure to the thousands of raw materials (i.e. pigments, solvents, film-formers, and additives) used in the paint and allied coating products industry also poses a potential hazard.\nA variety of technologies such as process enclosure, modification of existing equipment, mechanical pumping systems, local exhaust ventilation, hazardous substance identification systems, protective clothing and equipment, and implementation of safe work practices can be used to control exposures to toxic substances.\nThe conclusions of a NIOSH-sponsored study  indicate that the coatings industry relies on relatively well-known technology and uses equipment and procedures that are commonly used in a wide variety of other industries.\nFor the industries within the SIC code 2851, data are available from OSHA health inspections completed during the period June 1979 to January 1984.\n\n【72】 The majority of tests (94%) showed that the concentrations of the substances evaluated were within applicable Federal standards.\nOn the basis of these tests, it can be concluded that it is probably feasible in the coatings industry, through engineering controls and effective work practices, to limit exposures to most hazardous substances to within Federal s tandards. To identify specific hazards, comprehensive industrial hygiene evaluations (including appropriate measurements) should be conducted.\nSuch evaluations should be conducted at least yearly or when any change in process, raw material, or engineering control occurs which could result in increased exposure to toxic substances.\n\n【73】 #Informing Workers of Hazards\nOSHA on November 21, 1983, promulgated an occupational safety and health standard titled \"Hazard Communication.\" Under the provisions of this standard ,29 CFR 1910,29 CFR .1200 The hazard communication program is to be written and is to be made available to workers and their designated representatives. Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors are required to ensure that containers of hazardous chemicals leaving their workplaces are labeled, tagged, or marked with the identity, appropriate hazard warnings, and the name and address of the manufacturer or other responsible party.\nEmployers must ensure that labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced unless they are immediately replaced with other labels containing the required information.\nEach container in the workplace must be prominently labeled, tagged, or marked with the identity of hazardous chemicals contained therein along with hazard warnings appropriate for worker protection.\nIf there are a number of stationary containers within a work area which have similar contents and hazards, the employer may post signs or placards which convey the hazard information required rather than individually labeling each container.\nHowever, these written materials must contain the same information as is required on the labels and must be readily accessible to workers in the work areas.\nPipes or piping systems are exempted altogether from the OSHA labeling requirements although NIOSH recommends that filler ports and outlets be labeled.\nIn addition, NIOSH recommends that a system should be set up to ensure that pipes containing hazardous materials are identified to avoid accidental cutting and discharge of hazardous materials.\nAccording to the OSHA definition of \"immediate use,\" for the exemption to apply, the container must be under the control of the worker performing the transfer and must be used only within the workshift in which it is transferred.\nThe OSHA Hazard Communication standard requires chemical manufacturers and importers to develop a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each hazardous chemical they produce or import. Employers in the manufacturing sector (which includes paint and allied coating products manufacturing) are required to obtain or develop a MSDS for each hazardous chemical used in their workplaces. The MSDS is required to provide specific information such as the chemical and common names for the hazardous chemical.\nFor hazardous chemical mixtures, each component which comprises 1% or more and which is itself a health hazard must be listed. Any chemical which is determined to be a carcinogen must be listed if it is present in quantities of 0.1% or greater.\nIngredients present in concentrations of less than one percent must also be listed if there is evidence that the permissible exposure limit may be exceeded or if it could present a health hazard in those concentrations.\nThe NIOSH publication, A Recommended Standard--An Identification System for Occupationally Hazardous Materials , can be used as a guide when preparing the MSDS\nEmployers are to establish a training program for all workers exposed to hazardous chemicals.\nTraining is to be provided at the time of initial assignment and whenever a new chemical hazard is introduced into their work area.\nWorkers are to be informed of specific hazards involved in any operations in their work areas where hazardous chemicals are present.\nThis may be done by individual chemical or by categories of hazards, but in any case the worker is to be aware that information is available on the specific hazards of individual chemicals through the MSDS.\nWorkers are also to be trained regarding methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of hazardous chemicals ,e.g. monitoring conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when being released, etc. Bulk handling methods for liquid raw materials which include techniques for bulk storage, piping, mechanical pumping (rather than pouring), and metering liquids minimize the opportunity for volatile liquids to contact ambient air.\n\n【74】 Pigment is blown from trailers or rail cars into a steel storage silo.\nFrom the silo, pigment is blown through piping to a use bin located on the roof of the manufacturing building directly over the mixing area.\nWeighed quantities of pigment are delivered directly or via batch dollies to mixers.\nA low-level sensor actuates the transfer system to feed pigment from the silo when the pigment falls to a preselected level.\nDespite precautions, the area around dispersion equipment often becomes quite dusty and frequent vacuum cleaning is recommended . Compressed air should not be used to remove pigment dust from clothing or work surfaces because it will result in the secondary generation of airborne dust.\nIt is also recommended that soiled clothing not be taken home for cleaning but be cleaned either by an industrial laundry or an on-site facility.\nWhen solvents or caustic solutions are used for cleaning dispersion equipment, it is important to avoid skin, eye, and inhalation exposures, which are especially likely to occur during manual cleaning.\nBecause caustics may react violently with aluminum, caustic solutions should not be used to clean out tanks that have contained aluminum paint .\nSpecial precautions should also be taken in the handling of aluminum paste or powder which can generate hydrogen gas when in contact with moisture . When this occurs in closed containers of aluminum pigments, sufficient pressure may build up to cause an explosion and fire .\nSpills are likely to occur during filling operations when automated equipment malfunctions.\nImmediate spill cleanup can reduce vapor release.\nWorker training programs that address techniques for spill cleanup are useful.\nFor major spills, some useful special procedures include the use of protective equipment (e.g. rubber boots), portable ventilation, absorbent material ,e.g. floor sweeping compound, sawdust, -j Contact with coatings or their components (especially radiation-curable coatings) should be avoided, if possible, but should be followed by the immediate washing of contaminated skin with soap and water, immediate flushing of exposed eyes with copious amounts of water, and quick removal of contaminated clothing.\nSCALE M IX IN G T A N K S DUST C O LLE C T O R D ELIVER Y PIPE -U N L O A D IN G PIPE B IN A C T IV A T O R .FEEDER C O N V E Y IN G BLOW ER\nExposure of workers to toxic substances may also occur through the use of food, beverages, or tobacco products in areas where toxic substances are present.\nPrearranged plans should be established for administering first aid and emergency medical care and for transportation of injured workers.\nFirefighting procedures should also be established and implemented.\nPersonnel who may be required to shut off sources of solvents, clean up spills, and repair leaks should be properly trained in the appropriate procedures.\nIn case of fire, solvent sources should be shut off or removed.\nChemical foam, carbon dioxide, or dry chemicals should be used for fighting solvent fires, and proper respiratory protection and clothing should be worn.\nNonessential workers should be evacuated from exposure areas during emergencies.\nWarning or alarm systems should be considered to alert workers to possible hazardous exposures during emergencies .\nEntry into confined or enclosed spaces where there is limited egress, such as tanks, pits, trucks and tank cars, and process vessels, should be controlled by a permit system.\nFurther\n\n【75】 #Substitution of Raw Materials\nOccupational health hazards can also be controlled by the substitution of raw materials.\nBecause of their potential for environmental damage or consumer injury, the use of lead, chromates, and mercury compounds and various highly volatile solvents in many applications has been reduced or eliminated with replacement by other, less hazardous substances. An example is the use of zinc metal, zinc oxide, molybdates, and phosphates instead of lead and chromates as pigments in industrial maintenance coatings or the use of cuprous oxide or organotin compounds in antifouling paints rather than organic mercury, lead, and arsenic compounds .\nIn addition, many potent paint and varnish removers such as benzene, phenol, and cresols are no longer used , Another type of raw material substitution being utilized in paint manufacturing involves replacing dry pigments with pigment slurries .\n\n【76】 #Engineering Controls\nOccupational exposures to hazardous substances should be controlled at the source of the hazard wherever feasible.\nThis can be achieved by process or equipment modification, isolation of stored materials and processes, and local exhaust ventilation.\nOne of the most effective methods of dust control during the weighing and assembling of raw materials is a system that utilizes a closed fabricated metal booth that rests on top of the mixer and is connected by ducts to both a dust collector and an empty bag shredder.\nThe pigment falls through the cut in the bag into the mixer, and the empty bag is lifted slightly by the worker and is drawn upward and away by suction .\nAnother method that can effectively control dust and vapor is the use of a ventilated booth where materials are weighed or transferred. This results in reduced worker exposure and a decrease in the amount of dust and vapor released into the general workroom air. Dust-laden air that is exhausted should be collected in bag houses or forced through scrubbers or electrostatic precipitators.\nVapor-laden air can be scrubbed, incinerated, condensed, or adsorbed , Portable exhaust ventilation is another common control technique. This is accomplished with a hood attached to a flexible duct that leads to a fan. The effectiveness of this type of control varies, depending on the type of hood used, its placement, and its face velocity. Portable exhaust ventilation is generally, but not necessarily, less effective than ventilated hoods that enclose or confine a contaminant because exhaust volumes are large and control can be easily upset by cross drafts in the area .\n\n【77】 #HIGH SPEED MIXING TANK R E C O V E R E D P IG M E N T R E C Y C L E FO R DA RK P R IM E R P A IN T S TO SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL\nEnclosed equipment, such as ball or pebble mills, is free of vapor release during operation, but this is not the case with high-speed dispersers, which are open to the air. The use of covers and lids on containers can reduce vapor emissions. This is especially true during the thinning, tinting, and shading operations when temporary containers often remain open for long periods of time while laboratory analysis and subsequent adjustments are performed.\nSand mills often discharge into open portable tanks resulting in potential solvent emissions .\nSince vapors are emitted when containers are filled with solvent-based coatings, exhaust ventilation may be needed at the point of filling.\nBecause of the heat required and the by-products that need to be controlled, operations in varnish manufacture differ from other operations in the paint and allied coating products industry.\nBoth reactors and open and closed kettles are used to produce varnishes with the hazard of exposure to toxic emissions being greatest for open kettles.\nEmissions are generated during cooking processes when kettles are opened for charging or product sampling.\nMost kettles are currently fitted with retractable hoods and exhaust systems, some of which incorporate solvent condensers .\nVentilation systems used to control vapors are most effective when designed to control vapors generated at temperatures higher than the ambient air .\nCondensed vapors collect to some extent as a sticky film on the relatively cool hood and duct walls, necessitating frequent cleaning and maintenance.\nHood design should provide for access to the kettle during use of the hood and should be designed to prevent contamination or exposure by the dripping of condensate from its inner surfaces . Varnish production vapor emissions can be controlled by water scrubbing, combustion, vapor incineration, high stack dispersal, or condensation ,\nScreens or guards can be used to shield workers from contact with hot surfaces and from radiant heat.\nIn some cases, protective qlothing (particularly gloves) is useful.\nWith open kettles, the hot material can splatter on workers.\nThis hazard can be prevented, however, by covering the kettles or by using enclosures or splatter-gua rd s. Measurements of the effectiveness of the system should also be made as soon as possible after any change in production, process, or control which may result in any increase in airborne contaminants.\nIt is essential that any scheme that involves exhausting air from a work area should also provide for a positive means of bringing in at least an equal volume of air from the outside, conditioning it, and evenly distributing it throughout the exhausted area.\nThe\n\n【78】 #Personal Protective Clothing and Equipment\nWorkers should use appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment which must be carefully selected, used, and maintained to be effective. The SDS data  indicated that 60% of the injuries or illnesses associated with chemicals or chemical compounds were caused by skin contact and 47% resulted in chemical burns.\nTo prevent skin contact, gloves, aprons, boots, etc. should be made of materials resistant to the hazardous substances in question, particularly the solvents. Splash-proof chemical safety goggles or face shields, (20-30 cm minimum) should be worn in any operation in which there is a likelihood of a solvent, caustic, or other toxic substance being splashed into the eyes.\n\n【79】 #Medical Surveillance\nThe medical officer responsible for the health of workers should be apprised of potential workplace hazards, based on safety and health evaluations, and appropriate medical surveillance should be conducted. The number and type of tests to be performed should be based on the substance or hazards to which the worker may be exposed. In any case, preplacement examinations should be performed and should include at least a medical and occupational history, a comprehensive physical examination, and a judgement of the worker's ability to use positive or negative pressure respirators.\nEmergency first-aid programs should be developed that are based on the results of the workplace occupational safety and health evaluation.\nPeriodic examinations should be carried out at the discretion of the responsible physician based on the adverse health effects and nature of the hazards identified.\nHealth hazards identified for which NIOSH has made specific recommendations should be addressed in accordance with those specific recommendations.\nPertinent medical records of all workers should be kept by employers for at least 30 years after termination of employment.

The genus Coxiella is morphologically similar to Rickettsia, but with a variety of genetic and physiological differences. C. burnetii is a small Gram-negative bacterium that is highly resistant to environmental stresses such as high temperature, osmotic pressure, and ultraviolet light. These characteristics are attributed to a small cell variant form of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle, including a more metabolically and replicatively active large cell variant form. It can survive standard disinfectants, and is resistant to many other environmental changes like those presented in the phagolysosome.\n\n【2】 #Pathogenesis\nThe ID50 (the dose needed to infect 50% of experimental subjects) is one via inhalation; i.e. inhalation of one organism will yield disease in 50% of the population. This is an extremely low infectious dose (only 1-10 organisms required), making C. burnetii one of the most infectious known organisms. Disease occurs in two stages: an acute stage that presents with headaches, chills, and respiratory symptoms, and an insidious chronic stage.\nWhile most infections clear up spontaneously, treatment with tetracycline or doxycycline appears to reduce the symptomatic duration and reduce the likelihood of chronic infection. A combination of erythromycin and rifampin is highly effective in curing the disease, and vaccination with Q-VAX vaccine (CSL) is effective for prevention of it.\n\n【3】 #Genomics\nThere are currently at least 5 completely sequenced genomes of Coxiella burnetti  which contain about 2.1 Mbp of DNA each and encode around 2,100 open reading frames. 746 (or about 35%) of these genes have no known function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:12:56"}

It can measure the time-dependent response of a system to well-defined external stimuli.\n\n【1】 ## Dielectric relaxation time\nFor instance, the properties of a dielectric change on a time scale determined by the relaxation time when an external electric field is changed. This so-called dielectric relaxation time is a property of a solid that is closely related to its conductivity. The dielectric relaxation time is a measure of the time it takes for charge in a semiconductor to become neutralized by conduction process. It is small in metals and can be large in semiconductors and insulators.\n\n【2】 ## Amorphous solids\nAn amorphous solid, such as amorphous indomethacin displays a temperature dependence of molecular motion, which can be quantified as the average relaxation time for the solid in a metastable supercooled liquid or glass to approach the molecular motion characteristic of a crystal. Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to quantify enthalpy change due to molecular structural relaxation.\n\n【3】 ## Mathematical example: Damped unforced oscillator\nLet the homogenous differential equation:\nm\\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2}+\\gamma\\frac{d y}{d t}+ky=0\nmodel damped unforced oscillations of a weight on a spring.\nThe displacement will then be of the form y(t) = A e^{-t/T} \\cos(\\mu t - \\delta). The constant T is called the relaxation time of the system and the constant μ is the quasi-frequency.\n\n【4】 ## Astronomy\nIn astronomy, relaxation time relates to clusters of gravitationally-interacting bodies (star clusters, galaxy clusters, globular clusters). The relaxation time is a measure of the time it takes for one object in a system to be significantly perturbed by other objects in the system. In the case of stars in a galaxy, the relaxation time measures the time for one star to undergo a strong encounter with another star. Various events occur on timescales relating to the relaxation time, including core collapse and energy exchange between stars (minimization of the total energy in a cluster).\nThe relaxation time is related to the velocity of a body (typically a star) and the perturbation rate. In the example of a star cluster, a particular star will have an orbit with a velocity v. As the star passes by other stars, the orbit will be perturbed by the gravitational field of nearby stars.

Along with neurofibromatosis type II (a.k.a. MISME syndrome), tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, NF1 is a member of the phakomatoses or neurocutaneous syndrome, all of which have both neurologic and dermatologic lesions. This grouping is historical and based on disease pathology rather than genetic diagnosis.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 was fully described in1882 by German pathologyst Friedrich von Recklinghausen, for which the disorder was eponymously named after him (von Recklinghausen disease), although the recognition of individuals with this phenotype probably dates back from the Hellenistic era.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThere is no established system for the classification of neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal syndrome caused by a mutation in gene NF1 of chromosome 17, wich leads to a defective neurofibromin 1 protein. This mutation constitutes a phenotype with very pathognomonic features that are not always present; among them are the presence of Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, scoliosis, cognitive disabilities, vision disorders, multiple café au lait spots and epilepsy.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 can be caused 50% of the time due to an autosomal dominant inherited pattern with the other 50% beign caused due to a de novo mutation on NF1 gene\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Neurofibromatosis type 1 from Other Diseases\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 should be differentiated from other genetic disorders who present with overlapping features, such as Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Carney complex, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Cowden syndrome, Acromegaly/gigantism, Pituitary adenoma, Hyperparathyroidism, Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, Adrenocortical carcinoma.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common single gene disorder in humans, occurring in about 30 to 40 in 100,000 births worldwide.\nThe country with major prevalence of neurofibromatosis type 1 reported is Israel, while the one with the least reported in Denmark.\nOlder paternal age may increase the chances for de novo mutations in NF1 gene.\nThere is no race or gender predilection for neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThe biggest risk factor for acquiring neurofibromatosis type 1 is a family history of this disorder. Advanced paternal age increases the risk of an NF1 de novo mutation. There is no identified modifiable risk factor for acquiring neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is acquiered 50% of the time by inheritance. Screening is made by taking a family history and a physical examination, and confirmed with genetic testing. Prenatal screening is controversial.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nNeurofibromatosis Type 1 manifestations vary widely among patients, from individuals with absent symptoms to rapidly progressive disorders. The most common complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 is disfigurement due to skin lesions. Prognosis will depend on the number of commorbidities, but it is usually moderately good. Life expectancy is usually reduced by 8-12 years, being malignant tumors the most common cause of death.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is mainly diagnosed clinically. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is usually diagnosed early on in childhood. Genetic testing may be necessary in difficult cases.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 manifestations vary widely among patients, from individuals with absent symptoms to rapidly progressive disorders. The most common complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 is disfigurement due to skin lesions Prognosis will depend on the number of commorbidities, but it is usually moderately good. Life expectancy is usually reduced by 8-12 years, being malignant tumors the most common cause of death.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 physical examination may vary widely among patients. The most common features are the presence of neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, cafe au lait macules (CALM), delayed puberty features, and cognitive impairment. Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be diagnosed clinically with great specificity and sensitivity by the presence of 2 characteristic features on physical examination, although many children with the NF1 gene mutation may not meet the criteria at age 1, but will do so at 8 years old in 97% of the cases.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nMetabolic and chemical laboratory studies usually appear normal in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 gene mutation can be diagnosed using linkage analysis and gene sequencing.\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no characteristic ECG findings associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【16】 ## X-ray\nThere are no typical x-ray findings associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, however, X-rays may be helpful in the diagnosis of other complications such as scoliosis, slender long bones, skeletal dysplasia, tibial pseudoarthrosis, and osteoporosis.\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nThere are no echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\nThe use of routine screening brain CT scans in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is controversial.\n\n【19】 ## MRI\nMRI is the preferred study method when studying the central nervous system (CNS). The use of routine screening brain MRI in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is controversial.\n\n【20】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nThere are no other diagnostic studies associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【21】 ## Medical Therapy\nThere is no treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1; the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. Therapy for a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 is aimed at decreasing symptoms and improving quality of life. At every age, different problems may develop, so a specific approach is necessary for the age and presentation of the individual. Supportive therapy for neurofibromatosis type 1 includes pain relief, psychotherapy, and antidepressants.\n\n【22】 ## Interventions\nThere are no recommended therapeutic interventions for the management of neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is only used as a palliative, rather than curative therapy. Surgery can be helpful for the correction of some neurofibromatosis type 1 bone malformations and for removal of painful or disfiguring tumors.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 has a wide range of comorbidities, regular multidisciplinary follow-ups are mandatory. Annual mammogram and ophtalmologic examination should be made in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurocognitive evaluation and blood pressure measurements should be done regularly to record evolution and detect secondary causes of impairment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:28:06"}

Trovafloxacin use exceeding 2 weeks in duration is associated with a significantly increased risk of serious liver injury. Liver injury has also benn reportes following trovafloxacin re-exposure. clinicians should monitor liver function test (e.g. AST, ALT, bilirubin) in trovafloxacin recipients who develop signs or symptoms consistent with hepatitis. Clinicians should consider discontinuing travofloxacin in those patients who develop liver function test abnormalities.\n- The safety and effectiveness of trovafloxacin in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years age, pregnant women, and nursing women have not been established.\n- As with other members of the quinolone class, trovafloxacin has caused arthropathy and/or chondrodysplasia in immature rats and dogs\n- Convulsions, increased intracranial pressure and psychosis have been reported in patients receiving quinolones. Quinolones may also cause central nervous system stimulation which may lead to tremors, restlessness, lightheadedness, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, nightmares and insomnia. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving trovafloxacin or alatrofloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted.\n- Trovafloxacin mesylate should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines and airway management, as clinically indicated.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nOver 6000 patients have been treated with trovafloxacin mesylate in multidose clinical efficacy trials worldwide.\nIn trovafloxacin mesylate studies the majority of adverse reactions were described as mild in nature (over 90% were described as mild or moderate). Trovafloxacin mesylate was discontinued for adverse events thought related to drug in 5% of patients (dizziness 2.4%, nausea 1.9%, headache 1.1%, and vomiting 1.0%).\nDizziness/lightheadedness on trovafloxacin mesylate is generally mild, lasts for a few hours following a dose, and in most cases, resolves with continued dosing. The incidence of dizziness and lightheadedness in trovafloxacin mesylate patients over 65 years is 3.1% and 0.6%, respectively.\ntrovafloxacin mesylate appears to have a low potential for phototoxicity. In clinical trials with trovafloxacin mesylate, only mild, treatment-related phototoxicity was observed in less than 0.03% (2/7096) of patients.\nAdditional reported drug-related events in clinical trials (remotely, possibly, probably or unknown) that occurred in <1% of trovafloxacin mesylate-treated patients are:\n- APPLICATION/INJECTION/INSERTION SITE: Application/injection/insertion site device complications, inflammation, pain, edema - AUTONOMIC NERVOUS: flushing, increased sweating, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, increased saliva - CARDIOVASCULAR: peripheral edema, chest pain, thrombophlebitis, hypotension, palpitation, periorbital edema, hypertension, syncope, tachycardia, angina pectoris, bradycardia, peripheral ischemia, edema, dizziness postural\n- GASTROINTESTINAL: altered bowel habit, constipation, diarrhea-Clostridium difficile, dyspepsia, flatulence, loose stools, gastritis, dysphagia, increased appetite, gastroenteritis, rectal disorder, colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, enteritis, eructation, gastrointestinal disorder, melena, hiccup\n- ORAL CAVITY: gingivitis, stomatitis, altered saliva, tongue disorder, tongue edema, tooth disorder, cheilitis, halitosis - HEMATOPOIETIC: anemia, granulocytopenia, hemorrhage unspecified, leukopenia, prothrombin decreased, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia - LIVER/BILIARY: increased hepatic enzymes, hepatic function abnormal, bilirubinemia, discolored feces, jaundice\n- METABOLIC/NUTRITIONAL: hyperglycemia, thirst\n- MUSCULOSKELETAL: arthralgia, muscle cramps, myalgia, muscle weakness, skeletal pain, tendinitis, arthropathy\n- PSYCHIATRIC: anxiety, anorexia, agitation, nervousness, somnolence, insomnia, depression, amnesia, concentration impaired, depersonalization, dreaming abnormal, emotional lability, euphoria, hallucination, impotence, libido decreased-male, paroniria, thinking abnormal\n- REPRODUCTIVE: Female: leukorrhea, menstrual disorder; Male: balanoposthitis - RESPIRATORY: dyspnea, rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchospasm, coughing, epistaxis, respiratory insufficiency, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, asthma, hemoptysis, hypoxia, stridor - SKIN/APPENDAGES: pruritus ani, skin disorder, skin ulceration, angioedema, dermatitis, dermatitis fungal, photosensitivity skin reaction, seborrhea, skin exfoliation, urticaria - SPECIAL SENSES: dysgeusia, eye pain, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, photophobia, conjuctival hemorrhage, hyperacusis, scotoma, tinnitus, visual field defect, diplopia, xerophthalmia - URINARY SYSTEM: dysuria, face edema, micturition frequency, interstitial nephritis, renal failure acute, renal function abnormal, urinary incontinence\n- LABORATORY CHANGES: Changes in laboratory parameters, without regard to drug relationship, occurring in ≥1% of trovafloxacin mesylate-treated patients were: decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit; increased platelets; decreased and increased WBC; eosinophilia; increased ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), and alkaline phosphatase; decreased protein and albumin; increased BUN and creatinine; decreased sodium; and bicarbonate. It is not known whether these abnormalities were caused by the drug or the underlying condition being treated.\nThe incidence and magnitude of liver function abnormalities with trovafloxacin mesylate were the same as comparator agents except in the only study in which oral trovafloxacin mesylate was administered for 28 days. In this study (chronic bacterial prostatitis) nine percent (13/140) of trovafloxacin mesylate-treated patients experienced elevations of serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) of ≥3 times the upper limit of normal. These liver function test abnormalities generally developed at the end of, or following completion of, the planned 28-day course of therapy, but were not associated with concurrent elevations of related laboratory measures of hepatic function (such as serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or lactate dehydrogenase). Patients were asymptomatic with these abnormalities, which generally returned to normal within 1–2 months after discontinuation of therapy.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nAdverse reactions reported with trovafloxacin mesylate during the post-marketing period include:\n- GASTROINTESTINAL: symptomatic pancreatitis.\n- GENERAL/OTHER: anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.\n- HEMATOPOIETIC: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia.\n- LIVER/BILIARY: symptomatic hepatitis (some patients experienced an associated peripheral eosinophilia), liver failure (including acute hepatic necrosis with eosinophilic infiltration). trovafloxacin mesylate-associated liver enzyme abnormalities and/or symptomatic hepatitis have occurred during short-term or long-term therapy.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\n- Antacids, Sucralfate, and Iron: The absorption of oral trovafloxacin is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of some antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, citric acid/sodium citrate (Bicitra), as well as sucralfate and iron (ferrous ions). These agents as well as formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as Videx, (Didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution, should be taken at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after oral trovafloxacin administration.\n- Morphine: Co-administration of intravenous morphine significantly reduces the absorption of oral trovafloxacin. Intravenous morphine should be administered at least 2 hours after oral trovafloxacin mesylate dosing in the fasted state and at least 4 hours after oral trovafloxacin mesylate is taken with food. Trovafloxacin administration had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of morphine or its metabolite, morphine-6-β-glucuronide.\n- Minor pharmacokinetic interactions without clinical significance have been observed with co-administration of trovafloxacin mesylate Tablets with caffeine, omeprazole and calcium carbonate.\n- Alatrofloxacin should not be co-administered with any solution containing multivalent cations, e.g. magnesium, through the same intravenous line.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nAn increase in skeletal variations was observed in rat fetuses after daily oral 75 mg/kg maternal doses of trovafloxacin (approximately 15 times the highest recommended human dose based on mg/kg or 2 times based upon body surface area) were administered during organogenesis. However, fetal skeletal variations were not observed in rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg trovafloxacin. Evidence of fetotoxicity (increased perinatal mortality and decreased body weights) was also observed in rats at 75 mg/kg. Daily oral doses of trovafloxacin at 45 mg/kg (approximately 9 times the highest recommended human dose based on mg/kg or 2.7 times based upon body surface area) in the rabbit were not associated with an increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations or malformations.\nOral doses of trovafloxacin >5mg/kg were associated with an increased gestation time in rats, and several dams at 75 mg/kg experienced uterine dystocia.\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. trovafloxacin mesylate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Trovafloxacin mesylate in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Trovafloxacin mesylate during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\nTrovafloxacin is excreted in human milk and was found in measurable concentrations in the breast milk of lactating subjects.\nBecause of the potential for unknown effects from trovafloxacin in nursing infants from mothers taking trovafloxacin, a decision should be made either to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of trovafloxacin in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established. Quinolones, including trovafloxacin, cause arthropathy and osteochondrosis in juvenile animals of several species.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\nIn multiple-dose clinical trials of trovafloxacin, 27% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 12% of patients were ≥75 years of age. The overall incidence of drug-related adverse reactions, including central nervous system and gastrointestinal side effects, was less in the ≥65 year group than the other age groups.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere are no significant differences in trovafloxacin pharmacokinetics between males and females when differences in body weight are taken into account. After single 200 mg doses, trovafloxacin Cmax and AUC(0–∞) were 60% and 32% higher, respectively, in healthy females compared to healthy males. Following repeated daily administration of 200 mg for 7 days, the Cmax for trovafloxacin was 38% higher and AUC(0–24) was 16% higher in healthy females compared to healthy males. The clinical importance of the increases in serum levels of trovafloxacin in females has not been established.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Trovafloxacin mesylate with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of trovafloxacin are not affected by renal impairment. Trovafloxacin serum concentrations are not significantly altered in subjects with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <20 mL/min), including patients on hemodialysis.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nFollowing repeated administration of 100 mg for 7 days to patients with mild cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A), the AUC(0–24) for trovafloxacin was increased ~45% compared to matched controls. Repeated administration of 200 mg for 7 days to patients with moderate cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class B) resulted in an increase of ~50% in AUC(0–24) compared to matched controls. There appeared to be no significant effect on trovafloxacin Cmax for either group. The oral clearance of trovafloxacin was reduced ~30% in both cirrhosis groups, which corresponded to prolongation of half life by 2–2.5 hours (25–30% increase) compared to controls. There are no data in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nTrovafloxacin and alatrofloxacin did not affect the fertility of male or female rats at oral and I.V. doses of 75 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are 15 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/kg or approximately 2 times based on mg/m2. However, oral doses of trovafloxacin at 200 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/kg or about 6 times based on mg/m2) were associated with increased preimplantation loss in rats.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Trovafloxacin mesylate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Photosensitivity Potential\nIn a study of the skin response to ultraviolet and visible radiation conducted in 48 healthy volunteers (12 per group), the minimum erythematous dose (MED) was measured for ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, trovafloxacin and placebo before and after drug administration for 5 days. In this study, trovafloxacin (200 mg q.d.) was shown to have a lower potential for producing delayed photosensitivity skin reactions than ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.) or lomefloxacin (400 mg q.d.), although greater than placebo.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Intravenous\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Trovafloxacin mesylate Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Trovafloxacin mesylate and IV administrations.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\nTrovafloxacin has a low order of acute toxicity. The minimum lethal oral dose in mice and rats was 2000 mg/kg or greater. The minimum lethal I.V. dose for the prodrug, alatrofloxacin, was 50–125 mg/kg for mice and greater than 75 mg/kg for rats. Clinical signs observed included decreased activity and respiration, ataxia, ptosis, tremors and convulsions.\nIn the event of acute oral overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. The patient should be carefully observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment. Adequate hydration should be maintained. Trovafloxacin is not efficiently removed from the body by hemodialysis.\n\n【29】 ## Mechanism of Action\nTrovafloxacin is a fluoronaphthyridone related to the fluoroquinolones with in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic, and anaerobic microorganisms. The bactericidal action of trovafloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. Mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including trovafloxacin is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Therefore, fluoroquinolones may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics. There is no cross-resistance between trovafloxacin and the mentioned classes of antibiotics. The overall results obtained from in vitro synergy studies, testing combinations of trovafloxacin with beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, indicate that synergy is strain specific and not commonly encountered. This agrees with results obtained previously with other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to trovafloxacin in vitro develops slowly via multiple-step mutation in a manner similar to other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to trovafloxacin in vitro occurs at a general frequency of between 1×10-7 to 10-10. Although cross-resistance has been observed between trovafloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to trovafloxacin.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\nThe chemical structure is:\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Trovafloxacin mesylate Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAfter intravenous administration, alatrofloxacin is rapidly converted to trovafloxacin. Plasma concentrations of alatrofloxacin are below quantifiable levels within 5 to 10 minutes of completion of a 1 hour infusion.\nTrovafloxacin is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 88%. For comparable dosages, no dosage adjustment is necessary when switching from parenteral to oral administration.\nMean trovafloxacin serum concentrations determined following 1 hour intravenous infusions of alatrofloxacin at daily doses of 200 mg (trovafloxacin equivalents) to healthy male volunteers and following daily oral administration of 200 mg trovafloxacin for 7 days to six male and six female healthy young volunteers.\nThe mean pharmacokinetic parameters (±SD) of trovafloxacin after single and multiple 100 mg and 200 mg oral doses and 1 hour intravenous infusions of alatrofloxacin in doses of 200 and 300 mg (trovafloxacin equivalents) appear in the chart below.\nSerum concentrations of trovafloxacin are dose proportional after oral administration of trovafloxacin in the dose range of 30 to 1000 mg or after intravenous administration of alatrofloxacin in the dose range of 30 to 400 mg (trovafloxacin equivalents). Steady state concentrations are achieved by the third daily oral or intravenous dose of trovafloxacin with an accumulation factor of approximately 1.3 times the single dose concentrations.\nOral absorption of trovafloxacin is not altered by concomitant food intake; therefore, it can be administered without regard to food.\nThe systemic exposure to trovafloxacin (AUC0–∞) administered as crushed tablets via nasogastric tube into the stomach was identical to that of orally administered intact tablets. Administration of concurrent enteral feeding solutions had no effect on the absorption of trovafloxacin given via nasogastric tube into the stomach. When trovafloxacin was administered as crushed tablets into the duodenum via nasogastric tube, the AUC0–∞ and peak serum concentration (Cmax) were reduced by 30% relative to the orally administered intact tablets. Time to peak serum level (Tmax) was also decreased from 1.7 hrs to 1.1 hrs.\nTrovafloxacin is metabolized by conjugation (the role of cytochrome P450 oxidative metabolism of trovafloxacin is minimal). Thirteen percent of the administered dose appears in the urine in the form of the ester glucuronide and 9% appears in the feces as the N-acetyl metabolite (2.5% of the dose is found in the serum as the active N-acetyl metabolite). Other minor metabolites (diacid, sulfamate, hydroxycarboxylic acid) have been identified in both urine and feces in small amounts (<4% of the administered dose).\nApproximately 50% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged (43% in the feces and 6% in the urine).\n\n【33】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nLong term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of trovafloxacin or alatrofloxacin have not been conducted.\ntrovafloxacin mesylate did not shorten the time to development of UV-induced skin tumors in hairless albino (Skh-1) mice; thus, it was not photo co-carcinogenic in this model. These mice received oral trovafloxacin and concurrent irradiation with simulated sunlight 5 days per week for 40 weeks followed by a 12-week treatment-free observation period. The daily dose of UV radiation used in this study was approximately 30% of the minimal dose of UV radiation that would induce erythema in Caucasian humans. The median time to the development of skin tumors in the hairless mice (42–43 weeks) was similar in the vehicle control group and those given 10 or 30 mg/kg of trovafloxacin daily. At a dose level of 30 mg/kg/day, the mice had skin trovafloxacin concentrations of approximately 7 µg/g. Following multiple 200 mg daily doses of trovafloxacin, the amount in human skin is estimated to be about 3 µg/g, based upon plasma concentrations measured at this dose level.\nTrovafloxacin was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell gene mutation assay and it was not clastogenic in mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes or mouse bone marrow cells. A mouse micronucleus test conducted with alatrofloxacin was also negative. The positive response observed in the E. coli bacterial mutagenicity assay may be due to the inhibition of DNA gyrase by trovafloxacin.\n- Quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals.\n- Arthropathy and chondrodysplasia were observed in immature animals given trovafloxacin.\n- At doses from 10 to 15 times the human dose based on mg/kg or approximately 3 to 5 times based on mg/m2, trovafloxacin has been shown to cause arthropathy in immature rats and dogs. In addition, these drugs are associated with an increased incidence of chondrodysplasia in rats compared to controls. There is no evidence of arthropathies in fully mature rats and dogs at doses from 40 or 10 times the human dose based on mg/kg or approximately 5 times based on mg/m2 for a 6 month exposure period.\n- Unlike some other members of the quinolone class, crystalluria and ocular toxicity were not observed in chronic safety studies with rats or dogs with either trovafloxacin or its prodrug, alatrofloxacin.\n- Quinolones have been reported to have proconvulsant activity that is exacerbated with concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Neither trovafloxacin administered orally at 500 mg/kg, nor alatrofloxacin administered intravenously at 75 mg/kg, showed an increase in measures of seizure activity in mice at doses when used in combination with the active metabolite of the NSAID, fenbufen.\n- As with other members of the quinolone class, trovafloxacin at doses 5 to 10 times the human dose based on mg/kg or 1 to 5 times the human dose based on mg/m2 produces testicular degeneration in rats and dogs dosed for 6 months.\n\n【34】 #Clinical Studies\nAdult patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia, requiring hospitalization and initial intravenous therapy, participated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy trials. The first trial compared intravenous alatrofloxacin (200 mg once daily for 2 to 7 days) followed by oral trovafloxacin (200 mg once daily) for a total of 7 to 14 days of therapy to intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg BID) plus ampicillin (500 mg QID) for 2 to 7 days followed by oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID) plus amoxicillin (500 mg TID) for a total of 7 to 14 days of therapy. The second study compared intravenous alatrofloxacin (200 mg once daily for 2 to 7 days) followed by oral trovafloxacin (200 mg once daily) for a total of 7 to 14 days of therapy to intravenous ceftriaxone (1000 mg once daily for 2 to 7 days) followed by oral cefpodoxime (400 mg BID) for 7 to 14 days of total therapy with optional blinded erythromycin added to the ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime arm if an atypical pneumonia was suspected.\nThe clinical success rate (cure + improvement with no need for further antibiotic therapy) at the End of Treatment was 90% (311/346) and 90% (325/363) for trovafloxacin mesylate and the comparator agents, respectively. The clinical success rate at the End of Study (Day 30) was 86% (256/299) and 85% (283/334) for trovafloxacin mesylate and the comparator agents, respectively. All cause mortality (Day 1–35) was 2.45% (10/408) on trovafloxacin mesylate and 5.45% (23/422) on the comparator agents.\nThe following outcomes are the clinical success rates for the clinically evaluable patient groups by pathogen in these two studies:\nOf the above patients with clinical failure at end of treatment or study, only one alatrofloxacin patient (H. influenzae + S. pneumoniae) and one ceftriaxone + erythromycin patient (Legionella) had a microbiologically confirmed persistent pathogen at the time of failure with no emergence of resistance in either study.\nPatients hospitalized with clinically documented, complicated intra-abdominal infections, including post-surgical infections, participated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing intravenous alatrofloxacin (300 mg once daily) followed by oral trovafloxacin (200 mg once daily) to intravenous imipenem/cilastatin (1g q8h) followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (500 mg TID) for a maximum of 14 days of therapy. The clinical success rate (cure + improvement) at the End of Treatment was 88% (136/155) and 86% (122/142) for alatrofloxacin→trovafloxacin and imipenem/cilastatin→amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, respectively. The clinical success rate at the End of Study (Day 30) was 83% (129/156) and 84% (127/152) for alatrofloxacin→trovafloxacin and imipenem/cilastatin→amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, respectively.\n\n【35】 #How Supplied\n- Trovafloxacin mesylate 100 mg tablets\n\n【36】 - Trovafloxacin injection 5 mg/mL, 40 mL, 200 mg\n\n【37】 ## Storage\n- Trovafloxacin mesylate Tablets should be stored at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)\n\n【38】 #Patient Counseling Information\nPatients should be advised:\n- to discontinue therapy and to inform their physician immediately if they develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction including fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stool.\n- that trovafloxacin mesylate Tablets may be taken without regard to meals;\n- that vitamins or minerals containing iron, aluminum- or magnesium-base antacids, antacids containing citric acid buffered with sodium citrate, or sucralfate or Videx, (Didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution, should be taken at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking trovafloxacin mesylate tablets;\n\n【39】 #Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Trovafloxacin mesylate interaction has not been established.

Common adverse reactions include Bladder pain, Dysuria, Hematuria, Spasm of bladder.\n\n【2】 ### Indications\n- Cysview is an optical imaging agent indicated for use in the cystoscopic detection of non-muscle invasive papillary cancer of the bladder among patients suspected or known to have lesion(s) on the basis of a prior cystoscopy. Cysview is used with the Karl Storz D-Light C Photodynamic Diagnostic (PDD) system to perform cystoscopy with the blue light setting (Mode 2) as an adjunct to the white light setting (Mode 1).\n- Cysview is not:\n- a replacement for random bladder biopsies or other procedures used in the detection of bladder cancer for repetitive use. The potential risks associated with repetitive exposure, including sensitization and adverse effects of blue light have not been evaluated\n\n【3】 ### Dosage\n- The recommended dose for adults is 50 mL of reconstituted solution of Cysview, instilled into the bladder via a urinary catheter.\n- Cysview is supplied as a kit containing two vials: a clear glass vial labeled as Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride) for Intravesical Solution, containing 100 mg hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride as a powder, and a vial labeled as DILUENT for Cysview, containing 50 mL of the diluent in a polypropylene vial.\n- Perform all steps under aseptic conditions. Use gloves during the reconstitution procedure; skin exposure to hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride may increase the risk for sensitization to the drug.\n- Use a 50 mL syringe with a Luer Lock tip throughout the reconstitution procedure to ensure that the correct concentration (2mg/mL) of the drug is obtained and that a stable syringe-catheter connection is made for the bladder instillation of Cysview.\n- For bladder instillation of the solution of Cysview, use straight, or intermittent, urethral catheters with a proximal funnel opening that will accommodate the Luer Lock adapter. Use only catheters made of vinyl (uncoated or coated with hydrogel), latex (amber or red), and silicone to instill the reconstituted Cysview. Do not use catheters coated or embedded with silver or antibiotics. In-dwelling bladder catheters (Foley catheters) may be used if the catheters are inserted shortly prior to Cysview administration and are removed following the Cysview instillation.\n- Use the following steps for bladder instillation of Cysview:\n- Avoid skin contact with Cysview. If skin does come in contact with Cysview, wash immediately with soap and water and dry off. After voiding the bladder of Cysview, routinely wash the patient's perineal skin region with soap and water and dry.\n- Training and proficiency in cystoscopic procedures are essential prior to the use of Cysview. Carefully review the instruction manuals provided with the Karl Storz D-Light C Photodynamic Diagnosis (PDD) System. For additional training in the use of the PDD System, contact the manufacturer's representative.\n- Empty the patient's bladder and then fill the bladder with a clear fluid (standard bladder irrigation fluid) in order to distend the bladder wall for cystoscopic visibility. Ensure adequate irrigation during examination of the bladder; blood, urine or floating particles in the bladder may interfere with visualization under both white light and blue light.\n- a red fluorescence is expected at the bladder outlet and the prostatic urethra; this fluorescence occurs in normal tissue and is usually less intense and more diffuse than the bladder mucosal fluorescence associated with malignant lesions.\n- tangential light may give false fluorescence. To help avoid false fluorescence, hold the endoscope perpendicular and close to the bladder wall with the bladder distended.\n- false positive fluorescence may result from scope trauma from a previous cystoscopic examination and/or bladder inflammation.\nmalignant lesions may not fluoresce following Cysview administration, particularly if the lesions are coated with necrotic tissue. Blue light may fail to detect T2 tumors which have a tendency to be necrotic on the surface, and necrotic cells generally do not fluoresce.\n- when performing the blue light cystocopy, avoid prolonged blue light exposure. Studies have not evaluated the potential for adverse effects from blue light. In the controlled clinical trial, the cumulative blue light exposure from bladder mapping did not exceed 12 minutes and checking for complete tumor resection under blue light did not exceed 8 minutes for any patient.\n- Perform biopsy and/or resection of suspicious lesions by transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) only after completing white and blue light cystoscopic examinations with bladder mapping. Using standard cystoscopic practices, obtain biopsies of abnormal areas identified during either white or blue light examination and perform resections. Always check for the completeness of the resections under both white light and blue light before finalizing the TURB procedure.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Hexaminolevulinate in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Hexaminolevulinate in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nsafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Hexaminolevulinate in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Hexaminolevulinate in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- Cysview is contraindicated in patients with:\n- porphyria - gross hematuria - BCG immunotherapy or intravesical chemotherapy within the past 90 days\n- known hypersensitivity to hexaminolevulinate or any derivative of aminolevulinic acid\n\n【10】 - Anaphylaxis, including anaphylactoid shock, has been reported following administration of Cysview. Prior to and during use of the Cysview, have trained personnel and therapies available for the treatment of anaphylaxis. The safety of repetitive Cysview exposures has not been evaluated.\n- Cysview may fail to detect some bladder tumors, including malignant lesions. Cysview is not a replacement for random biopsies or any other procedure usually performed in the cystoscopic evaluation for cancer. In the controlled clinical trial, Cysview failed to detect 10% of lesions confirmed as malignant within the study drug group. Do not perform cystoscopy with blue light alone as malignant lesions can be missed unless the bladder is initially examined under white light.\n- The presence of urine and/or blood within the bladder may interfere with the detection of tissue fluorescence. To enhance the diagnostic utility of Cysview with the Karl Storz D-Light C PDD System:\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Anaphylaxis has been reported following exposure to Cysview.\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- In six clinical trials, safety data were obtained from 1,324 patients, aged 32 to 96 years with a median age of 69 years, all primarily Caucasian and approximately 75% male. All patients were evaluated after a single instillation of 50 mL solution of Cysview. Of these patients, 161 (12.2%) patients reported at least one adverse reaction. The most common adverse reaction was bladder spasm (reported in 2.2% of the patients) followed by dysuria, hematuria, and bladder pain. No patients experienced anaphylaxis. In the controlled clinical study, adverse reactions were similar in nature and rate between the study drug group and the control group\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Anaphylactoid shock, hypersensitivity reactions, bladder pain, cystitis and abnormal urinalysis have been reported during postmarketing use of Cysview.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- No specific drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adequate reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals have not been performed. Cysview should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Hexaminolevulinate in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Hexaminolevulinate during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether hexaminolevulinate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, exercise caution when Cysview is administered to nursing mothers.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nOf 1823 subjects in clinical studies of Cysview, 67% were 65 years and over while 34% were 75 years and over. No clinically important differences in safety or efficacy have been observed between older and younger patients in the controlled study.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Hexaminolevulinate with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Hexaminolevulinate with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Hexaminolevulinate in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Hexaminolevulinate in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Hexaminolevulinate in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Hexaminolevulinate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Intravesical\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Hexaminolevulinate in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Hexaminolevulinate in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\n- No adverse events were reported in a dose-finding study conducted among patients whose bladders were instilled with twice the recommended concentration (dose) of solution of Cysview.\n\n【29】 #Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Hexaminolevulinate Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Cysview is an ester of the heme precursor, aminolevulinic acid. After bladder instillation, Cysview enters the bladder mucosa and is proposed to enter the intracellular space of mucosal cells where it is used as a precursor in the formation of the photoactive intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and other photoactive porphyrins (PAPs). PpIX and PAPs are reported to accumulate preferentially in neoplastic cells as compared to normal urothelium, partly due to altered enzymatic activity in the neoplastic cells. After excitation with light at wavelengths between 360 and 450 nm, PpIX and other PAPs return to a lower energy level by fluorescing, which can be detected and used for cystoscopic detection of lesions. The fluorescence from tumor tissue appears bright red and demarcated, whereas the background normal tissue appears dark blue. Similar processes may occur in inflamed cells.\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- Cysview contains hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride, an optical imaging drug that in solution form is instilled intravesically for use with photodynamic blue light cystoscopy as an adjunct to white light cystoscopy.\n- The chemical formula for hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride is C11H21NO3∙HCl. Its molecular weight is 251.76 and it has the following structural formula:\n- Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride) for Intravesical Solution is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, freeze-dried, white to off-white or pale yellow, powder containing 100 mg of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (equivalent of 85 mg of hexaminolevulinate) in a 10 mL clear glass vials. The DILUENT for Cysview is a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution (pH 6) containing 0.61 mg/ mL disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.58 mg/mL of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 7.02 mg/mL of sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and water for injection. It is a clear, colorless solution, free from visible particles, and is provided in a 50 mL polypropylene vial.\n- The reconstituted solution of Cysview contains 2 mg/ml of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride and is colorless to pale yellow. It is free from visible particles and has a pH between 5.7 and 6.2.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In vitro studies have shown increased porphyrin fluorescence in normal urothelium after exposure to Cysview. In the human bladder, a greater accumulation of porphyrins is proposed in neoplastic or inflamed cells, compared to normal urothelium. After bladder instillation of Cysview for approximately 1 hour and subsequent illumination with blue light at wavelengths 360 – 450 nm, the porphyrins will fluoresce red\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- After bladder instillation of -labeled Cysview (100 mg) for approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers, absolute bioavailability of Cysview was 7% (90% confidence interval : 5%-10%). The -labeled substance(s) showed biphasic elimination, with an initial elimination half-life of 39 minutes, followed by a terminal half-life of approximately 76 hours. Whole blood analysis showed no evidence of significant binding of Cysview to erythrocytes. An in vitro study showed that Cysview underwent rapid metabolism in human blood.\n\n【34】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- No studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride.\n- Hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride was not mutagenic in in vitro reverse mutation tests in bacteria, or in chromosome aberration tests in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was negative in an in vivo micronucleus test in mice after intravenous injection of doses up to 45 mg/kg in the absence of light activation. Adequate studies have not been performed to evaluate the genetic toxicity of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride in the presence of light activation.\n- Adequate reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effects of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride on fertility.\n- Dose dependent neurological effects such as tremor, increased motor activity, and increased startle and touch escape responses were observed immediately after dosing at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg (24 times human systemic exposure based on the body surface area, using 10% as the upper level of 90% confidence interval of bioavailability) in a single dose rat study. The animals recovered to normal status by 60 min after dosing. Adverse neurological effects were also noted in other single or repeat dose toxicity studies.\n- Hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride had moderate to strong potential to cause skin sensitization based on a local lymph node assay in mouse.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\n- The safety and efficacy of Cysview when used with photodynamic cystoscopy were studied in a prospective, multicenter, controlled clinical trial. Adult patients with known or suspected bladder cancer were randomized to either white light (WL) cystoscopy (control group, n = 384) or WL followed by blue light (BL) cystoscopy (study drug group, n = 395). Only the study drug group patients received Cysview by bladder instillation prior to cystoscopy. After bladder evacuation of Cysview, bladder lesion mapping was performed initially using the Karl Storz PDD system in the WL mode followed by lesion mapping in the BL mode. Control group patients underwent only WL cystoscopy with lesion mapping. The average age of the randomized patients was 69 years (range 24 to 96); 78% were male and 94% were Caucasian. All patients had previously undergone cystoscopy.\n- Diagnostic efficacy assessed the number of patients within the study drug group who had at least one additional Ta or T1 bladder cancer detected only by BL; the proportion of these patients was compared to a proposed threshold proportion of 10%. Within the study drug group, 286 patients had at least one Ta and/or T1 lesion, including 47 patients who had at least one of the lesions detected only by BL\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- Cysview is supplied as a kit labeled, Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride) Kit for Intravesical Solution, 100 mg. The kit contains:\n\n【37】 ## Storage\n- Store Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride) Kit for Intravesical Solution at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); excursions are permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). - Do not use beyond the expiry date printed on the carton.\n- Use the solution of Cysview shortly after reconstitution. If unable to use within this time period, the reconstituted solution can be stored under refrigeration at 2°-8°C (36°-46°F) for up to 2 hours in the 50 mL labeled syringe.\n\n【38】 #Patient Counseling Information\nAsk patients if they have:\n- a diagnosis or a family history of porphyria - allergy to aminolevulinic acid or prior exposure to Cysview\n- gross hematuria - had BCG immunotherapy or chemotherapy within the bladder.\n- Inform patients that Cysview should be retained in the bladder for 1 hour from instillation of Cysview to the start of the cystoscopic procedure. If the patient cannot hold Cysview for 1 hour, but needs to void and expel Cysview from the bladder, he or she may void and should then inform a health care professional\n\n【39】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Hexaminolevulinate interaction has not been established. Talk to your doctor about the effects of taking alcohol with this medication.\n\n【40】 #Brand Names\n- CYSVIEW\n\n【41】 #Look-Alike Drug Names\nThere is limited information regarding the look alike drug names.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-28 00:26:18"}

Longevity claims differ from existing verified supercentenarian cases, and also from longevity myths in that either some evidence exists, the case has not been proven false, and/or the claim was not constructed as a result of a longevity myth, which tends to focus on the \"village elder\" concept, \"fountain of youth\" concept, nationalist mythology, racial mythology, patriarchal mythology, etc. One test of this is the idea, put forth by William Thoms in the 1870s, of the 100th birthday test: is there evidence of the person claiming to be age 100 some 10 or more years prior to their claim? This test does not prove a person's age (indeed, Susie Brunson passed this test, but later was shown to have exaggerated her age well before this time). However, this test does separate the typical pension-claim longevity exaggeration (which tends to run to about age 115 up to 125) and the \"myth of longevity\" claim, whereby a spontaneous claim is made that a certain village elder is \"150\" or \"167.\" E.g.: Bir Narayan Chaudhuri may have claimed to be 141 years old in 1998, but there was no evidence of a 100th birthday party 41 years earlier.\n\n【1】 #Problems with the documentation process\nIn the transitional period of record-keeping, records tend to exist for the wealthy and upper-middle classes, but are often spotty and non-existent for the poor. In the United States, birth registration did not begin in Mississippi until 1912 and was not universal until 1933. Hence, there is the problem of many cases whereby no actual birth record exists. Since some were recorded in the census, however, there may be obtainable evidence that tends to support the age claim. Sometimes, however, a single year may be off. In the case of Susie Gibson, for example, the family (and Susie herself) claimed her to be born on October 31, 1889, but no birth document has (yet) been located. The earliest record available, the 1900 census, lists her as born in October 1890. Hence, since the 1900 census is a proximate record (not written in 1890), it can be said that there is a near-certainty that Susie was at least 115, and it's still possible that she was in fact 116. In a similar, related case, inconsistent records suggested that Maggie Barnes was at least 115, but possibly a year older. Documentarians tend to 'err on the side of caution'. Thus, Ms. Barnes claimed to be 117, and was at least 115, but could have been 116.\nIn some cases a person may just miss the standards required for acceptance. For example, Rosa Williams of College Park, Georgia died in January 2001, allegedly born in May 1886. The 1910 census listed her as 22, suggesting she was born in May 1887 or May 1888. Hence, we cannot be certain of her age, but some evidence exists to support the claim. This type of case is said to be \"partially validated\", although she was at least 112, so a supercentenarian regardless.\n\n【2】 #Lists of longevity claims\nThe below lists are meant to show the present and past range of longevity claims, in the grey area between verified and impossible. The lists should be viewed as a spectrum, with the lower ages being more likely to be true and the higher ages less likely to be true.\nThese lists also serve the purpose of showing the wide range of distribution of extreme claims, which refutes the contention that such claims are particular to only certain \"longevity villages\". The lists also help to dispel the notion that one claimant should be accepted (without records) while ignoring all the other claims out there (which would also have to be accepted if records weren't required). Finally, because a few of the claims may be true but records do not exist or have not been found, the lists serve the third purpose of categorizing those grey area cases (such as the one of Maria Strelnikova of Russia) that could be true, but have not (yet) been proven as such.\n\n【3】 ## Partially-validated cases (presumed to be living)\nThese cases have some evidence of validity, but do not meet the criteria for full validation. F.e.: the person may be listed in the 1930 census or Social Security Death Index (in the U.S.).\n\n【4】 ## Recent claims with no records (presumed to be living)\nThese cases have no publicly available early-life records to support them, but have been made in the press. At the very least, the person should have a claimed year, month and day of birth to be listed here. Claims that don't should be listed in the article about longevity myths. Only claims of at least 113 are included here. Note: the current oldest verified living person is Edna Parker from the United States.\n\n【5】 ## Longevity claims of the past (116+)\nNote: only claims with a claimed birth and death date, and an age between 115 and 130 are included. For this article, claims above 130 are considered to be longevity myths. Disproven claims should also be listed in longevity myths. This list here represents the 'grey' area of cases on the cusp of believability.\n\n【6】 #False and exaggerated claims (living)\nThese are claims that have been shown to be exaggerated:\n- Rosa Brown of Pleasantville, New Jersey alleged to be born Mar 15, 1890; now said born in 1901", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:30:08"}

Cushing's syndrome was first identified by Dr. Harvey Cushing (an American physician, surgeon, and endocrinologist) in 1932 as a polyglandular disorder. It was later named as Cushing's syndrome. Normally, cortisol is released from the adrenal gland in response to ACTH being released from the pituitary gland. Both Cushing's syndrome and Cushing's disease are characterized by elevated levels of cortisol in the blood, but the cause of elevated cortisol differs between the two. Cushing's disease specifically refers to a tumor in the pituitary gland that stimulates the excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal gland by releasing large amounts of ACTH. In Cushing's disease, ACTH levels do not respond to negative feedback from the high levels of cortisol. Cushing's disease is particularly common in females. Annually, there are around 2–5 new cases per million people worldwide. Common risk factors in the development of Cushing's disease are female gender and genetic factors. Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include  rapid weight gain, particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity), a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\", excessive sweating, insomnia, reduced libido, impotence, amenorrhea, infertility and psychological disturbances, ranging from euphoria to psychosis. Depression and anxiety. Cushing's syndrome may progress to develop amenorrhoea, infertility, and psychological disturbances. If left untreated, patients with Cushing's syndrome may progress to develop diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric complications. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease. When Cushing's is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level) or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offer equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, high cortisol would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late night levels of salivary cortisol are high in Cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may need to be ascertained. CT scan of the adrenal gland is performed to detect the presence of the adrenal adenoma and the cause of ectopic ACTH. CT scan is preferred over MRI in these cases. MRI of the pituitary gland is performed to detect the presence of the pituitary adenoma. The medications usually used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome are Pasireotide, Cabergoline, Ketoconazole, and Metyrapone. The choice of medical therapy should be individualized. It is guided by drug efficacy, side effects, individual patient factors, and cost. If an adrenal adenoma is identified it may be removed by either laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic pituitary adenoma should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients will require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with hydrocortisone or prednisolone is imperative.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nCushing's syndrome was first identified by Dr. Harvey Cushing (an American physician, surgeon, and endocrinologist) in 1932 as a polyglandular disorder. It was later named as Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nCushing's syndrome may be classified according to the source of cortisol into four subtypes; Endogenous, exogenous, familial Cushing's Syndrome, and pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nBoth the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are part of the brain. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal gland, where it stimulates the release of cortisol. Cortisol is secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland from a region called the zona fasciculata in response to ACTH. Elevated levels of cortisol exert negative feedback on the pituitary, which decreases the amount of ACTH released from the pituitary gland. Strictly, Cushing's syndrome refers to excess cortisol due to any etiology. One of the causes of Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland. The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low. Cushing's disease refers only to hypercortisolism secondary to excess production of ACTH from a corticotropic  adenoma. This causes the blood ACTH levels to be elevated along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because a tumor causes the pituitary to be unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, causing worsening of hypertension and  hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion).\n\n【5】 #Causes\nCushing’s syndrome occurs when the body is exposed to high levels of corticosteroids for a long period of time. Many people develop Cushing’s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids, (steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol) such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people may develop Cushing’s syndrome as a result of excessive cortisol production due to adrenal or extra-adrenal causes.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating (Disease name) from other Conditions\nCushing's syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases that cause hypertension, obesity, and hyperandrogenism, such as metabolic syndrome X and pseudo-Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nCushing's disease is particularly common in females. Annually, there are around 2–5 new cases per million people worldwide.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of Cushing's disease are female gender and genetic factors.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nCushing's disease may present initially as rapid weight gain, a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\", and insomnia. It may progress to amenorrhoea, infertility, and psychological disturbances. If left untreated, patients with Cushing's syndrome may develop diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric complications. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of Cushing's syndrome include  rapid weight gain, particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity), a round face also known as a \"moon face\", excessive sweating, insomnia, reduced libido, impotence, amenorrhea, infertility and psychological disturbances, ranging from euphoria to psychosis and may also include depression and anxiety.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\nPatients with Cushing's syndrome usually appear obese. Physical examination of patients with Cushing's syndrome is remarkable for moon-like faces, easy bruising, purple skin stria, and hirsutism.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\nWhen Cushing's disease is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level) or a 24-hour urinary measurement of cortisol may be used for detection. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, high cortisol would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may also need to be ascertained.\n\n【14】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no electrocardiogram findings associated with Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【15】 ## Chest X Ray\nAnX-Ray may be helpful to identify the causes of ectopic ACTH in Cushing's syndrome such as lung carcinoma, bronchial carcinoid, and thymic carcinoid.\n\n【16】 ## CT\nCT scan of the adrenal gland is performed to detect the presence of the adrenal adenoma and the cause of ectopic ACTH. CT scan is preferred over MRI in these cases.\n\n【17】 ## MRI\nMRI of the pituitary gland is performed to detect the presence of the pituitary adenoma.\n\n【18】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\nThere are no electrocardiography or ultrasound findings associated with Cushing's disease.\n\n【19】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nScintigraphy of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary.\n\n【20】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe medications usually used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome are pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, and metyrapone. The choice of medical therapy should be individualized. It is guided by drug efficacy, side effects, individual patient factors, and cost.\n\n【21】 ## Surgery\nIf an adrenal adenoma is identified, it may be removed by either laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy. An ACTH-secreting corticotropic pituitary adenoma should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients will require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. If both adrenals are removed, replacement with hydrocortisone or prednisolone is imperative.\n\n【22】 ## Primary prevention\nThere are no primary preventive measures available for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【23】 ## Secondary prevention\nThere are no secondary preventive measures available for Cushing's syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:21:46"}

No meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily or the supratherapeutic dose of 350 mg once daily.\n\n【2】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of simeprevir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in adult HCV-infected subjects. Plasma Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased more than dose-proportionally after multiple doses between 75 mg and 200 mg once daily, with accumulation occurring following repeated dosing. Steady-state was reached after 7 days of once daily dosing. Plasma exposure (AUC) of simeprevir in HCV-infected subjects was about 2- to 3-fold higher compared to that observed in HCV-uninfected subjects. Plasma Cmax and AUC of simeprevir were similar during co-administration of simeprevir with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin compared with administration of simeprevir alone. In HCV-infected subjects, the mean steady-state predose plasma concentration was 1936 ng/mL (standard deviation: 2640) and the mean steady-state AUC24 was 57469 ng.h/mL (standard deviation: 63571).\n\n【3】 ### Absorption\nSimeprevir is orally bioavailable. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically achieved between 4 to 6 hours post dose.\nIn vitro studies with human Caco-2 cells indicated that simeprevir is a substrate of P-gp.\n\n【4】 ### Effects of Food on Oral Absorption\nAdministration of simeprevir with food to healthy subjects increased the relative bioavailability (AUC) by 61% and 69% after a high-fat, high-caloric (928 kcal) and normal-caloric (533 kcal) breakfast, respectively, and delayed the absorption by 1 hour and 1.5 hours, respectively.\n\n【5】 ### Distribution\nSimeprevir is extensively bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99.9%), primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, alfa 1-acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\nIn animals, simeprevir is extensively distributed to gut and liver (liver:blood ratio of 29:1 in rat) tissues. In vitro data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations indicate that hepatic uptake in humans is mediated by OATP1B1/3.\n\n【6】 ### Metabolism\nSimeprevir is metabolized in the liver. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes indicated that simeprevir primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism by the hepatic CYP3A system. Involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 cannot be excluded. Co-administration of OLYSIO with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma exposure of simeprevir, and co-administration with moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of simeprevir .\nFollowing a single oral administration of 200 mg 14C-simeprevir to healthy subjects, the majority of the radioactivity in plasma (mean: 83%) was accounted for by unchanged drug and a small part of the radioactivity in plasma was related to metabolites (none being major metabolites). Metabolites identified in feces were formed via oxidation at the macrocyclic moiety or aromatic moiety or both and by O-demethylation followed by oxidation.\n\n【7】 ### Elimination\nElimination of simeprevir occurs via biliary excretion. Renal clearance plays an insignificant role in its elimination. Following a single oral administration of 200 mg 14C-simeprevir to healthy subjects, on average 91% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. Less than 1% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged simeprevir in feces accounted for on average 31% of the administered dose.\nThe terminal elimination half-life of simeprevir was 10 to 13 hours in HCV-uninfected subjects and 41 hours in HCV-infected subjects receiving 200 mg simeprevir.\n\n【8】 ### Specific Populations\nThere is limited data on the use of OLYSIO in patients aged 65 years and older. Age (18–73 years) had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of HCV-infected subjects treated with OLYSIO. No dose adjustment of OLYSIO is required in geriatric patients .\nRenal elimination of simeprevir is negligible. Compared to HCV-uninfected subjects with normal renal function (classified using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease  eGFR formula; eGFR greater than or equal to 80 mL/min) the mean steady-state AUC of simeprevir was 62% higher in HCV-uninfected subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min). Based on the observed and expected changes in simeprevir exposure, no dose adjustment of OLYSIO is needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of OLYSIO have not been studied in HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, including patients requiring dialysis .\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of mild or moderate renally impaired HCV-infected subjects treated with OLYSIO 150 mg once daily, creatinine clearance was not found to influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of simeprevir. It is therefore not expected that renal impairment will have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to simeprevir.\nAs simeprevir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis.\n\n【9】 Simeprevir is primarily metabolized by the liver. Compared to HCV-uninfected subjects with normal hepatic function, the mean steady-state AUC of simeprevir was 2.4-fold higher in HCV-uninfected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and 5.2-fold higher in HCV-uninfected subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). No dose adjustment of OLYSIO is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). The safety and efficacy of OLYSIO have not been studied in HCV-infected patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). In clinical trials, higher simeprevir exposures have been associated with increased frequency of adverse reactions, including rash and photosensitivity. No dose recommendation can be given for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). The potential risks and benefits of OLYSIO should be carefully considered prior to use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of HCV-infected subjects treated with OLYSIO, liver fibrosis stage did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir.\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, body weight or body mass index. These characteristics have no clinically meaningful relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of HCV-infected subjects treated with OLYSIO.\nBased on results from studies in HCV-uninfected subjects and HCV-infected subjects, simeprevir exposures are higher in Asians compared to Caucasians. In the Phase 3 trials, the mean simeprevir plasma exposure in Asian subjects (n=14) was 3.4-fold higher than in the pooled Phase 3 population. In clinical trials, higher simeprevir exposures have been associated with increased frequency of adverse reactions, including rash and photosensitivity. There are insufficient safety data to recommend an appropriate dose for patients of East Asian ancestry. The potential risks and benefits of OLYSIO should be carefully considered prior to use in patients of East Asian ancestry .\nPopulation pharmacokinetic estimates of exposure of simeprevir were comparable between Caucasian and Black/African American HCV-infected subjects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:59:02"}

Drug groups known as MAOIs, tricyclics and SSRIs are particularly associated with the term. These medications are now amongst the drugs most commonly prescribed by psychiatrists and general practitioners, and their effectiveness and adverse effects are the subject of many studies and competing claims. An example of an herbal remedy that is an antidepressant is St John's Wort. Nutrients that are antidepressants include phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, and choline.\nMost antidepressants have a delayed onset of action and are usually taken over the course of weeks, months or years. They are generally considered distinct from stimulants, and drugs used for an immediate euphoric effect only are not generally considered antidepressants. Despite the name, antidepressants are often used in the treatment of other conditions, including anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders and chronic pain. Some have also become known as lifestyle drugs or \"mood brighteners\". Other medications not known as antidepressants, including antipsychotics in low doses and benzodiazepines, are also widely used to manage depression.\nThe term antidepressant is sometimes applied to any therapy (e.g. psychotherapy, electro-convulsive therapy, acupuncture) or process (e.g. sleep disruption, increased light levels, regular exercise) found to improve clinically depressed mood. An inert placebo tends to have a significant antidepressant effect, so establishing something as an antidepressant in a clinical trial involves demonstrating a significant additional effect.\n\n【2】 #History\nOpium and St John's Wort (as a \"nerve tonic\") had long been used to alleviate depression (amongst many other things), but iproniazid was the first synthetic chemical compound generally accepted as an antidepressant. The chemical from which it was derived, isoniazid was independently recognized as having clinically significant effects on depression, in 1952 by Jean-Francois Buisson in France and Max Lurie in the United States, after it had come into widespread use as a treatment for tuberculosis.\nIproniazid was then observed to have a greater \"psychostimulant\" effect and to inhibit the enzyme Monoamine Oxidase. Nathan Kline and colleagues conducted the first clinical trial to demonstrate a significant effect of iproniazid on depression in psychiatric patients. Kline approached Roche with what he called a \"psychic energizer\" and the first Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) was introduced as Marsilid. Sales grew massively in the following years, and others of the class were introduced by several drug companies, but adverse effects such as hypertension crisis related to food amines, and acute hepatic necrosis, curtailed their use.\nThe discovery that a tricyclic (\"three ringed\") compound had a significant antidepressant effect was also first made in the early 1950s, by Roland Kuhn in a Swiss psychiatric hospital. By that time antihistamine derivatives were coming in to use to treat surgical shock and then as psychiatric neuroleptics. Although, in 1955, reserpine was indicated to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics (literally \"to seize the neuron\") were developing for use as sedatives and antipsychotics.\nIn attempting to improve the effectiveness of one of them, chlorpromazine, in conjunction with the Geigy pharmaceutical company, Kuhn discovered that compound \"G 22355\" (manufactured and patented in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and Schinder) had a beneficial effect in patients with depression with mental and motor retardation. He first reported his findings on what he called a \"thymoleptic\" (literally \"taking hold of the emotions\", by contrast with neuroleptics, \"taking hold of the nerves\") in 1955/56 and they gradually became established, resulting in the marketing of the first tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, soon followed by variants.\nMost pharmacologists by the 1960s thought the main therapeutic action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake, but it was gradually observed that this action was associated with energizing and motor stimulating effects whilst some antidepressant compounds appeared to have differing effects through action on serotonin systems (notably proposed by Carlsson and Lindqvist  and Lapin and Oxenkrug ).\nResearchers began a process of rational drug design to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would 'selectively' (specifically) target these systems. The first such compound to be patented, in 1971, was zimelidine, whilst the first released clinically was indalpine. Fluoxetine (Prozac), FDA approved for commercial use in 1988, became the first blockbuster SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at Eli Lilly in the early 1970s by Bryan Molloy, Ray Fuller, David Wong and others.\nWhile it had fallen out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, the herb St John's Wort had become increasingly popular in Germany where Hypericum extracts eventually became licensed, packaged and prescribed by doctors. Small-scale efficacy trials were carried out from the 1970s and 1980s, and attention grew in the 1990s following a meta-analysis of these. It remained an over-the-counter drug (OTC) or supplement in most countries and research continued to investigate its neurotransmitter effects and active components, particularly hyperforin\nSSRIs became known as \"novel antidepressants\" along with other newer drugs such as SNRIs and NRIs with various different selective effects, such as venlafaxine, duloxetine, nefazodone and mirtazapine\n\n【3】 ## Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a family of antidepressants considered to be the current standard of drug treatment. It is thought that one cause of depression is an inadequate amount of serotonin, a chemical used in the brain to transmit signals between neurons. SSRIs are said to work by preventing the reuptake of serotonin by the presynaptic nerve, thus maintaining higher levels of 5-HT in the synapse. Recently, however, work by two researchers has called into question the link between serotonin deficiency and symptoms of depression, noting that the efficacy of SSRIs as treatment does not in itself prove the link. Recent research indicates that these drugs may interact with transcription factors known as \"clock genes\", which may be important for the addictive properties of drugs of abuse, and possibly in obesity.\nRecent randomized controlled trials in Archives of General Psychiatry showed that up to one-third of effects of SSRI Treatment can be seen in first week. Early effects also shown to have secondary effect of reducing absolute reduction in HDRS score by 50%. Even more recent studies, published by the Archives of General Psychiatry note that 25% of so-called clinical depression does not meet a disease criteria and should be considered to be ordinary sadness and adjustment to the difficulties in life.\nThis family of drugs includes fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), escitalopram (Lexapro, Esipram), citalopram (Celexa), and sertraline (Zoloft). These antidepressants typically have fewer adverse side effects than the tricyclics or the MAOIs, although such effects as drowsiness, dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, decreased appetite, and decreased ability to function sexually may occur. Some side effects may decrease as a person adjusts to the drug, but other side effects may be persistent. Though safer than first generation antidepressants, SSRI's may not work as often, suggesting the role of norepinephrine.\n\n【4】 ## Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\nSerotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are a newer form of antidepressant that works on both norepinephrine and 5-HT. They typically have similar side effects to the SSRIs, although there may be a withdrawal syndrome on discontinuation that may necessitate dosage tapering.\n\n【5】 ## Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs)\nNoradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs) form a newer class of antidepressants which purportedly work to increase norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors while at the same time minimizing serotonin related side-effects by blocking certain serotonin receptors. The only example of this class in clinical use is mirtazapine (Avanza, Zispin, Remeron).\n\n【6】 ## Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors (NRIs)\nNorepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) such as reboxetine (Edronax) act via norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline). NRIs are thought to have a positive effect on concentration and motivation in particular, though they have been known to increase aggression.\n\n【7】 ## Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors\nNorepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors such as bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban) inhibit the neuronal reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).\n\n【8】 ## Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\nTricyclic antidepressants are the oldest and include such medications as amitriptyline and desipramine. Tricyclics block the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin. They are used less commonly now due to the development of more selective and safer drugs. Several side effects include increased heart rate, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, and sexual dysfunction. Toxicity occurs at approximately ten times normal dosages. However, tricyclic antidepressants are still used because of their high potency, especially in severe cases of clinical depression.\n\n【9】 ## Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOIs)\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine (Nardil) may be used if other antidepressant medications are ineffective. Because there are potentially fatal interactions between this class of medication and certain foods (particularly those containing Tyramine), as well as certain drugs, classic MAOIs are rarely prescribed anymore. MAOIs work by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase which breaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they can have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects (as a result of inhibition of cytochrome P450 in the liver). A new generation of MAOIs has been introduced; moclobemide (Manerix), known as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), acts in a more short-lived and selective manner and does not require a special diet. Additionally, (selegiline) marketed as Emsam in a transdermal form is not a classic MAOI in that at moderate dosages it tends to effect MAO-B which does not require any dietary restrictions.\n\n【10】 ## Augmentor drugs\nSome antidepressants have been found to work more effectively in some patients when used in combination with another drug. Such \"augmentor\" drugs include tryptophan (Tryptan) and buspirone (Buspar).\nTranquillizers and sedatives, typically the benzodiazepines, may be prescribed to ease anxiety and promote sleep. Because of their high potential for fostering dependence, these medications are intended only for short-term or occasional use. Medications often are used not for their primary function but to exploit what are normally side effects. Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is designed primarily to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but a frequently reported side-effect is somnolence. Therefore, this drug can be used in place of an antianxiety agent such as clonazepam (Klonopin, Rivotril).\nAntipsychotics such as risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and Quetiapine (Seroquel) are prescribed as mood stabilizers and are also effective in treating anxiety. Their use as mood stabilizers is a recent phenomenon and is controversial with some patients. Antipsychotics (typical or atypical) may also be prescribed in an attempt to augment an antidepressant, to make antidepressant blood concentration higher, or to relieve psychotic or paranoid symptoms often accompanying clinical depression. However, they may have serious side effects, particularly at high dosages, which may include blurred vision, muscle spasms, restlessness, tardive dyskinesia, and weight gain.\nAntidepressants by their nature behave similarly to psychostimulants. Antianxiety medications by their nature are depressants. Close medical supervision is critical to proper treatment if a patient presents with both illnesses because the medications tend to work against each other.\nPsycho-stimulants are sometimes added to an antidepressant regimen if the patient suffers from anhedonia, hypersomnia and/or excessive eating as well as low motivation. These symptoms which are common in atypical depression can be quickly resolved with the addition of low to moderate dosages of amphetamine or methylphenidate (brand names Adderall and Ritalin, respectively) as these chemicals enhance motivation and social behavior, as well as suppress appetite and sleep. These chemicals are also known to restore sex drive. Extreme caution must be used however with certain populations. Stimulants are known to trigger manic episodes in people suffering from bipolar disorder. They are also easily abused as they are effective substitutes for Methamphetamine when used recreationally. Close supervision of those with substance abuse disorders is urged. Emotionally labile patients should avoid stimulants, as they exacerbate mood shifting.\nLithium remains the standard treatment for bipolar disorder and is often used in conjunction with other medications, depending on whether mania or depression is being treated. Lithium's potential side effects include thirst, tremors, light-headedness, and nausea or diarrhea. Some of the anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), sodium valproate (Epilim), and lamotrigine (Lamictal), are also used as mood stabilizers, particularly in bipolar disorder.\n\n【11】 #Prescription trends\nIn the United Kingdom the use of antidepressants increased by 234% in the 10 years up to 2002. In the United States a 2005 independent report stated that 11% of women and 5% of men in the non-Insitutionalised population  now take antidepressants A 1998 survey found that 67% of patients diagnosed with depression were prescribed an antidepressant\nA 2002 survey found that about 3.5% of all people in France were being prescribed antidepressants, compared to 1.7% in 1992, often for conditions other than depression and often not in line with authorizations or guidelines Between 1996 and 2004 in British Columbia, antidepressant use increased from 3.4% to 7.2% of the population Data from the Netherlands indicated an increasing rate of prescriptions of SSRIs, and an increasing duration of treatment.\nSurveys indicate that antidepressant use, particularly of SSRIs, has increased rapidly in most developed countries, driven by an increased awareness of depression together with the availability and commercial promotion of new antidepressants. Antidepressants are also increasingly used worldwide for non-depressive patients as studies continue show the potential of immunomodulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in antidepressants.\nThe choice of particular antidepressant is reported to be based, in the absence of research evidence of differences in efficacy, on seeking to avoid certain side effects, and taking into account comorbid (co-occurring) psychiatric disorders, specific clinical symptoms and prior treatment history\nIt is also reported that, despite unequivocal evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between older and newer antidepressants, clinicians perceive the newer drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs, to be more effective than the older drugs (tricyclics and MAOIs). A survey in the UK found that male general physicians were more likely to prescribe antidepressants than female doctors.\n\n【12】 ## Most commonly prescribed antidepressants\nThe most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the US in 2006  were:\n- Escitalopram - of the SSRI class (e.g. Lexapro, Cipralex)\n- Sertraline - of the SSRI class (e.g. Zoloft, Lustral, Apo-Sertral, Asentra, Gladem, Serlift, Stimuloton)\n- Venlafaxine - of the SNRI class (e.g. Effexor XR, Effexor)\n- Bupropion - of the  NDRI classes (e.g. Wellbutrin XR, Zyban)\n- Duloxetine - of the SNRI class (e.g. Cymbalta)\nThe most commonly prescribed antidepressant in Germany is reported to be (concentrated extracts of) hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort). In the Netherlands, paroxetine, marketed as Seroxat among generic preparations, is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, citalopram and venlafaxine.\n\n【13】 #Mechanisms of action\nThe therapeutic effects of antidepressants are believed to be related to their effects on neurotransmitters. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) block the break-down of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin and norepinephrine) by inhibiting the enzymes which oxidize them, thus leaving higher levels still active in the brain (synaptic cleft).\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) prevent the reuptake of various neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) more specifically prevent the reuptake of serotonin (thereby increasing the level of active serotonin in synapses of the brain). Other novel antidepressants specifically affect serotonin and other neurotransmitters.\nA theory centered on neurotransmitter effects appears to be incomplete, however. Neurotransmitter levels are altered as soon as the antidepressant chemicals build up in the bloodstream, but effects on mood appear to occur several days or weeks later.\nOne explanation of this holds that the \"down-regulation\" of neurotransmitter receptors— an apparent consequence of excess signaling and a process that takes several weeks — is actually the mechanism responsible for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Another hypothesis is that antidepressants may have some longer-term effects due to the promotion of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, an effect found in mice Other animal research suggests that antidepressants can also affect the expression of genes in brain cells, by influencing \"clock genes\".\nNew research suggests that delayed onset of clinical effects from antidepressants indicates involvement of adaptive changes in antidepressant effects. Rodent studies have consistently shown upregulation of the 3, 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system induced by different types of chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment including serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and electroconvulsions. cAMP is synthesized from adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) by adenylyl cyclase and metabolized by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Data also suggest antidepressants to have the ability of modulating neural plasticity in longterm administration.\n\n【14】 ## Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation\nRecent studies show pro-inflammatory cytokine processes take place during depression, mania and bipolar disease, and is possible that symptoms manifest in these psychiatric illnesses are being attenuated by pharmacological affect of antidepressants on the immune system.\nStudies also show that the chronic secretion of stress hormones as a result of disease, including somatic infections or autoimmune syndromes may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters or other receptors in the brain by cell-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. SSRIs, SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants acting on serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), as well as TNF-alpha and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Antidepressants have also been shown to suppress TH1 upregulation.\nAntidepressants, specifically TCAs and dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibition by dual SNRIs (or SSRI-NRI combinations), have also shown analgesic properties additionally.\nThese studies warrant investigation for antidepressants for use in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric illness and that a psycho-neuroimmunological approach may be required for optimal pharmacotherapy. Future antidepressants may be made to specifically target the immune system by either blocking the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines or increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n\n【15】 #Therapeutic efficacy\nThere is a large amount of research evaluating the potential therapeutic effects of antidepressants, whether through efficacy studies under experimental conditions (including randomized clinical trials) or through studies of \"real world\" effectiveness. A sufficient response to a drug is often defined as at least a 50% reduction in self-reported or observed symptoms, with a partial response often defined as at least a 25% reduction. The term remission indicates a virtual elimination of depression symptoms, albeit with the risk of a recurrence of symptoms or complete relapse. Full remission or recovery signifies a full sustained return to a \"normal\" psychological state with full functioning.\n\n【16】 ## Review studies\nRecent clinical reviews include:\n- A comparison of the relative efficacy of different classes of antidepressants in different settings and in regard to different kinds of depression\n- An assessment of antidepressants compared with an \"active placebo\"\n- A meta-analysis of randomized trials of St John's Wort\n- A review of the use of antidepressants for childhood depression\n\n【17】 ## Clinical guidelines\nThe American Psychiatric Association 2000 Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder indicates that, if preferred by the patient, antidepressant medications may be provided as an initial primary treatment for mild major depressive disorder; antidepressant medications should be provided for moderate to severe major depressive disorder unless electroconvulsive therapy is planned; and a combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications or electroconvulsive therapy should be used for psychotic depression. It states that efficacy is generally comparable between classes and within classes and that the initial selection will largely be based on the anticipated side effects for an individual patient, patient preference, quantity and quality of clinical trial data regarding the medication, and its cost.\nThe UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor; that for moderate or severe depression an SSRI is more likely to be tolerated than a tricyclic; and that antidepressants for severe depression should be combined with a psychological treatment such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.\n\n【18】 ## Efficacy limitations and strategies\nBetween 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response. Even where there has been a robust response, significant continuing depression and dysfunction is common, with relapse rates 3 to 6 times higher in such cases. In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.\n\n【19】 ### \"Trial and error\" switching\nThe American Psychiatric Association 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.\nA recent meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug, with between 5% and 39% ending treatment due to adverse effects. The more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.\n\n【20】 ### Augmentation and combination\nFor a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines advise adding a different kind of pharmaceutical agent to the antidepressant. Studies suggest that most patients fail to achieve remission on a given antidepressant, and augmentation strategies used in clinical practice include the use of lithium and thyroid augmentation, but there is not a good evidence base for these practices or for more novel strategies such as the use of selective dopamine agonists, sex steroids, NRI's, glucocorticoid-specific agents, or the newer anticonvulsants\nA combination strategy involves adding one or more additional antidepressants, usually from different classes so as to have a diverse neurochemical effect. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.\n\n【21】 ### Long-term use\nThe therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of relapse. A recent meta-analysis of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a placebo. The American Psychiatric Association guidelines advise four to five months of continuation treatment on an antidepressant following the resolution of symptoms. For patients with a history of depressive episodes, the British Association for Psychopharmacology's 2000 Guidelines for Treating Depressive Disorders with Antidepressants advise remaining on an antidepressant for at least six months and as long as five years or indefinitely.\nWhether or not someone relapses after stopping an antidepressant does not appear to be related to the duration of prior treatment, however, and gradual loss of therapeutic benefit during the course also occurs. A strategy involving the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode, followed by psychotherapy in its residual phase, has been suggested by some studies.\n\n【22】 ## Medication failure\nApproximately 30% of patients have remission of depression with medications. For patients with inadequate response, either adding sustained-release bupropion(initially 200 mg per day then increase by 100 mg up to total of 400 mg per day) or buspirone (up to 60 mg per day) for augmentation as a second drug can cause remission in approximately 30% of patients, while switching medications can achieve remission in about 25% of patients.\n\n【23】 #Tolerance and dependence\nMost antidepressants, including the SSRIs and tricyclics, are known to produce tolerance (i.e. a patient receiving antidepressant therapy for some years will often have to increase the dose over time, or add other drugs, to receive the same therapeutic effect), and withdrawal (particularly if abrupt) may produce adverse effects, which can range from mild to extremely severe.\nAntidepressants do not seem to have all of the same addictive qualities as other substances such as nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, or other stimulants - in other words, while antidepressants may cause dependence and withdrawal they do not seem to cause uncontrollable urges to increase the dose due to euphoria or pleasure, and thus do not meet the strict definition of an addictive substance. However, antidepressants do meet the World Health Organisation definition of \"dependency-inducing\", and indeed the SSRIs are listed by the organisation as among the most strongly dependency-inducing substances in existence.\nIf an SSRI medication is suddenly discontinued, it may produce both somatic and psychological withdrawal symptoms, a phenomenon known as \"SSRI discontinuation syndrome\" . When the decision is made to stop taking antidepressants it is common practice to \"wean\" off of them by slowly decreasing the dose over a period of several weeks or months, although often this will reduce the severity of the discontinuation reaction, rather than prevent it. Most cases of discontinuation syndrome last between one and four weeks, though there are examples of patients (especially those who have used the drugs for longer periods of time, or at a higher dose) experiencing adverse effects such as impaired concentration, poor short-term memory, elevated anxiety and sexual dysfunction, for months or even years after discontinuation.\nIt is generally not a good idea to take antidepressants without a prescription. The selection of an antidepressant and dosage suitable for a certain case and a certain person is a lengthy and complicated process, requiring the knowledge of a professional. Certain antidepressants can initially make depression worse, can induce anxiety, or can make a patient aggressive, dysphoric or acutely suicidal. In certain cases, an antidepressant can induce a switch from depression to mania or hypomania, can accelerate and shorten a manic cycle (i.e. promote a rapid-cycling pattern), or can induce the development of psychosis (or just the re-activation of latent psychosis) in a patient with depression who was not psychotic before the antidepressant.\n\n【24】 #Side effects\nAntidepressants can often cause side effects, and an inability to tolerate these is the most common cause of discontinuing an otherwise working medication.\nSide effects of SSRIs:\nNausea, diarrhea, headaches. Sexual side effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of libido, failure to reach orgasm and erectile problems. Serotonin syndrome is also a worrying condition associated with the use of SSRIs\nFairly common side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, sexual problems, skin rash, and weight gain or loss.\nRare side effects of MAOIs like phenelzine (brand name: Nardil) and tranylcypromine (brand name: Parnate) include liver inflammation, heart attack, stroke, and seizures.Serotonin syndrome is a side effect of MAOIs and SSRIs when they are combined.\n\n【25】 ## General\nAlthough recent drugs may have fewer side effects, patients sometimes report severe side effects associated with their discontinuation, particularly with paroxetine and venlafaxine. Additionally, a certain percentage of patients do not respond to antidepressant drugs. Another advantage of some newer antidepressants is they can show effects within as few as five days, whereas most take four to six weeks to show a change in mood. However, some studies show that these medications might be even more likely to result in moderate to severe sexual dysfunction. However, there are medications in trials that appear to show an improved profile in regard to sexual dysfunction and other key side effects.\nMAO inhibitors can produce a potentially lethal hypertensive reaction if taken with foods that contain high levels of tyramine, such as mature cheese, cured meats or yeast extracts. Likewise, lethal reactions to both prescription and over the counter medications have occurred. Any patient currently undergoing therapy with an MAO inhibiting medication should be monitored closely by the prescribing physician and always consulted before taking an over the counter or prescribed medication. Such patients should also inform emergency room personnel and information should be kept with one's identification indicating the fact that the holder is on MAO inhibiting medications. Some doctors even suggest the use of a medical alert ID bracelet. Although the reactions in question are dramatic when they happen, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns are comparable to over-the-counter medications.\nAntidepressants should be used with great care, usually in conjunction with mood stabilisers, in the treatment of bipolar disorder, as they can exacerbate symptoms of mania. They have also been known to trigger mania or hypomania in some patients with bipolar disorder and in a small percentage of patients with depression. SSRIs are the antidepressants most frequently associated with this side effect.\nUse of antidepressants should be monitored by a psychiatrist, but in countries such as France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, primary care physicians are able to prescribe antidepressants without consulting a psychiatrist.\nIn particular, it has been noted that the most dangerous period for suicide in a patient with depression is immediately after treatment has commenced, as antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of depression such as psychomotor retardation or lack of motivation before mood starts to improve. Although this appears to be a paradox, studies indicate the suicidal ideation is a relatively common component of the initial phases of antidepressant therapy, and it may be even more prevalent in younger patients such as pre-adolescents and teenagers. It is strongly recommended that other family members and loved ones monitor the young patient's behavior, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy, for any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors.\nUntil the black box warnings on these drugs were issued by FDA as well as by agencies in other nations, side effects and alerting families to risk were largely ignored and downplayed by manufacturers and practitioners. This may have resulted in some deaths by suicide although direct proof for such a link is largely anecdotal. The higher incidence of suicide ideation reported in a number of studies has drawn attention and caution in how these drugs are used.\nPeople under the age of 24 who suffer from depression are warned that the use of antidepressants could increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Federal health officials unveiled Proposed changes to the labels on antidepressant drugs in December 2006 to warn people of the inherent danger.\n\n【26】 ## Sexual\nSexual dysfunction is a very common side effect, especially with SSRIs. Common sexual side effects include problems with libido (sexual desire), lack of interest in sex, and anorgasmia (trouble achieving orgasm).  Although usually reversible, these sexual side effects can, in rare cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn. This disorder is known as Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction.\nBupropion, a dual reuptake inhibitor (NE and DA), in many cases results in a moderately increased libido, due to increased dopamine activity. This effect is also seen with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, CNS stimulants and dopamine agonists, and is due to increases in testosterone production (due to inhibition of prolactin) and increased nitric oxide synthesis. Apomorphine, nefazodone and nitroglycerin have been shown to reverse some sexual dysfunction via increased nitric oxide activity. MAOIs are reported to have fewer negative effects on sexual function and libido, particularly moclobemide at a 1.9% rate of occurrence. Betanechol has been reported to reverse MAOI-induced sexual dysfunction via its cholinergic agonist properties (Gross 1982).\nIn order for the physician to select the appropriate response, the patient should provide the physician with information to distinguish between reduced libido (little or no desire for sex), reduced sexual function (impotence, vaginal dryness) and anorgasmia, as these have separate causes and prompt different treatment.\n\n【27】 ## Thymoanesthesia\nClosely related to sexual side effects is the phenomenon of emotional blunting, or mood anesthesia. Many users of SSRIs complain of apathy, lack of motivation, emotional numbness, feelings of detachment, and indifference to surroundings. They may describe this as a feeling of \"not caring about anything any more.\" All SSRIs, SNRIs, and serotonergic TCAs are liable to cause this effect to varying degrees, especially at higher dosages.\n\n【28】 ## REM Sleep\nIt is well recognized that virtually all major antidepressant drugs but trimipramine suppress REM sleep and it has, in fact, been proposed that the clinical efficacy of these drugs largely derives from their suppressant effects on REM sleep. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep. The MAOIs virtually completely abolish REM sleep, while the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40-85%) and sustained (30-50%) reductions in REM sleep. Abrupt discontinuation of MAOIs can cause a temporary phenomenon known as \"REM rebound\" in which the patient experiences extremely vivid dreams and nightmares.\n\n【29】 ## Weight Gain\nMany antidepressants in all categories are associated with weight gain usually in the range of 10-50 pounds but not uncommonly upwards of 100 pounds. The specific cause is unknown, but it is known that antidepressants are associated with increased cravings (usually for high fat carbohydrates), an inability to feel full despite ingestion of adequate calories, low energy levels and increased daytime sleepiness which can lead to overeating and a lack of desire to exercise, and dry mouth which can lead to ingestion of calorie-laden beverages. Eating low fat, low protein carbohydrate snacks and carbohydrate-rich dinners allows the brain to make serotonin which then controls appetite and balances mood. Carbohydrates thus eaten, as part of a balanced diet, by virtue of their effect on brain serotonin levels, thus support weight loss in the setting of antidepressant weight gain.\n\n【30】 #Controversy\nSeveral studies have stimulated doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants. A 2002 study cited that the difference between antidepressants and placebo is close to negligible.\nThe paper in question has been severely criticized by independent researchers, however. One reason for this is that it deals almost exclusively with the SSRI class of medication. In leveling criticism against the efficacy of SSRIs, critics state, it is not the best paper, merely the most widely known one. Also, other classes of antidepressants have demonstrated superior efficacy, and it has been argued that this paper is \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\", while its thrust should in fact be leveled at the serotonin hypothesis of depression.\nFurthermore, not all patients necessarily respond to a given medication, studies do not always address dosage versus drug-placebo differences for those who do. Data submitted to the FDA can also underestimate how a drug will perform in clinic practice, as studies sometimes are designed as much for marketing purposes as they are to estimate the magnitude of a medication's effects.\nMore than half of the 47 studies found that patients on antidepressants improved no more than those on placebos, Kirsch says The others included in his evaluation: Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor and Serzone.\nDr Joseph Glenmullen, a Harvard psychiatrist, has written a book on the subject for the layperson; see link below.\nIn 2007, anti-depressants became the most prescribed drug in the United States, causing more debate over the issue. Some doctors believe this is a positive sign that people are finally seeking help for their issues. Others disagree, saying that this shows that people are becoming too dependent on anti-depressants.\n\n【31】 #Non-mainstream treatments\nThere are numerous alternative treatments for depression, whether medications or other kinds of intervention.\n\n【32】 ## Opiates\nVarious Opiates were commonly used as antidepressants until the mid-1950s, when they fell out of favor with medical orthodoxy due to their addictive nature, tolerance buildup issues and their side-effect profile. Today the use of opioids in treating depression is a large taboo in the medical field due to associations with drug abuse; hence, research has proceeded at a very slow rate. A small clinical trial conducted at Harvard Medical School in 1995, demonstrated that a majority of treatment-refractory, unipolar, non-psychotic, major depression patients could be successfully treated with an opioid medication called Buprenorphine, which is a partial mu agonist and potent kappa antagonist. The exact mechanism of its action in depression is not known, as kappa (κ) antagonists are antidepressants in their own right.\nIn 2006, The Journal of European Neuropsychopharmacology published a follow-up study to the 1995 Harvard experiment, with results very consistent with the original Harvard findings. Eleven severely depressed patients, refractory to all the conventional depression treatments, were given small doses of buprenorphine. Most of these patients found the buprenorphine to be of significant benefit in relieving their inner torment. The researchers theorized that \"Possibly, the response to opiates describes a special subtype of depressive disorders e.g corresponding to a dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system and not of the monaminergic system.\"\nYet another relevant scientific paper was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1999, detailing how researchers found Oxycodone/Oxymorphone to help 5 out of 6 'incurable' refractory severe depression patients.\nWhile opioids have been proven to substantially relieve symptoms of depression for a large class of patients, re-acceptance of this fact has been severely hampered by governmental narcotic prohibition efforts, and the (until buprenorphine) lack of alternatives with low risk of tolerance and addiction. Buprenorphine is generally preferred as the first-line opiate in depression treatment, as managing the tolerance buildup of other opiates can be complicated.\n\n【33】 ## Other treatments\n- Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has been used by some as an antidepressant. Claude Rifat, a French biologist, conducted some early research into GHB's antidepressant potential. Rifat noted that GHB did not cause the emotional blunting effects caused by conventional antidepressants, but instead intensified pleasurable and rewarding feelings in the user while powerfully suppressing depression. However, GHB has now been outlawed, except for use as a prescription treatment for narcolepsy.\n- Clinical trials have shown the effect of acupuncture to be comparable with amitriptyline; in addition, specifically Electroacupuncture has been found to be more effective in depressive patients with decreased excretion of 3-methyl-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (the principal metabolite of the central neurotransmitter norepinephrine), while amitriptyline is more effective for those with inhibition in the dexamethasone suppression test. Acupuncture has also been proven to prompt the body to produce greater levels of endorphins.\n- Most studies conclude that St. John's wort is usually as effective against depressions as other modern medication, again with fewer side effects, and it is widely prescribed for depression in Europe. A recent study showed St. John's wort to be no more effective than a placebo in cases of severe depression, although an SSRI was also no more effective on the primary outcome measure.\n- The amino acid derivative SAM-e has been studied in recent years\n- Tryptophan dietary supplements, although banned in many countries due to impurities that caused a blood disease, have also been used as natural antidepressants. Dietary supplements of 5-HTP, a chemical the body forms from tryptophan and uses to make serotonin, have shown some promising research results but need further study.\n- NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and dextromethorphan have recently gained some interest in this field as their apparent ability to reverse opioid tolerance, and can give fast-acting dramatic effects. However, their acute psychoactive effects have been a problem.\n\n【34】 #Classes and members\nThe following clickable info-box is from the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System published by the World Health Organization.

It is derived from the Greek páthos (πάθος, disease) and gnōmon (γνώμον, \"judge\"). Labelling a sign or symptom \"pathognomonic\" represents a marked intensification of a \"diagnostic\" sign or symptom.\nWhile some findings may be classic, typical or highly suggestive in a certain condition, they may not occur uniquely in this condition and therefore may not directly imply a specific diagnosis.

Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy.\nMonitoring of hepatic function: Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of VFEND therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during VFEND therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of VFEND must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to VFEND.\n\n【3】 ### Visual Disturbances\nThe effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored.\n\n【4】 ### Pregnancy Category D\nVoriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\nIn animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality.\nIf this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n\n【5】 ### Galactose Intolerance\nVFEND tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\nvArrhythmias and QT Prolongation====\nSome azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.\nVoriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.\nRigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole.\n\n【6】 ### Infusion Related Reactions\nDuring infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur.\n\n【7】 ### Laboratory Tests\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of VFEND therapy.\nPatient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).\n\n【8】 ### Patients With Hepatic Impairment\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving VFEND .\nVFEND has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.\n\n【9】 ### Patients With Renal Impairment\nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy .\n\n【10】 ### Monitoring of Renal Function\nAcute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.\nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine.\n\n【11】 ### Monitoring of Pancreatic Function\nPatients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g. recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during VFEND treatment.\n\n【12】 ### Dermatological Reactions\nSerious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued.\nIn addition VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients should avoid intense or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued.\n\n【13】 ### Skeletal Adverse Events\nFluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "", "type3": null, "type4": "语意重复#1#1#And Precautions\n", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:06:32"}

Most commonly it is whether a patient takes their medication (Drug compliance), but may also apply to use of surgical appliances (e.g. compression stockings), chronic wound care, self-directed physiotherapy exercises, or attending for a course of therapy (e.g. counselling).\nIt has been estimated that in developed countries only 50% of patients who suffer from chronic diseases adhere to treatment recommendations.  Compliance rates during closely monitored research studies are usually far higher than in later real-world situations (e.g. up to 97% compliance in some studies on statins, but only about 50% of patients continue at six months).\nOne third of patients with hypertension resitant to triple therapy may be noncompliant.\nNonadherence may affect the patient's own immediate health or have implications for the wider society (e.g. failure to prevent complications from chronic diseases, formation of resistant infections or untreated psychiatric illness).\n\n【1】 #Terminology\nIt has been estimated that half of those for whom medicines are prescribed do not take them in the recommended way. Until recently this was termed \"non-compliance\", which was sometimes regarded as a manifestation of irrational behavior or willful failure to observe instructions, although forgetfulness is probably a more common reason, The word “adherence” may be preferred by many health care providers, because “compliance” suggests that the patient is passively following the doctor’s orders and that the treatment plan is not based on a therapeutic alliance or contract established between the patient and the physician. According to some, both terms are imperfect and uninformative descriptions of medication-taking behavior.\n\n【2】 #Causes\nCauses for poor compliance include:\n- Forgetfulness\n- Prescription not collected or not dispensed\n- Purpose of treatment not clear\n- Perceived lack of effect\n- Real or perceived side-effects\n- Instructions for administering not clear\n- Physical difficulty in complying (e.g. with opening medicine containers, handling small tablets or swallowing difficulties, travel to place of treatment)\n- Unattractive formulation (e.g. unpleasant taste)\n- Complicated regimen\nDose frequency. The following are a set of estimates of proportion of days compliant:\nOnce daily 84%\nTwice daily 75%\nThree times daily 59%\n- Cost of drugs\n\n【3】 #Detection\nNon-adherence can be detected by validated questionnaires and by assessing refill records.\nMedication levels may be needed.\nIn hypertension, patients with non-compliance may have a higher white coat effect.\n\n【4】 ## Assessment of refill records\nWhen refill records are accessible, many metrics can be calculated. The two most common are:\n- Medication Possession Ratio (MPR): \"the sum of the days’ supply for all fills of a given drug in a time period divided by the number of days in the time period\"\n- Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) is the same as the MPR but adjusts for days with double coverage of medications due to early refills.\nThe PDC is recommended by Medicarethe National Quality Forum (NQF)\nProviding refill information to health care providers can reduce clinical inertia and improve the quality of prescribing.\n\n【5】 ## Questionnaire\nAvailable surveys include:\n- MMAS-4 (4 items). s have been reported contested for the MMAS-4\n- Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, derived from MMAS-4 (8 items)\n- Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BRS)\n- The Adherence Estimator (3 items) developed by Merck Sensitivity was 88% if medium or high risk scores were combined and interpreted as abnormal.\n\n【6】 #Interventions\nInterventions to improve adherence have been reviewed.\n\n【7】 #Concordance\nConcordance is an approach at involving the patient in the treatment process to improve compliance and is a current UK NHS initiative.\n- Only recommending treatments that are effective in circumstances when they are required\n- Selecting treatments with lower levels of side effect or concerns for long-term use\n- Prescribing the minimum number of different medications, e.g. prescribing for someone with two concurrent infections a single antibiotic that addresses the sensitivities of both likely bacteria, rather than two separate courses of antibiotics. However, this also raises the spectre of developing antibiotic resistant species in the wider scenario.\n- Simplifying dosage regimen, whether by selecting a different drug or using a sustained release preparations that need less frequent dosages during the day.\n- Explanation of possible side effects and whether important to continue with the course of medication none-the-less.\n- Advice on minimising or otherwise coping with side effects, e.g. advice on whether to take a particular drug on an empty stomach or with food.\n- Developing trust between the patient and their doctor such that patients do not feel they will be embarrassed or seen as ungrateful if they are unable to take a particular drug, thus allowing a better tolerated alternative preparation to be tried.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 22:31:35"}

Common adverse reactions include diarrhea , nausea, transient decreased vision, fever, foreign body sensation, headache, transient ocular burning, ocular pain or discomfort and photophobia.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution is indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms:\n- Corynebacterium species\n- Staphylococcus aureus\n- Viridans group streptococci\n- Acinetobacter lwoffii\n- Haemophilus influenzae\n- Serratia marcescens\n- Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.\n\n【3】 ### Dosing Information\n- Instill one to two drops in the affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake, up to 8 times per day.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, to other quinolones, or to any of the components of this medication.\n\n【10】 - NOT FOR INJECTION. Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution should not be injected subconjunctially, nor should it be introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye.\n- In patients receiving systemic quinolones, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported, some following the first dose. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. If an allergic reaction to levofloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management should be administered as clinically indicated.\n\n【11】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n- As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slitlamp biomicroscopy, and where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most frequently reported adverse events in the overall study populations were transient decreased vision, fever, foreign body sensation, headache, transient ocular burning, ocular pain or discomfort, pharyngitis and photophobia. These events occurred in approximately 1-3% of patients. Other reported reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients included allergic reactions, lid edema, ocular dryness and ocular itching.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\n- Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, and enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant warfarin and its derivatives, and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving systemic cyclosporine concomitantly.\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Levofloxacin at oral doses of 810 mg/kg/day in rats, which corresponds to approximately 7,000 times the highest recommended human ophthalmic dose, caused decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality. No teratogenic effect was observed when rabbits were dosed orally as high as 50 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 400 times the highest recommended maximum human ophthalmic dose, or when dosed intravenously as high as 25 mg/kg/day, corresponding to approximately 200 times the highest recommended human ophthalmic dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Levofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Levofloxacin has not been measured in human milk. Based upon data from ofloxacin, it can be presumed that levofloxacin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution is administered to a nursing mother.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in infants below the age of one year have not been established. Oral administration of quinolones has been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\n- No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) Administration in the drug label.\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) and IV administrations.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (ophthalmic) overdosage\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Levofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents and its bactericidal action results from interference with the enzymes topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase enzyme activity, which are needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% is a sterile topical ophthalmic solution. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative ocular pathogens. Levofloxacin is the pure (-)-(s)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance, ofloxacin. It is more soluble in water neutral pH than ofloxacin.\n- Chemical Name: (-)-(s)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7Hpyrido -1,4 benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate. Levofloxacin (hemihydrate) is a yellowish-white crystalline powder. Each mL of Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution contains 5.12 mg of levofloxacin hemihydrate equivalent to 5 mg levofloxacin.\n- Active: Levofloxacin 0.5% ( mg/mL); Preservative: benzalkonium chloride 0.005%;\n- Inactives: sodium chloride and water for injection. May also contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution is isotonic and formulated at pH 6.5 with an osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/kg. Levofloxacin is a fluorinated 4-quinolone containing a six-member (pyridobenzoxazine) ring from positions 1 to 8 of the basic ring structure.\n\n【32】 ### MICROBIOLOGY:\n- Levofloxacin is the L-isomer of the racemate, ofloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent. The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin resides primarily in the L-isomer. The mechanism of action of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antimicrobials involves the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (both of which are type II topoismerases), enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Levofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms and is often bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations.\n- Corynebacterium species\n- Staphylococcus aureus\n- Viridans group streptococci\n- Acinetobacter lwoffii\n- Haemophilus influenzae\n- Serratia marcescens\n- Levofloxacin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2μg/mL or less (systemic susceptible breakpoint) against most (≥90%) strains of the following ocular pathogens:\n- Enterococcus faecalis - Legionella pneumophila - Moraxella catarrhalis - Citrobacter freudii\n- Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n- Proteus mirabilis - Providencia rettgeri\n- Escherichia coli\n- Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Klebsiella oxytoca\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Levofloxacin concentration in plasma was measured in 15 healthy adult volunteers at various time points during a 15 day course of treatment with Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution. The mean levofloxacin concentration in plasma 1 hour postdose, ranged from 0.86 ng/mL on Day 1 to 2.05 ng/mL on Day 15. The highest maximum mean levofloxacin concentration of 2.5 ng/mL was measured on Day 4 following 2 days of dosing every 2 hours for a total of 8 doses per day. Maximum mean levofloxacin concentrations increased from 0.94 ng/mL on Day 1 to 2.15 ng/mL on Day 15, which is more than 1,000 times lower than those reported after standard oral doses of levofloxacin. Levofloxacin concentration in tears was measured in 30 healthy adult volunteers at various time points following instillation of a single drop of Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution. Mean levofloxacin concentrations in tears ranged from 34.9 to 221.1 μg/mL during the 60-minute period following the single dose. The mean tear concentrations measured 4 and 6 hours postdose were 17.0 and 6.6 μg/mL. The clinical significance of these concentrations is unknown.\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- In a long term carcinogenicity study in rats, levofloxacin exhibited no carcinogenic or tumorigenic potential following daily dietary administration; the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day) was 875 times the highest recommended human ophthalmic dose. Levofloxacin was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay (S. typhimurium and E. coli), CHO/HGPRT forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, mouse dominant lethal test, rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and the in vivo mouse sister chromatid exchange assay. It was positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration (CHL cell line) and in vitro sister chromatid exchange (CHL/IU cell line) assays. Levofloxacin caused no impairment of fertility or reproduction in rats at oral doses as high as 360 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 3,150 times the highest recommended human ophthalmic dose.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\n- In randomized, double-masked, multicenter controlled clinical trial where patients were dosed for 5 days, Levofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution demonstrated clinical cures in 79% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis on the final study visit day (day 6-10). Microbial outcome for the same clinical trials demonstrated an eradication rate for presumed pathogens of 90%.\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\nLevofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% is supplied in a natural, low density polyethylene bottle with a controlled dropper tip and a tan, high density polyethylene cap in the following size:\n\n【37】 Rx Only\nManufactured in India for:\nNexus Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nVernon Hills, IL 60061.\nDistributed by:\nPack Pharmaceuticals,\nLLC, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089.\n\n【38】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F)\n\n【39】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【40】 PACK Pharmaceuticals, LLC\nLEVOFLOXACIN OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION\nFOR TOPICAL APPLICATION IN THE EYE\nRx only (5 mL) Sterile\n\n【41】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye, fingers or other source.

In Austria, as the only country in the world, even experiments on lesser apes, the gibbons, are completely banned too.\nThese countries have ruled that chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans are cognitively so similar to humans that using them as test subjects is unethical. Announcing the UK’s ban in 1986, the British Home Secretary said: \"his is a matter of morality. The cognitive and behavioural characteristics and qualities of these animals mean it is unethical to treat them as expendable for research.\" Britain continues to use other primates in laboratories, such as macaques and marmosets.\nThe British newspaper, The Independent, has argued that the \"demand for a comprehensive ban by the European Union on experiments involving great apes is surely unanswerable\"\nThe United States is the world's largest user of chimpanzees for biomedical research, with approximately 1,300 individuals currently in U.S. labs. A Washington-state group called Ban Ape Research (BAR) is campaigning to enact an ordinance in Seattle that would prohibit non-human great-ape experiments in that city, which would be the first jurisdiction in the U.S. to take this step.\nIn 2006 the permanency of the UK ban was questioned by Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council. Blakemore, while stressing he saw no \"immediate need\" to lift the ban,  argued \"that under certain circumstances, such as the emergence of a lethal pandemic virus that only affected the great apes, including man, then experiments on chimps, orang-utans and even gorillas may become necessary.\" The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection described Blakemore's stance as \"backward-looking.\"", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:12:47"}

The herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods.\nCMV infections are frequently associated with salivary glands, though they may be found throughout the body. CMV infection can also be life threatening for patients who are immunocompromised (e.g. patients with HIV, organ transplant recipients, or neonates). CMV viruses are found in many mammal species, but CMV species isolated from animals differ from human CMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been reported to cause human disease.\nIn humans, CMV is found throughout all geographic locations and socioeconomic groups, and infects between 50% and 80% of adults in the United States as indicated by the presence of antibodies in much of the general population.  CMV is also the virus most frequently transmitted to a developing child before birth. CMV infection is more widespread in developing countries and in areas of lower socioeconomic conditions and causes the most birth defects in industrialized countries of all the herpes viruses.\n\n【2】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nCMV is the most common cause of congenital infection in humans and intrauterine primary infections are second only to Down's syndrome as a known cause of mental retardation. The incidence of primary CMV infection in pregnant women in the United States varies from 1% to 3%. Healthy pregnant women are not at special risk for disease from CMV infection. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital  viral infection in the United States.\n\n【3】 ## Laboratory Findings\nMost infections with CMV are not diagnosed because the virus usually produces few, if any, symptoms and tends to reactivate intermittently without symptoms. However, persons who have been infected with CMV develop antibodies to the virus, and these antibodies persist in the body for the lifetime of that individual. A number of laboratory tests that detect these antibodies to CMV have been developed to determine if infection has occurred and are widely available from commercial laboratories. In addition, the virus can be cultured from specimens obtained from urine, throat swabs, bronchial lavages and tissue samples to detect active infection. Both qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for CMV are available as well, allowing physicians to monitor the viral load of CMV-infected patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (or ELISA) is the most commonly available serologic test for measuring antibody to CMV.\n\n【4】 ## Medical Therapy\nNo treatment is generally necessary for CMV infection in the healthy individual since the majority of infections resolve on their own. Antiviral drug therapy is now being evaluated in infants. Ganciclovir treatment is used for patients with depressed immunity who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses. Valganciclovir (marketed as Valcyte) is an antiviral drug that is also effective and is given orally. The therapeutic effectiveness is frequently compromised by the emergence of drug-resistant virus isolates. A variety of amino acid changes in the UL97 protein kinase and the viral DNA polymerase have been reported to cause drug resistance. Foscarnet or cidofovir can be given in patients with CMV resistant to ganciclovir, though foscarnet is not as well tolerated as ganciclovir.\n\n【5】 ## Future or Investigational Therapies\nVaccines to help prevent CMV infection are still in the research and development stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-28 00:07:50"}

It is also found as the variety Pinus radiata var. binata or Guadalupe Pine on Guadalupe Island, and a possibly separable P. radiata var./subspecies—ssp. cedrosensis on Cedros Island, both in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the northern Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and Spain it is the leading introduced tree and in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Kenya, and South Africa it is a major plantation species.\n\n【3】 #Description\nIt is closely related to Bishop Pine and Knobcone Pine, hybridizing readily with both species; it is distinguished from the former by needles in threes (not pairs), and from both by the cones not having a sharp spine on the scales.\nThe modern tree is vastly different from the native tree of Monterey. In plantations the tree is commonly planted at 3m x 3m spacing on a wide variety of landscapes from flat to moderatly steep hills.Because of selective breeding and more recently the extensive  use of Growth Factor seedlings, forests planted since the 1990s are of superior wood with very straight tall trunks without the problem of twin leaders. The trees are pruned in 3 lifts so that the lower 2/3 of a mature tree is branch- ( and hence knot-) free.\nIn its natural state, the wood is poor quality: twisted, knotty and full of sap/resin only really suitable for firewood, but the modern product is very different.\n\n【4】 #Ecology\nMonterey Pine is a species adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather.\nIn its native range, Monterey Pine is associated with a characteristic flora and fauna. It is the co-dominant canopy tree together with Cupressus macrocarpa which naturally occurs only in coastal Monterey County. Furthermore, one of the pine forests in Monterey, California, was the discovery site for Hickman's potentilla, an endangered species. Piperia yadonii, a rare species of orchid is endemic to the same pine forest adjacent to Pebble Beach. In its native range, Monterey Pine is a principal host for the dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium littorum.\nA remnant Monterey Pine stand in Pacific Grove is a prime wintering habitat of the Monarch butterfly.\n\n【5】 ## California\nThe three remaining wild stands of var. radiata (Monterey Pine proper) are infected and under threat of extirpation from Pine Pitch Canker caused by Fusarium circinatum, a fungal disease native to the southeast United States and found (in 1986) to have been introduced to California. When trees begin to die of the disease, they attract bark beetles which provide a pathway for infection of other trees. In some stands, 80–90% of trees are infected. If the disease is introduced in agroforestry areas dependent upon Monterey Pine, such as New Zealand, it could have catastrophic effects in those countries as well.\n\n【6】 ## Baja California\nOn Guadalupe Island, var. binata is critically endangered. Most of the population was destroyed as tens of thousands of feral goats ate binata seedlings and caused soil erosion from the mid-19th century until just a few years ago. The older trees gradually died off until by 2001–2002 the population stood at only one hundred. With a program to remove the goats essentially complete by 2005, hundreds of young Guadalupe Pines have started to grow up in habitat fenced after 2001, the first significant new growth in about 150 years. Possible accidental introduction of Pine Pitch Canker is considered the biggest threat at present to the survival of the Guadalupe Island pine population. The University of California's Russell Reservation forestry research station hosts an orchard planted with 73 Pinus radiata seedlings from Guadalupe Island and plays an important role in conserving the binata variety.\n\n【7】 ## Australia\nAustralia has large P. radiata plantations (though they are less than 2% of the total forested area); so much so that many Australians are concerned by the resulting loss of native wildlife habitat. A few native animals, however, thrive on them, notably the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo which, although deprived of much of its natural diet by massive habitat alteration through clearing for agriculture, feeds on P. radiata seeds. They are also the most common tree used for Christmas trees in Australia.\n\n【8】 ## Chile\nP. radiata has also been introduced to the Valdivian temperate rain forests, where vast plantations have been planted for timber, again displacing the native forests.\n\n【9】 ## New Zealand\nThe Monterey Pine (always called Pinus radiata in New Zealand) was first introduced into New Zealand in 1859 and today 89% of the country's plantation forests are of this species. This includes the Kaingaroa Forest on the central plateau of the North Island which is the largest planted forest in the world. Mass plantings became common from 1900 in the Rotorua area where prison labour was used. In some areas it is considered an invasive species (termed a wilding conifer or more commonly wilding pine) where it has escaped from plantations. It is the most extensively used wood in New Zealand.\nA 1995 change to the New Zealand building regulations no longer required boron treatment of radiata pine to be used for framing houses, a key factor in the subsequent expensive leaky homes crisis. From 2003 onward a series of changes have now improved the regulations.\n\n【10】 ## United States\nThe Monterey Pine is widely used in private gardens and public landscapes in temperate California, and similar climates around the world. It is a fast-growing tree, adaptable to a broad range of soil types and climates, though does not tolerate temperatures below about −15 °C (Expression error: Missing operand for *. ). Its fast growth makes it ideal for landscapes and forestry; in a good situation, P. radiata can reach its full height in 40 years or so.\n\n【11】 ## United Kingdom\nP. radiata is grown as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n【12】 #Uses\nAs timber Radiata is suitable for a wide variety of uses. It holds screws and nails well and takes paint and stain without difficulty - and modern kiln dried timber is very easy to work. It is about 1/3 heavier than dried western Red cedar and about the same weight as New Zealand and Fijian Kauri. It is brittle when bent, so does not have the same load bearing features as Oregon pine (Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga).\nRadiata is used in house construction as weatherboards, posts, beams or plywood, in fencing, retaining walls, for concrete formers - and to a limited extent in boat building where untreated ply is sometimes used, but must be encased in epoxy resin to exclude moisture.\nThe wood is normally kiln dried to 12% moisture in 6m long, clear lengths. It is available treated with a range of chemical salts, or untreated. Chemical salt treatment is well proven and such timber is frequently used in the ground as posts and poles as part of structures such as retaining walls and pole houses. The name applied to this treatment is  tanalized wood. H1 and H2 treatment is suited to indoor use. H3 is  the standard house timber and this grade is used for fence palings. H4 and H5 are the standard for inground use.\nLower grade timber is converted to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Plywood is peeled from logs in long sheets. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol waterproof glue.\nIn 1958, boat designer Des Townson started building 186 eleven-foot, cold-moulded Zepher class yachts, using Pinus radiata. In 2011 these hand built boats fetch very high prices and are generally in excellent condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 19:09:20"}

The first known racemic mixture, or racemate, was 'racemic acid', which Pasteur found to be a mixture of the two enantiomeric isomers of tartaric acid.\n\n【1】 #Properties\nA racemate is optically inactive: because the two isomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions they cancel out, therefore a racemic mixture does not rotate plane-polarized light.\nIn contrast to the two separate enantiomers, which generally have identical physical properties, a racemate often has different properties compared to either one of the pure enantiomers. Different melting points and solubilities are very common, but different boiling points are also possible.\nPharmaceuticals may be available as a racemate or as pure enantiomer, which might have different potencies. It is nowadays regulated by law that both enantiomers have to be tested separately for their pharmacological effects .\n\n【2】 #Crystallization\nThere are three ways a racemate can crystallize, this is important for the resolution of a racemate by crystallisation. Precise ways to distinguish between these crystal forms were summarised already in 1899 by H. W. B. Roozeboom.\n- Conglomerate (sometimes racemic mixture or racemic conglomerate)\n- Racemic compound (sometimes true racemate)\n- Quasiracemate.\n\n【3】 #Resolution\nThe separation of a racemate into its components, the pure enantiomers, is called a chiral resolution. There are various methods, including crystallization, chromatography and the use of enzymes. The first successful resolution of a racemate was performed by Louis Pasteur, who manually separated the crystals of a conglomerate.\n\n【4】 #Synthesis\nWithout a chiral influence (for example a chiral catalyst, solvent or starting material), a chemical reaction that makes a chiral product will always yield a racemate. That can make the synthesis of a racemate cheaper and easier than making the pure enantiomer, because it does not require special conditions. This fact also leads to the question how biological homochirality evolved on a presumably racemic primordial earth.\nThe reagents of, and the reactions that produce, racemic mixtures are said to be \"not stereospecific\" or \"not stereoselective\", for their indecision in a particular stereoisomerism.\n\n【5】 #Racemic pharmaceuticals\nSome drug molecules are chiral and the enantiomers have different effects on biological entities. They can be sold as one enantiomer or as a racemic mixture. Examples include Thalidomide, Ibuprofen, and Salbutamol. Adderall is a mixture of several different enantiomers.  A single amphetamine dose combines the neutral sulfate salts of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and d, l-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate.\nIn some cases (e.g. Ibuprofen and Thalidomide) the enantiomers are interconverted in vivo. This means that preparing a pure enantiomer for medication is largely pointless.\nIn cases like Salbutamol and Thalidomide the inactive isomer may be harmful.\nMethamphetamine is available by prescription under the brand name Desoxyn. The active component of Desoxyn is dextro-methamphetamine hydrochloride. This is the right-hand isomer of methamphetamine. The left-handed isomer of methamphetamine, levo-methamphetamine, is less centrally acting and more peripherally acting; therefore a racemic mixture of dextro/levo-methamphetamine isn't used in current medical practice.  In the past, due to different levels of restrictions on precursor chemicals and lack of knowledge by those preparing the final product, racemic methamphetamine was produced and sold on the black market.  Newer techniques typically use asymmetric synthesis methods and yield a majority of d-methamphetamine and relatively little l-methamphetamine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:43", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:22:59"}

The dosage can be adjusted based on achievement and maintenance of each patient's therapeutic goals.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Velaglucerase alfa in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Velaglucerase alfa in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- VPRIV is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.\n- VPRIV should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The recommended starting VPRIV dosage in naïve pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is 60 Units/kg administered every other week as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The dosage can be adjusted based on achievement and maintenance of each patient's therapeutic goals.\n- Switching from Imiglucerase to VPRIV\n- Pediatric patients 4 years of age and older currently being treated on a stable dosage of imiglucerase for type 1 Gaucher disease may be switched to VPRIV by starting treatment with VPRIV at the previous imiglucerase dosage two weeks after the last imiglucerase dose. VPRIV should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The dosage can be adjusted based on achievement and maintenance of each patient's therapeutic goals.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Velaglucerase alfa in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Velaglucerase alfa in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- None.\n\n【9】 ### Precautions\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis - Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred. Hypersensitivity reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with VPRIV in clinical studies. Patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to infusion of VPRIV during clinical studies. The most commonly observed symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and pyrexia. Generally the reactions were mild and, in treatment-naïve patients, onset occurred mostly during the first 6 months of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time.\n- As with any intravenous protein product, hypersensitivity reactions are possible, therefore appropriate medical support including personnel adequately trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures and access to emergency measures should be readily available when VPRIV is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion of VPRIV and initiate appropriate medical treatment.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The data described below reflect exposure of 94 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who received VPRIV at doses ranging from 15 Units/kg to 60 Units/kg every other week in 5 clinical studies. Fifty-four  patients were naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and received VPRIV for 9 months and 40 patients switched from imiglucerase to VPRIV treatment and received VPRIV for 12 months. Patients were between 4 and 71 years old at time of first treatment with VPRIV, and included 46 male and 48 female patients.\n- The most serious adverse reactions in patients treated with VPRIV were hypersensitivity reactions.\nThe most common adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions.\n- Less common adverse reactions affecting more than one patient (>3% in the treatment-naïve group and >2% in patients switched from imiglucerase to VPRIV treatment) were bone pain, tachycardia, rash, urticaria, flushing, hypertension, and hypotension.\n- Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients\n- Immunogenicity\n- As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In clinical studies, 1 of 54 enzyme treatment-naïve patients treated with VPRIV developed IgG class antibodies to VPRIV. In this patient, the antibodies were determined to be neutralizing in an in vitro assay. No hypersensitivity reactions were reported for this patient. It is unknown if the presence of IgG antibodies to VPRIV is associated with a higher risk of infusion reactions. Patients with an immune response to other enzyme replacement therapies who are switching to VPRIV should continue to be monitored for antibodies to VPRIV.\n- Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to VPRIV with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Velaglucerase alfa in the drug label.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Velaglucerase alfa Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category B\n- Risk Summary\n- There are no adequate and well controlled studies with VPRIV in pregnant women and there is limited experience in pregnant women. However, animal reproduction studies have been conducted for VPRIV. In these animal studies, no fetal harm was observed in rats or rabbits when velaglucerase alfa was administered intravenously during organogenesis at doses with exposures up to 1.8 times and 4.3 times greater than, respectively, the recommended human daily dose. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, VPRIV should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Clinical Considerations\n- Disease-Associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk\n- Data - Animal Data - Reproduction studies with velaglucerase alfa have been performed in pregnant rats at intravenous doses up to 17 mg/kg/day (102 mg/m2/day, about 1.8 times greater than the recommended human dose of 60 Units/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day or 55.5 mg/m2/day based on the body surface area). Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (240 mg/m2/day, about 4.3 times the recommended human dose of 60 Units/kg/day based on the body surface area). These studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to velaglucerase alfa.\n- A pre- and postnatal development study in rats showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre-and postnatal development at doses up to 17 mg/kg/day (102 mg/m2/day, about 1.8 times greater than the recommended human dose of 60 Units/kg/day based on the body surface area).\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Velaglucerase alfa in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Velaglucerase alfa during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether VPRIV is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Exercise caution when VPRIV is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of VPRIV have been established for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients between 4 and 17 years of age with type 1 Gaucher disease. Use of VPRIV in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of VPRIV in 74 adult patients and 20 pediatric patients. The safety and efficacy profiles were similar between pediatric and adult patients. The efficacy and safety of VPRIV has not been established in pediatric patients younger than 4 years of age.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\n- In clinical studies of VPRIV in Gaucher's disease, a total of 56 VPRIV-treated patients were 65 years of age or older including 10 patients who were 75 years of age or older. Among 205 patients who switched from imiglucerase to VPRIV, 52 patients were 65 years of age or older of which 10 were 75 years and older. The adverse reaction profile in elderly patients was consistent with that previously observed across pediatric and adult patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be approached cautiously, considering potential comorbid conditions.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Velaglucerase alfa with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Velaglucerase alfa with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Velaglucerase alfa in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Velaglucerase alfa in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Velaglucerase alfa in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Velaglucerase alfa in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Velaglucerase alfa in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\n- VPRIV is a lyophilized powder, which requires reconstitution and dilution, using sterile technique, prior to intravenous infusion. VPRIV should be prepared as follows:\n- Determine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient's weight and the prescribed dose.\n- Inject 4.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into a vial containing VPRIV lyophilized powder.\n- Mix gently. DO NOT SHAKE. The reconstituted VPRIV solution will have a 100 Units/mL concentration (400 Units VPRIV in 4 mL of solution).\n- If additional vials are needed, repeat steps (b) and (c)\n- Visually inspect the reconstituted VPRIV solution in the vials. The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless. Do not use if the solution is discolored or if foreign particulate matter is present.\n- With a single syringe, withdraw the calculated dose of drug from the appropriate number of vials. Using a separate syringe, withdraw air from a bag of 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution suitable for intravenous administration. Then dilute the calculated dose of VPRIV directly into the sodium chloride solution. Mix gently. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight flocculation (described as white irregular shaped particles) may occasionally occur. Diluted solution with slight flocculation is acceptable for administration.\n- Because VPRIV contains no preservatives, use the reconstituted VPRIV solution and the diluted VPRIV solution immediately. If immediate use is not possible, the reconstituted VPRIV solution or the diluted VPRIV solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at 2 °C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F). Do not freeze and protect from light. Complete the infusion within 24 hours of reconstitution of vials.\n- Discard any unused solution.\n\n【27】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Velaglucerase alfa in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene, which results in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the conversion of the sphingolipid glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide. The enzymatic deficiency causes an accumulation of glucocerebroside primarily in the lysosomal compartment of macrophages, giving rise to foam cells or \"Gaucher cells\". Velaglucerase alfa catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside, reducing the amount of accumulated glucocerebroside. In clinical trials VPRIV reduced spleen and liver size, and improved anemia and thrombocytopenia.\n- In this lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), clinical features are reflective of the accumulation of Gaucher cells in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and other organs. The accumulation of Gaucher cells in the liver and spleen leads to organomegaly. Presence of Gaucher cells in the bone marrow and spleen lead to clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【29】 ## Structure\n- The active ingredient of VPRIV is velaglucerase alfa, which is produced by gene activation technology in a human fibroblast cell line. Velaglucerase alfa is a glycoprotein of 497 amino acids; with a molecular weight of approximately 63 kDa. Velaglucerase alfa has the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring human enzyme, glucocerebrosidase. Velaglucerase alfa contains 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites; four of these sites are occupied by glycan chains. Velaglucerase alfa contains predominantly high mannose-type N-linked glycan chains. The high mannose type N-linked glycan chains are specifically recognized and internalized via the mannose receptor present on the surface on macrophages, the cells that accumulate glucocerebroside in Gaucher disease. Velaglucerase alfa catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycolipid glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide in the lysosome.\n- VPRIV is a hydrolytic lysosomal glucocerebroside-specific enzyme. VPRIV is dosed by Units/kg, where one Unit of enzyme activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to convert one micromole of p-nitrophenyl ß-D-glucopyranoside to p-nitrophenol per minute at 37°C.\n\n【30】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Velaglucerase alfa in the drug label.\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- In a multicenter study conducted in pediatric (N=7, 4 to 17 years old) and adult (N=15, 19 to 62 years old) patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed at Weeks 1 and 37 following 60-minute intravenous infusions of VPRIV 60 Units/kg every other week. Serum velaglucerase alfa concentrations declined rapidly with a mean half life of 11 to 12 minutes. The mean velaglucerase alfa clearance ranged from 6.72 to 7.56 mL/min/kg. The mean volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 82 to 108 mL/kg (8.2% to 10.8% of body weight).\n- No accumulation or change in velaglucerase alfa pharmacokinetics over time from Weeks 1 to 37 was observed upon multiple-dosing 60 Units/kg every other week.\n- Based on the limited data, there were no notable pharmacokinetic differences between male and female patients in this study. The effect of age on pharmacokinetics of velaglucerase alfa was inconclusive.\n- The effect of anti-drug antibody formation on the pharmacokinetic parameters of velaglucerase alfa is unknown.\n\n【32】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential or studies to evaluate mutagenic potential have not been performed with velaglucerase alfa.\n- In a male and female fertility study in rats, velaglucerase alfa did not cause any significant adverse effect on male or female fertility parameters up to a maximum dose of 17 mg/kg/day (102 mg/m2/day, about 1.8 times the recommended human dose of 60 Units/kg/day based on the body surface area).\n\n【33】 #Clinical Studies\n- The efficacy of VPRIV was assessed in three clinical trials in a total of 99 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease: 82 patients age 4 years and older received VPRIV and 17 patients age 3 years and older received imiglucerase. Studies I and II were conducted in patients who were not currently receiving Gaucher disease-specific therapy. Study III was conducted in patients who were receiving imiglucerase treatment immediately before starting VPRIV. The long-term safety of VPRIV was assessed in Study IV, an open-label extension trial in a total of 93 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease ages 3 years and older. Patients who had completed Studies I to III were eligible to participate in Study IV. In Studies I through IV, VPRIV was administered intravenously over 60 minutes at a maximum dose of 60 Units/kg every other week. Doses above 60 Units/kg were not studied in these trials.\n- Study I was a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose-group, multinational trial in 25 patients age 4 years and older with Gaucher disease-related anemia and either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. Patients were not allowed to have had disease-specific therapy for at least the previous 30 months; all but one had no prior therapy. The mean age was 26 years and 60% were male. Patients were randomized to receive VPRIV at a dose of either 45 Units/kg (N=13) or 60 Units/kg (N=12) every other week. The recommended starting dose in naïve patients is 60 Units/kg. The 45 Units/kg dosage is not recommended as a starting dose in naïve patients.\n- At baseline, mean hemoglobin concentration was 10.6 g/dL, mean platelet count was 97 × 109/L, mean liver volume was 3.6 % of body weight (% BW), and mean spleen volume was 2.9 % BW.\n- For all studies, liver and spleen volumes were measured by MRI The observed change from baseline in the primary endpoint, hemoglobin concentration, was considered to be clinically meaningful in the 60 Units/kg dose, in light of the natural history of untreated Gaucher disease.\n- At baseline, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 11.0 g/dL, mean platelet count was 171 × 109/L, and mean liver volume was 4.3 % BW. For the patients who had not had splenectomy (7 in each group) the mean spleen volume was 3.4 % BW. After 9 months of treatment, the mean absolute increase from baseline in hemoglobin concentration was 1.6 g/dL ± 0.2 (SE) for patients treated with VPRIV. The mean treatment difference in change from baseline to 9 months  was 0.1 g/dL ± 0.4 (SE).\n- In both studies, examination of age and gender subgroups did not identify differences in response to VPRIV among these subgroups. The number of non-Caucasian patients in these studies was too small to adequately assess any difference in effects by race.\n\n【34】 #How Supplied\n- VPRIV is a sterile, preservative free, lyophilized powder requiring reconstitution and further dilution prior to use. It is supplied in individually packaged glass vials, which are closed with a butyl rubber stopper with a fluoro-resin coating and are sealed with an aluminum overseal with a flip-off plastic cap. The vials are intended for single use only.\n- Storage\n- Store VPRIV at 2 °C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not use VPRIV after the expiration date on the vial. Do not freeze.\n- Protect vial from light.\n\n【35】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Velaglucerase alfa Storage in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Advise patients that VPRIV is a treatment that is given intravenously every other week. The infusion typically takes up to 60 minutes.\n\n【37】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Velaglucerase alfa interaction has not been established.

Presently both are considered B. animalis with the subspecies Bifidobacterium animalis subsp animalis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis.\nBoth old names B. animalis and B. lactis are still used on product labels, as this species is frequently used as a probiotic. In most cases it is not clear which subspecies is used in the product.\n\n【1】 #Trade names\nB. animalis, strain number DN 173 010, is used worldwide as a probiotic in the product Activia, produced by the Danone company (known as Dannon in the US). The company uses different trade names in different countries : Bifidus Digestivum (UK), Bifidus Regularis (US and Mexico), Bifidobacterium Lactis or B.L.

The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day topiramate) adverse reactions causing discontinuation in this trial were difficulty with memory, fatigue, asthenia, insomnia, somnolence, and paresthesia.\n\n【3】 ### Pediatric Patients 6 to <16 Years of Age\nThe adverse reactions in the controlled trial that occurred most commonly in pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day topiramate group and at a rate higher (≥ 5%) than in the 50 mg/day group were fever, weight decrease, mood problems, cognitive problems, infection, flushing, and paresthesia .\nApproximately 14% of the 77 pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day group who received topiramate as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day topiramate) adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation in this trial were difficulty with concentration/attention, fever, flushing, and confusion.\n\n【4】 ## Incidence in Study 119 - Add-On Therapy - Adults with Partial Onset Seizures\nStudy 119 was a randomized, double-blind, add-on/adjunctive, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with 3 treatment arms: 1 placebo; 2 topiramate 200 mg/day with a 25 mg/day starting dose, increased by 25 mg/day each week for 8 weeks until the 200 mg/day maintenance dose was reached; and 3 topiramate 200 mg/day with a 50 mg/day starting dose, increased by 50 mg/day each week for 4 weeks until the 200 mg/day maintenance dose was reached. All patients were maintained on concomitant carbamazepine with or without another concomitant antiepileptic drug.\nThe incidence of adverse reactions  did not differ significantly between the 2 topiramate regimens. Because the frequencies of adverse reactions reported in this study were markedly lower than those reported in the previous epilepsy studies, they cannot be directly compared with data obtained in other studies.\n\n【5】 ## Other Adverse Reactions Observed During All Epilepsy Clinical Trials\nTopiramate has been administered to 2246 adults and 427 pediatric patients with epilepsy during all clinical studies, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these studies, all adverse reactions were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse reactions, similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified WHOART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of patients who experienced a reaction of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving topiramate. Reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous tables or text, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug.\nReactions are classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.\n- Autonomic Nervous System Disorders: Infrequent: vasodilation.\n- Body as a Whole: Frequent: syncope.

Rare: lymphocytosis.\n\n【7】 ## Postmarketing and Other Experience\nIn addition to the adverse experiences reported during clinical testing of topiramate, the following adverse experiences have been reported worldwide in patients receiving topiramate post-approval.\nThese adverse experiences have not been listed above and data are insufficient to support an estimate of their incidence or to establish causation. The listing is alphabetized: bullous skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hepatic failure (including fatalities), hepatitis, maculopathy, pancreatitis, and pemphigus.\nThe most common (>5% more frequent than placebo or low-dose topiramate in monotherapy) adverse reactions in controlled, epilepsy clinical trials were paresthesia - anorexia - weight decrease\n- fatigue\n- dizziness\n- somnolence\n- nervousness\n- psychomotor slowing\n- difficulty with memory\n- cognitive problem\n- confusion, mood problems\n- fever\n- infection\n- flushing\n- Rarely, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may be strong enough to cause metabolic acidosis of clinical importance.\nA GlaxoSmithKline-sponsored Phase IV (post-marketing) study suggested that cognitive side effects may be more common with topiramate than with lamotrigine. In studies of healthy volunteers, comparing the two medications, therapeutic doses of topiramate for bipolar disorder produced greater cognitive deficits than lamotrigine, including short term memory loss and word-finding difficulty. This effect has led to the occasional use of the name \"dopamax\" by some dissatisfied customers.  A flat affect was reported in > 75% patients (n=60).\nThe most common side effects include a change in taste (carbonated beverages, especially diet sodas and beer, taste particularly bad) and feelings of pins and needles in the head and extremities.  Less common side effects include cognitive deficiency (particularly word-finding difficulty); grogginess; lethargy; renal (kidney) stones, impairment of fine motor skills; vision abnormality and transient or permanent vision loss ; weight loss; breast pain; abdominal pain; intense sweating; menstrual disorder; taste changes; pharyngitis; sinusitis; diplopia; rash; leukopenia; fatigue; dizziness; insomnia; anxiety; depression; paresthesia; diarrhea; nausea; dyspepsia; constipation; dry-mouth; dysmenorrhea.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a notification alerting physicians who prescribe topiramate, and their patients, to the risk of vision loss (blindness). Acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma, in a small subset of patients who take topiramate regularly, may cause transient (reversible), or permanent, loss of vision. The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. If addressed early in its course, discontinuation of topiramate, along with other measures deemed prudent by the prescribing physician and/or ophthalmologist, may halt the progression of the ocular damage, and may reverse the visual impairment. Patients who take topiramate and who feel pain in or around their eyes, or notice a loss of vision, visual acuity, or blurred vision, are advised to seek consultation with their physician as soon as reasonably possible. According to the FDA: \"in more than 825,000 patients.As of August 17, 2001 there have been 23 reported cases: 22 in adults and 1 in pediatric patients. It is generally recognized that postmarketing data are subject to substantial under-reporting.\"\nAnother serious side-effect is the development of osteoporosis in adults and children (bones affected break more easily) and rickets (abnormal, deformed growth of bones) in children. Topiramate may also slow the growth of children. All of these conditions should be detected early by performing regular clinical examinations of the patients.\nIn other postmarketing research, a risk of decreased sweating and hyperthermia was  discovered. Pediatric patients (children) are especially prone to this side-effect. It is recommended that children treated with topiramate should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. All patients, particularly those with other predisposing factors, should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:42", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:34:50"}

Partial derivatives are useful in vector calculus and differential geometry.\nThe partial derivative of a function f with respect to the variable x is written as fx, ∂xf, or ∂f/∂x.  The partial-derivative symbol ∂ is a rounded letter, distinguished from the straight d of total-derivative notation.  The notation was introduced by Legendre and gained general acceptance after its reintroduction by Jacobi.\n\n【1】 #Definition\nSuppose that f is a function of more than one variable.  For instance,\nThe function f can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\nIn other words, every value of x defines  a function, denoted fx, which is a function of one real number.  That is,\nOnce a value of x is chosen, say a, then f(x,y) determines a function fa which sends y to a2 + ay + y2:\nIn this expression, a is a constant, not a variable, so fa is a function of only one real variable, that being y.  Consequently the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\nThis is the partial derivative of f with respect to y.  Here ∂ is a rounded d called the partial derivative symbol.  To distinguish it from the letter d, ∂ is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\nIn general, the partial derivative of a function f(x1.,xn) in the direction xi at the point (a1.,an) is defined to be:\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a scalar-valued function f(x1.xn) on a domain in Euclidean space Rn (e.g. on R2 or R3). In this case f has a partial derivative ∂f/∂xj with respect to each variable xj. At the point a, these partial derivatives define the vector\n\n【2】 #Examples\nConsider the volume V of a cone; it depends on the cone's height h and its radius r according to the formula\nThe partial derivative of V with respect to r is\nIt describes the rate with which a cone's volume changes if its radius is varied and its height is kept constant. The partial derivative with respect to h is and represents the rate with which the volume changes if its height is varied and its radius is kept constant.\nNow consider by contrast the total derivative of V with respect to r and h. They are, respectively and\nWe see that the difference between the total and partial derivative is the elimination of indirect dependencies between variables in the latter.\nNow suppose that, for some reason, the cone's proportions have to stay the same, and the height and radius are in a fixed ratio k:\nThis gives the total derivative:\nEquations involving an unknown function's partial derivatives are called partial differential equations and are common in physics, engineering, and other sciences and applied disciplines.\n\n【3】 #Notation\nFor the following examples, let f be a function in x, y and z.\nFirst-order partial derivatives:\nSecond-order mixed derivatives:\nHigher-order partial and mixed derivatives:\nWhen dealing with functions of multiple variables, some of these variables may be related to each other, and it may be necessary to specify explicitly which variables are being held constant.  In fields such as statistical mechanics, the partial derivative of f with respect to x, holding y and z constant, is often expressed as\n\n【4】 #Formal definition and properties\nLike ordinary derivatives, the partial derivative is defined as a limit. Let U be an open subset of Rn and f : U → R a function. We define the partial derivative of f at the point a = (a1., an) ∈ U with respect to the i-th variable xi as\nlim_{h \\rightarrow 0},\nf(a_1, \\dots , a_{i-1}, a_i+h, a_{i+1}, \\dots ,a_n)\nf(a_1, \\dots ,a_n) \\over h\nEven if all partial derivatives ∂f/∂xi(a) exist at a given point a, the function need not be continuous there. However, if all partial derivatives exist in a neighborhood of a and are continuous there, then f is totally differentiable in that neighborhood and the total derivative is continuous. In this case, we say that f is a C1 function. We can use this fact to generalize for vector valued functions (f : U → R'm) by carefully using a componentwise argument.\nThe partial derivative \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} can be seen as another function defined on U and can again be partially differentiated. If all mixed second order partial derivatives are continuous at a point (or on a set), we call f a C2 function at that point (or on that set); in this case, the partial derivatives can be exchanged by Clairaut's theorem:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#1#1#At the point a, these partial derivatives define the vector 后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#2#2#The partial derivative of V with respect to r is 后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-27 18:09:42", "update_time": "2024-04-27 23:08:32"}
