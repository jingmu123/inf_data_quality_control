     Studies indicate that rates of hospitalization are higher among young children than older children when influenza viruses are in circulation .
     Because children aged 6-23 months are at substantially increased risk for influenza-related hospitalizations, ACIP recommends vaccination of all children in this age group . ACIP continues to recommend influenza vaccination of persons aged >6 months who have high-risk medical conditions.
     The current inactivated influenza vaccine is not approved by FDA for use among children aged <6 months, the pediatric group at greatest risk for influenza-related complications . Vaccinating their household contacts and out-of-home caregivers might decrease the probability of influenza infection among these children.
