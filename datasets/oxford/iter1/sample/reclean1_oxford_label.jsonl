Although it is considered one of the most fatal tumors in the world, its early diagnosis is associated with a better prognosis and overall survival. A 49-year-old man was admitted to the dermatology department with a 15 cm lesion on the left arm. It was growing on a congenital nevus to reach an enormous size. Surgical excision was not possible and the treatment was controversial as the patient showed unpredicted resistance to immunotherapy. Further evaluations revealed false-negative BRAF mutation, which completely changed the course of treatment. Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer. Although there is no decisive definition of giant melanoma, some authors define it as a lesion of more than 10 cm in diameter. Through the literature, only a few cases of giant melanoma on the arm have been reported. Through our paper, we are revealing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma and confirming the significant role of regular follow-up for patients with a congenital melanocytic nevus. Moreover, we are showing the importance of having alternative methods for detecting BRAF mutations to avoid false-negative results and have better outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Malignant melanoma represents only about 1% of all skin cancers and <1% grows on a congenital nevus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, melanoma is an aggressive tumor and its incidence is increasing. It usually tends to grow rapidly but rarely measures more than 10 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, we reported a giant pigmented nodular melanoma that was neglected and disregarded, and it grew on a congenital nevus.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male was presented to our clinic with a wide ulcerated skin lesion on the upper area of the left arm. It started 6 months earlier on a congenital nevus, which remained unchanged since birth. There were no skin tumors in his family history. Laboratory tests were within the normal range. Physical examination showed a reddish-brown to black-colored, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion. It measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 2 cm in the left deltoid area .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Clinical image showing a giant cutaneous lesion, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion.</u>\n\n【7】There were many differential diagnoses. Nodular melanoma appears as an amelanotic symmetrical and well-circumscribed papule or nodule with a uniform color, although it can be melanotic and ulcerated occasionally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Lentigo maligna melanoma manifests as an irregular pigmented large patch or macule on sun damaged areas of the skin or as hypomelanotic/amelanotic papule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Superficial spreading melanoma presents as a scalloped, asymmetric and irregular papule or macule arising on previous nevi or developed _de novo_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】A cutaneous biopsy was performed and sent to the pathology department. Microscopic examination of the biopsy revealed proliferation of variably size nodules of malignant cells in the dermis . Infiltrated atypical polymorphic melanocytes with mild lymphoid inflammatory cells  and coarse brown pigments were observed . The malignant cells had large hyperchromatic nuclei with basophilic cytoplasm . To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains were applied. The tumor cells were positive for melanoma cocktail  and were negative for pan-cytokeratin . We did not perform dermoscopy because of its size and necrotic status, which pushed us to do the biopsy as early as possible.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin and eosin stain ( **A** – **D** ) and IHC ( **E** and **F** ): Microscopic images of cutaneous biopsy.

Therefore, targeted therapy with anti-BRAF drugs was excluded and the patient underwent chemotherapy with dacarbazine 250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1 → D5. A good response started after two courses but the patient had rapid progression after initiating the third course, which encouraged us to change the protocol to paclitaxel 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15 and carboplatin 150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15, but there was no response. At that stage, the patient suffered from disabled left arm due to severe pain and edema. Immunotherapy with nivolumab 280 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> was initiated, but unfortunately, there was no response observed after three courses. Surgical consultation claimed that surgical intervention is inapplicable due to locally advanced disease. Another wedge biopsy was taken for further histopathology evaluation. The result was identical to the first biopsy. The tumor was invading to anatomic level (at least V-Clark) and a measured depth (at least 3.5 cm-Breslow). The second BRAF mutation analysis, in contrast to the first one, came positive for BRAF V600E mutation. Targeted therapy with vemurafenib 960 mg was initiated. A significant response was noted within 2 weeks, including the appearance , edema, pain and distant metastases. Three months later, a brain MRI showed multiple lesions in both brain lobes and the brainstem with altered mental status and confusion. Unfortunately, the patient deteriorated rapidly and died due to complications of his brain metastases.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Clinical image shows very good response and the lesion has regressed properly after 1 month of targeted therapy.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Through the literature, only a few cases of giant melanoma on the arm have been reported. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. 50–70% of melanomas have positive BRAF mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Better survival and a quicker response to treatment in patients with positive BRAF mutation had been reported after the development of the BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The BRAF gene organizes and adjusts the division and senescence of the cells to prevent the proliferation of cancer precursor cells, by encoding a protein kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The deregulation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway occurs when the BRAF mutation gets activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. V600E type is the most observed BRAF mutation in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the lesion has been neglected by the patient, evolving rapidly to reach an enormous size. Such growing on a congenital nevus may have been a contributing factor in the ignorance of this lesion. A false-negative BRAF mutation result, using polymerase chain reaction, led us to exclude targeted therapy. Unresponsiveness to immunotherapy was unjustified, which guide us to order a second BRAF mutation analysis, and in contrast to the first one, it came positive for BRAF mutation. False-negative BRAF mutation results can be a threatening problem, eventuating in delayed treatment and poor outcomes. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using VE1, unlike DNA-based techniques, recognizes the therapeutic target protein and estimates its expression in malignant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, IHC is less expensive, can be used on fewer tumor cells, is simpler and has faster results compared to DNA-based techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, IHC using VE1 can only detect the V600E mutation. Therefore, combining both, DNA-based techniques and IHC using VE1 can lead to more accurate results in BRAF mutation analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive type of skin cancer that can arise from a pre-existing congenital nevus. Our case reveals the significant role of regular follow-up on any pigmented skin lesions, especially melanocytic nevus. Furthermore, it indicates the importance of having alternative methods for detecting BRAF mutations to avoid false-negative results and therefore have better outcomes.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>REGISTRATION OF RESEARCH STUDIES\n--------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

However, the clinical role of endothelial function tests in VSA-induced STEMI is not fully understood. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with atypical chest pain and no coronary risk factors. STEMI caused by VSA was diagnosed. Flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and EndPAT tests were performed; the FMD and reactive hyperaemia index were 3.8% and 1.23, respectively. Endothelial dysfunction is the putative cause of STEMI. FMD and EndPAT tests might be useful for predicting adverse outcomes in young premenopausal women with VSA.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronary artery vasospasm (VSA) can cause anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) which is relatively infrequent manifestation of myocardial infarction with nonobstractive coronary artery (MINOCA; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>). VSA has been reported to be more common in male smokers with significant coronary risk factors who are over the age of 50–60. VSA is less common among young adult premenopausal women. Oestrogen prevents coronary spasm while vascular endothelial dysfunction may develop into VSA in adolescent and young adult patients without coronary risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We have recently experienced VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA in a premenopausal woman without coronary risk factors who had atypical chest pain and endothelial dysfunction. Since understanding of the pathophysiology of STEMI in MINOCA, and provocative testing for VSA has not always been recommended in STEMI in MINOCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, it is extremely important to discuss the role of systemic endothelial function tests in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 43-year-old woman (158 cm, 41 kg) visited our outpatient clinic because of intermittent atypical chest wall pain lasting for > 20 min from the day before presentation. Pain was not associated with effort or any triggers. Present history revealed that pain was sharp and intermittently occurred for all day long. She first visited other clinics and was referred to our hospital the next day. She did not have chest pain or any other symptoms when she visited our outpatient clinic, her heart rate was 80 beats/min and regular and her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg. There were no risk factors for coronary artery disease. Relevant past medical history was negative, including the absence of any gynaecological problems and on no medications including birth control pills. She also denied a menstrual period at the time of the clinic visit and had a regular menstrual cycle. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V2–5 with super-acute tall T waves . The chest radiograph was normal. Laboratory data showed positive troponin T (>0.1 ng/ml; TROP T sensitive R \\[Roche Diagnostic Inc. Tokyo, Japan\\]) and the other positive data were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 89 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 29 U/l; creatine phosphokinase, 758 U/l; white blood cell count, 10 500/μl and serial changes are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The other parameters were within the normal range. Echocardiography revealed segmental anterior severe hypokinesis, and Takotubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis were excluded. Emergency coronary angiography showed no significant stenotic lesions. Before angiography, aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel sulphate 300 mg were orally administered as standard treatment for STEMI. However, a bolus injection of 100-μg acetylcholine into the left coronary descending artery revealed 90% occlusion of the proximal portion of the artery, which was relieved by intra-coronary nitroglycerin injection. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) was diagnosed due to coronary spasm . The clinical course was stable with administration of a calcium antagonist (benidipine hydrochloride 4 mg b.i.d) and aspirin (100 mg, q.d.). About 3 months after MI episode, flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD, measured by EF18G; UNEX, Nagoya, Japan) and peripheral tonometry of EndPAT tests were performed (reactive hyperaemia index \\[RHI\\], measured by EndPAT2000 system \\[Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel\\]) after washing out of medication around 2 p.m. As a result, the FMD and RHI were 3.8% and 1.23, respectively . Endothelial dysfunction was observed. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Serial changes in 12-lead ECG.

( **A** ) From the left, short and long axis images of brachial artery before reactive hyperaemia, and maximally dilated short and long axis images of brachial artery after reactive hyperaemia, are shown. ( **B** ) A-mode ultrasound images of brachial artery diameter are shown. The flat lines indicate the longitudinal diameters of the brachial artery, which are identical to the values obtained from the images in (A). ( **C** ) The changes in blood flow velocity (arrow labelled ‘a’) and the changes of longitudinal diameters of brachial artery from rest to after the reactive hyperaemia (arrow named ‘b’) are continuously plotted along the time course and the maximal percent changes of brachial diameters in response to reactive hyperaemia are determined. These changes are endothelial cell dependent. ( **D** ) EndPAT2000 measurement is another method of assessing endothelial function. It is a reactive hyperaemia-peripheral tonometry test. It mainly reflects not only nitric oxide but also endothelium-dependent hyperpolarising factor and prostacyclin. This method measures blood flow changes by reactive hyperaemia and endothelial function, and is similar to FMD. After the upper arm occlusion by cuff with a pressure above either systolic pressure of 60 or 200 mmHg for 5 min, the cuff was released. The measurement of both index fingers’ blood flow by tonometry throughout the study was performed. Reactive hyperaemia-related endothelial-dependent blood flow increase was measured. Based on the measurement of the flow of both fingers, suspected artefacts are cancelled and real blood flow increase can be detected, as shown in . A comparison between before and after reactive hyperaemia is conducted in hyperaemia-induced finger and is adjusted by comparing the flow changes of the other fingers. The ratio after/before (RHI) was then determined. If RHI was < 1.67, endothelial dysfunction was diagnosed. In this case, endothelial dysfunction was observed. Same as RHI method, hyperaemia-related endothelial-dependent brachial artery diameter vasodilatation was measured by ultrasound in FMD. This vasodilatation is mainly caused by endothelial-dependent nitric oxide release. FMD, flow-mediated vasodilatation; RHI, reactive hyperaemia index. FMD < 4.0% and RHI < 1.67 are significantly abnormal.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】The main features of this patient were as follows: first, VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA in a premenopausal young adult woman without gynaecological problems; second, no significant coronary risk factors or organic comorbidity; third, complaint of atypical chest pain; and finally, impaired endothelial function revealed by FMD and RHI.\n\n【13】In this case, VSA-induced STEMI due to VSA was diagnosed, and abnormal endothelial function tests were performed. In young premenopausal women complaining of chest pain, VSA, coronary artery microvascular dysfunction, coronary artery dissection, Takotubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis are important disorders to consider in the differential diagnosis and these were excluded in this case. Coronary endothelial dysfunction has been well investigated for the possible pathophysiology of VSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. FMD and RHI were measured in the afternoon and in the fasting phase as well as the appropriate menstrual phase. In the settings where the confounding factors influencing endothelial function and the diurnal variation of endothelial function in VSA were taken into account 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; her endothelial function was the most likely aetiological factor. In the chronic phase of her clinical course, when STEMI did not influence the endothelial function test, FMD and RHI showed significant endothelial dysfunction. FMD was < 4.0%, while RHI was < 1.67, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】A previous study showed that decreased FMD and RHI reflect adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease, and FMD could possibly be a significant modality for diagnosing coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, reports on the prognostic and diagnostic values of FMD and RHI in VSA are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, where significantly lower FMD and RHI values were observed, the important role of systemic endothelial function in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA might be significant. In addition, among the calcium antagonists that are first-line medications for VSA, we chose benidipine hydrochloride according to a previous report, and the patient’s condition was stable under this medication. If benidipine is not available, either nifedipine of 40 mg or diltiazem of 200 mg daily is acceptable therapy, and no further treatments except aspirin were necessary because any risk factors did not exist.\n\n【15】Since this case showed relatively atypical chest symptoms and most patients with VSA have been reported to be asymptomatic or have an atypical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, the supplemental use of either FMD or RHI in already diagnosed VSA for predicting subsequently developing STEMI could be indicated. In addition, according to the findings of this case, the prognostic value of either FDM or RHI in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA should be prospectively investigated. This kind of study would be worth conducting in the near future. This case provides a clue to the above-mentioned concept.\n\n【16】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【17】There are no conflicts of interest pertaining to any authors.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】None declared.\n\n【20】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【21】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for this report.\n\n【22】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【23】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for this publication.\n\n【24】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【25】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Pleural effusion in myeloma is rare and may result from myelomatous infiltration of the pleura or heart failure in cardiac amyloidosis. Benign causes of pleural effusion include infection, hypoalbuminemia or chronic renal impairment. Myelomatous pleural effusion (MPE) is diagnosed via pleural fluid cytomorphology and flow cytometry for malignant PCs, protein electrophoresis or pleural biopsy. A 74-year-old man with immunoglobulin A myeloma developed recurrent MPE with possible secondary cardiac amyloidosis. Despite achieving partial remission in serum paraprotein, the effusion was refractory to percutaneous drainage and pleurodesis. The treatment is aimed at eradicating myeloma and relieving respiratory symptoms. Early recognition of myeloma progression into extramedullary infiltration and secondary amyloidosis is important. While chemotherapy intensification in older patients can be challenging, multidisciplinary management is essential in alleviating symptoms and in improving the quality of life.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pleural effusion during the course of treatment for myeloma may be caused by infection, hypoalbuminemia or chronic renal impairment. Rarely, myeloma may progress into extramedullary infiltration of the pleura or secondary amyloidosis which carries poor prognosis. Treatment with chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients, may cause further morbidity, and the overall condition should be managed within a multidisciplinary setting.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A previously fit 74-year-old male presented with lethargy and reduced effort tolerance for 1 month. He had normochromic normocytic anemia (8.3 g/dl), raised creatinine (143 μmol/l), hypercalcemia (3.34 mmol/l), hypoalbuminemia (27 g/l) and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. He was diagnosed with R-ISS Stage II multiple myeloma (MM) following the detection of serum monoclonal paraproteinaemia immunoglobulin A (IgA) Kappa (37 g/l) and Bence Jones protein 789 mg/l. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy demonstrated 47% plasma cells (PCs) infiltration with positivity toward CD138 and Kappa light chain restriction. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotype, however, fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization detected deletion 13q and an extra copy of TP53 gene in 55% of the cells analyzed. The beta-2 microglobulin was raised by 7.2 mg/l. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan demonstrated no bone lesions, however, there was right-sided pleural effusion  possibly due to inadvertent fluid overload secondary to hyperhydration for hypercalcemia, which resolved with frusemide on subsequent chest X-ray . A baseline echocardiogram was normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|PET-CT scan demonstrated right-sided pleural effusion due to inadvertent fluid overload secondary to hyperhydration for hypercalcemia.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** , **B** ) Chest x-ray with clear bilateral lung fields after treatment with frusemide (A); presence of bilateral mild pleural effusion upon completion of first chemotherapy cycle with concurrent development of AF and dyspnea (B).</u>\n\n【8】After completion of the first chemotherapy cycle, which consisted of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, he developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and dyspnea. Chest X-ray showed mild bilateral pleural effusion . Echocardiogram detected concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with 15-mm thickness and dilated left atrium . The ejection fraction was preserved at 59%. Tissue doppler imaging of the septal wall showed reduced septal velocity of 4 cm/s and elevated E/e’ value of 19.49, with apical sparing pattern and reduced global longitudinal strain value of −16.8% . Myeloma-associated cardiac amyloidosis was suspected. The serum pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was elevated at >9000 pg/ml, however, a troponin level was not available. BM trephine and transcutaneous fat pad biopsies were negative for Congo red stain. CT scan revealed no hepatomegaly or pulmonary alveolar infiltrate.

He achieved partial remission after two cycles of chemotherapy with paraprotein reduction to 6.6 g/l. Unfortunately, the malignant effusion recurred a month later. Bilateral seldinger tubes (12Fr) were inserted with cumulative pleural fluid drainage of 5200 ml on the right and 4250 ml on the left, followed by left talc pleurodesis, and the left chest drain was successfully removed. However, he continued to have persistent drainage on the right, and an indwelling pleural catheter was considered. Lenalidomide was introduced as a part of VRD chemotherapy to salvage the disease. The option of radiotherapy was discussed, however, the patient continued to deteriorate with sepsis and succumbed a few weeks later.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Pleural effusion occurred in 6% of MM patients predominantly due to amyloidosis-related congestive heart failure, while other causes include MPE, infection, hypoalbuminemia and chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. MPE is a rare extramedullary manifestation associated with poor prognosis. The incidence of MPE was 2.65% with a median survival of 2.47 months and occurred at median age of 50 years with a male predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. MPE was the presenting feature in 45.45% of patients, predominantly unilateral in 81.8% patients, and the majority of the disease subtype was IgG Kappa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We report a patient with IgA MM who developed MPE with possible secondary cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【17】The diagnosis of MPE requires demonstration of neoplastic PC on pleural fluid cytology, immunophenotyping, pleural fluid electrophoresis or pleural biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Differentiating neoplastic from reactive PC can be morphologically challenging, especially in the presence of cellular degeneration or inadequate sample size. Immunophenotyping provides diagnostic precision by detecting aberrant antigen expression on malignant PC, especially in patients with negative cytology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Normal PC express CD38 and CD138, while malignant PCs may also express CD19, CD45 or CD56 with light chain restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient demonstrated transudative pleural effusion with morphologically dysplastic PC positive for CD19, CD38, CD 138, CD45 and CD56.\n\n【18】Concomitant AF, elevated pro-BNP and LV hypertrophy raised the suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, which may also have contributed to the patient’s recurrent pleural effusion. Up to 30% of patients with MM have sub-clinical amyloid deposits, while 15% may suffer from overt amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cardiac amyloidosis may be diagnosed non-invasively by cardiac MRI or nuclear scintigraphy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Biopsy of endomyocardial tissue may be needed in equivocal cases or discordant data. Abdominal fat aspirate can be performed, where Congo red stain will detect 70–90% amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Large and persistent effusions refractory to diuretics and thoracentesis are likely caused by pleural amyloid infiltration by inhibition of pleural fluid absorption into the lymphatic circulation, the diagnosis of which may be demonstrated with pleural tissue biopsy via closed percutaneous route or thoracoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】MPE predicts poor outcomes with a short survival time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Treatment is directed at eliminating myeloma with systemic chemotherapy, while symptomatic therapy, such as diuretics, thoracentesis and pleurodesis, may provide some relief to improve the quality of life. Despite reduction in serum paraprotein with bortezomib-based chemotherapy, the patient required multiple admissions for thoracentesis and pleurodesis for the refractory effusion. In the era of novel agents, patients with extramedullary involvement respond poorly to therapy, indicating the biological differences between intramedullary and extramedullary disease.

It has a very low reported incidence and is more prevalent in women and patients over 50 years of age. The most frequent clinical manifestations of tracheal injury are subcutaneous emphysema and respiratory distress. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implantation under general anesthesia. Shortly after extubation, dyspnea and subcutaneous emphysema appeared. The X-ray showed pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and pneumoperitoneum. The tracheal rupture was confirmed by bronchoscopy. After conservative treatment, the patient's well-being improved, and she was discharged from the hospital in a satisfactory condition.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Iatrogenic tracheal rupture is a life-threatening airway complication. Its real incidence is largely unknown. However, some authors reported it to be as low as 0.005% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The causes of rupture are considered to be the interlacing of anatomical, mechanical and uncertain factors. A clinical diagnosis can be made when subcutaneous emphysema, respiratory failure and pneumomediastinum develop. A suspected tracheal rupture should be confirmed by bronchoscopy to clarify the location and length of rupture. A rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to avoid mediastinitis and other above-mentioned complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Decisions regarding surgical or conservative treatment must be made based on patient’s general state, clinical, radiological and endoscopic data. Prognosis of tracheal rupture depends mainly on the patient’s underlying disease, cause of intubation and the severity of the intervention.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】We report a case of a 65-year-old woman with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, heart failure III-IV (NYHA), severe mitral insufficiency and severe pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography shows left ventricular ejection fraction near 25%, biventricular dyssynchrony (septal to posterior wall motion delay 155 ms); on electrocardiogram—sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, QRS—160 ms . Surgical intervention of the mitral valve was not recommended by the cardiac surgeon due to the high risk to benefit ratio.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|ECG before CRT-D implantation.</u>\n\n【7】Despite the guideline-directed medical therapy with beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, loop diuretic, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, the patient had frequent hospitalization due to the exacerbation of heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation was considered.\n\n【8】Due to the persistence of the acute heart failure symptoms despite the therapy with i/v loop diuretics, the CRT-D implantation was suggested as the only chance to improve the patient’s general condition. Since the patient was unable to maintain a supine position, the procedure was technically possible only under general anesthesia.\n\n【9】During the procedure, vital parameters were within the normal range. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further observation. The patient was awakened and extubated after full assessment of her vital parameters. Within 10 minutes of her extubation, the patient’s condition became extremely critical. She started to suffer dyspnea, panting, shallow breathing, acrocyanosis and desaturation. Pulse oximetry was near 45%. Inspection revealed subcutaneous emphysema within her face and chest area. With auscultation of the lungs, reduced respiratory sounds were noticed on both sides. The patient was hemodynamically unstable. Against the backdrop of vital evidence tracheal reintubation was introduced and mechanical ventilation was started.\n\n【10】Bronchoscopy confirmed rupture of the proximal part of the trachea, namely under the vocal cords. Chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema, pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum and signs of pneumoperitoneum in the right subdiaphragmatic space . After reintubation patient’s respiratory symptoms were stable and per the thoracic surgeon’s decision patient remained under observation and conservative treatment, without further surgical intervention. Due to unstable hemodynamic parameters, which was caused by the decreased systolic function of the heart and rapid accumulation of the air in the pericardium, the patient received an intravenous infusion of dobutamine and norepinephrine. We observed an increase in inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells. The patient’s blood culture was inoculated, after which for the prevention of mediastinitis broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (Ceftriaxone) was started, in addition to continued treatment for heart failure.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Chest X-ray after tracheal rupture.</u>\n\n【12】After symptoms were thus treated, the subcutaneous emphysema subsided, and the X-ray image revealed improvement. On the fourth day following the rupture incident, the patient was extubated successfully with bronchoscopic control, and her oxygen dependence was removed. The laboratory data reflected significant improvement, and the patient was discharged from the hospital with guideline-recommended medication for heart failure.\n\n【13】One month later, at a follow-up visit, the patient confirmed improvement in her well-being, heart failure symptoms had decreased (from NYHA III–IV to NYHA II–III), the ejection fraction increased (from 25% to 29%), and there was a strong improvement of septal to posterior wall motion delay (from 155 ms to 135 ms) and QRS duration (from 160 ms to 120 ms) .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|ECG after CRT-D implantation.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Adequate treatment of tracheal rupture depends on the size of the lesion, clinical manifestation, underlying pathology, respiratory status and overall condition of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. If these factors allow, this complication should be treated with the least invasive methods, hence reducing the need to perform surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A small tear (about 1 cm in length), as long as there is no gross air leak nor respiratory failure, can be treated conservatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If the size of the tear exceeds 2 cm and any relatively large and progressive subcutaneous emphysema and/or respiratory distress are observed, the most effective treatment under such circumstances is early surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】However, some authors reported the effectiveness of conservative treatment even with larger lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Conservative management should be prioritized whenever possible—where a patient does not require mechanical ventilation or if it is possible without any loss of tidal volume, and when subcutaneous emphysema is mild and does not cause airway obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. According to different authors, this choice is independent of the length of the lesion and includes lesions close to the carina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Some authors recommend conservative nonoperative therapy as the optimal choice for patients who will require prolonged mechanical ventilation to treat their underlying respiratory status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Surgical intervention is strongly recommended if the damage compromises the full thickness of the posterior membrane, and mediastinal structures protrude into the tracheal lumen.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】During trachea rupture, treatment should be tailored to the individual’s needs, which will depend on the lesion’s location, size and severity. Conservative treatment is recommended with small lacerations or patients with stable respiratory dynamics. In case of relatively large damage with an unstable patient, surgical intervention is the stronger suggestion.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>To all the healthcare professionals who participated in the care of this case.

Preoperative sequential MRI in this case clearly showed the intermuscular-septum line 通用删除1(英):<u>(red arrows in Figs 1 and 2 )</u> and direct tumoral invasion beyond the intermuscular septum. A histopathological investigation 通用删除1(英):<u>(red square in Fig. 1 )</u> showed the direct invasion to the intermuscular septum although synovial sarcoma should be an indolent tumor . Although some soft tissue sarcoma such as myxofibrosarcoma sometimes show direct invasion to these barriers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, synovial sarcoma seldom shows such direct invasive pattern to barriers, much less the greatest barrier like an intermuscular septum. Moreover, in the patients with synovial sarcoma, wide-margin surgery with even though thin barriers resulted in good local control rates. Although synovial sarcoma usually cannot show such a local invasive pattern, a relatively indolent tumor growth might allow for such unfamiliar development of a tumor, even against a robust barrier. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported such unique extension of a synovial sarcoma beyond the intermuscular septum. We believe that these radiological and pathological findings have a huge impact to sarcoma surgeons. Surgeons should be aware of the potential vulnerability of the intermuscular septum. A careful preoperative examination is warranted to obtain a safe margin in sarcoma surgery.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication, and gave their consent.

A 21 year old male patient presented with diplopia for one year, more for distance than near and spent more than 8-10 hours for near tasks. Unaided visual acuity in BE was 2/60 and was 6/9 in RE and 6/6 in LE with correction. Prism base cover test revealed 25 BO PD for distance and 20 BO PD for near.

It is important to understand the pathogenesis of this entity and consider other possible causes of esotropia in myopia. Key words: Myopia, Esotropia, Comitant, Diplopia.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Esotropia in myopia is a rare entity with varied presentation in different age groups. The examination and management of such patients can be very challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most common etiology of progressive esotropia in high myopia in an elderly is the ‘Heavy Eye Syndrome’, which presents with diplopia secondary to progressive esotropia and hypotropia with limitation of abduction and elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Another uncommon form of esotropia in young adults is Acute Acquired Comitant Esotropia (ACCE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Prolonged adduction of the medial rectus muscle due to near-target convergence may cause shortening of the medial rectus muscle and reduced ability to maintain orthotropia at a distance as proposed by Guyton 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This paper reports a similar case of a young adult with high myopia with diplopia.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 21-year-old myopic patient presented with diplopia for 1 year. It was more for distance than during near work. He did ~8–10 hours of near work without using glasses as it reduced his diplopia.\n\n【8】The patient had no history of head trauma, use of systemic medication or systemic illnesses. Ophthalmic examination revealed unaided visual acuity (VA) of 2/60 in both eyes and used −5.75 DS in the right eye (RE), giving VA of 6/36 and −5.75DS/−0.50 DC @180 in the left eye (LE), giving VA of 6/24. Cyclo-refraction revealed wet retinoscopic values of −8.00 DS/−1.50 DC @180 and −7.75 DS/−2.00 DC @180 in RE and LE, respectively.\n\n【9】On orthoptics examination, the Hirschberg test revealed 2 mm (30 diopters) eso-deviation in RE. Extra ocular movement was full. The worth four dot test revealed diplopia for distance and near, with maximum separation of images in levoversion. The Prism Base Cover Test with correction revealed 25 Base Out (BO) Prism Diopter (PD) for distance and 20 BO PD for near ; and without correction, it was 16 BO PD and 8 BO PD for distance and near, respectively. Accommodative convergence to accommodation ratio was 4:1 and was done by the gradient method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The axial length measurement of RE was 26.91 mm and 26.99 mm of LE.

A prism trial of 6 BO PD in RE and 6 BO PD in LE was started, which removed diplopia for near and decreased for distance.\n\n【13】Definite management was done after 3 months with RE 8 mm lateral rectus (LR) resection. During surgery, thinning of LR muscle was seen, and its histo-pathological examination revealed features of chronic myopathy with primarily collagenous tissue with a single area of scattered muscle fibers and marked endomysial fibrosis, suggestive of LR Muscle atrophy .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Histopathology section using special stain of LR muscle section.</u>\n\n【15】After 1 month, the patient was orthotropic with BCVA 6/6 in both eyes with glasses and no diplopia .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|RE orthotropic 1 week after surgery.</u>\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】AACE is a special subtype of esotropia that is characterized by the acute onset of comitant esotropia with diplopia and is more common in older children and adults. Ocular motility is generally normal without the evidence of paralysis of the extraocular muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. AACE is classified into three clinical types by Lee _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>: (i) Swan-type esotropia that occurs in eyes with fusion disruption, (ii) Burian-Franceschetti type of esotropia characterized by minimal hypermetropia and diplopia, often associated with physical and psychological stress and (iii) Beilschowsky-type esotropia that occurs in adolescents and adults with varying degree of myopia. The mechanism of Beilchowsky-type AACE is thought to be uncorrected myopia with excessive near work, resulting in the inability to maintain the balance between the converging and diverging forces of the eye, and the subsequent development of increased tonus of the medial rectus muscle, leading to esotropia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a study of acquired distance esotropia associated with myopia in young adults by Zheng K _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, 11 adult myopic patients with distance esotropia were studied, who were engaged in near work for an average of 12 hours per day. Among them, seven underwent a pathological examination of their LR muscles, which showed no muscle fibers but rather collagenous fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In another study by Zhu M _et al._ , it was found that ACCE was more common in young adults who performed excessive close visual activities and used digital devices late night 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Since most of our daily activities are performed over smart phones, smartphone use is the majority of ‘near work’.

Anaemia treatment and reduction of transfusion-need are, therefore, major therapeutic goals in patients with low-risk MDS.

Herein, we provide further information regarding treatment after DPO failure among low-risk patients with MDS and report our experience of long-term CERA use and treatment after CERA failure.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 65-year-old Japanese woman, whose detailed clinical information has been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, was diagnosed with MDS via bone marrow aspiration in 2008. She had refractory anaemia, as defined by the World Health Organization and was categorized by the IPSS (the International Prognostic Scoring System) as belonging to the low-risk group (IPSS low or Int-1). She had diabetes since 1991; with resultant renal insufficiency, haemodialysis was initiated in January 2015. She was transfusion dependent, with haemoglobin levels maintained at 6.5 g/dl via transfusion every week 44 during the predialysis period. Frequent transfusions resulted in congestive heart failure and secondary hemochromatosis; she was diagnosed with transfusion-associated circulatory overload. Accordingly, treatment with epoetin α (9000 IU/week) plus DPO (40 μg/week) was started with haemodialysis initiation. However, even after ESA initiation, she continued to require transfusion. In July 2015, we increased the DPO dose to 240 μg/week. After 2 weeks of DPO treatment, the anaemia resolved; she no longer needed transfusions, and the haemoglobin concentration was maintained at > 10 g/dl. From March 2016, she gradually developed resistance to DPO treatment. In July 2016, her haemoglobin concentration rapidly decreased to 6.8 g/dl and she needed transfusions again. We then switched the ESA from DPO to CERA (250 μg/week) in August 2016. After switching, the haemoglobin concentration again gradually increased, and she no longer needed further transfusions. No progression of anaemia was observed for 3 years and 4 months; her haemoglobin concentration was stable at > 10 g/dl. In December 2019, although her iron metabolism was stable and anaemia treatment did not change, her haemoglobin concentration fell to < 10 g/dl, reaching 8.9 g/dl in January 2020. Throughout this period, no obvious physical changes or particular adverse events were observed. Accordingly, we suspected that the drop was caused by CERA treatment failure and initiated roxadustat treatment. First, roxadustat at 150 mg/week was initiated along with CERA (150 μg/week), and the roxadustat dose was later increased to 300 mg/week. Her haemoglobin concentration increased again, and we decided to gradually switch the drug to roxadustat alone and decreased CERA to 50 μg/week. However, this change resulted in a decrease in the haemoglobin concentration. Therefore, we administered both CERA (150 μg/week) plus roxadustat (300 mg/week). Her haemoglobin level is currently maintained at >10 g/dl for over a year .\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】The clinical course of our patient provides two important indications: (i) CERAs may be able to reduce the transfusion-need among low-risk patients with MDS and (ii) roxadustat when used along with ESAs may be able to control anaemia.\n\n【12】The introduction of CERA in MDS treatment may be favourable for low-risk patients with MDS. In our case, CERA treatment led to a long-term freedom from transfusions. ESAs lose their effectiveness with regard to anaemia treatment in low-risk patients with MDS in a few years. Epoetin loses its effectiveness in 0.42 years and DPO in 0.75 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Prevention from transfusion-dependent anaemia leads to improved QoL and overall survival in low-risk MDS patients. In low-risk MDS patients, the utility scores from which quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are calculated are higher for transfusion independence than for transfusion dependence, with a difference of 0.24 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Furthermore, as she avoided treatment for iron overload caused by transfusions, she obtained a utility score of at least 0.21 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus, she achieved 1.65 QALYs after CERA treatment.\n\n【13】Roxadustat may compensate for the loss of effectiveness of CERA in low-risk MDS patients if anaemia results from the loss of effectiveness of CERA. In our case, although adding roxadustat to CERA resulted in recovery from anaemia, when we stopped CERA treatment, the anaemia recurred. Although the starting dose was low (1.67 mg/kg), roxadustat may not induce sufficient effects as a single agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Roxadustat as well as granulocyte colony stimulating factor may achieve a 30% improvement in ESA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and reduce ESA resistance among low-risk patients with MDS by suppressing apoptosis of haematopoietic stem cells.\n\n【14】The following points should be noted when interpreting this case report: first, anaemia progression while using CERA may not have resulted from ESA resistance. However, the abovementioned discussion about the combination of ESA and roxadustat holds because reducing the dose of ESAs diminished the effects of roxadustat, leading to the promotion of anaemia. Second, the safety of using roxadustat in patients with MDS has not been confirmed. Roxadustat should not be used for solid tumours, and the results of a phase III trial concerning its use in low-risk MDS patients are awaited.\n\n【15】In our case, we examined the long-term use of CERA in a low-risk patient with MDS having anaemia and found that after the failure of CERA, supplementation with roxadustat was effective. Although further evidence is required, ESAs may extend the no-transfusion period among low-risk patients with MDS.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Hideki Hattori, who is our patient’s haematologist in Yao Municipal Hospital.

Kambo is produced from the sections of the _Phyllomedusa bicolor_ (Boddaert, 1772) _tree frog._ Also known as the giant leaf frog, two-coloured leaf frog, waxy-monkey tree frog and kambô, is native to South America. Its use is part of a traditional cleansing ceremony but has been adopted by the alternative health movement.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The rise of the global alternative health movement has seen the spread of many cultural rituals far from their origins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This is problematic as people may undertake such practices unaware of possible risks, steps in preparation or traditional dosages. One such practice is the use of Kambo as a cleansing ritual. Once localized to South America, it is now practiced internationally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department at Sunshine Coast University Hospital (Queensland, Australia) with severe chest and upper abdominal pain associated with protracted vomiting. This occurred after participating in a Kambo demonstration. Initial observations were normal (white cell count, 13.9 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), however, over the next 2 h he demonstrated signs of septic shock. Clinical assessment indicated subcutaneous emphysema of the neck. Concern for Boerhaave syndrome was raised, broad spectrum antibiotic including antifungal therapy was commenced, and a computerized tomography (CT) scan with oral contrast was ordered. The CT scan revealed a perforation at the left lateral aspect of the distal oesophagus with extravasation of contrast into a large posterior mediastinal collection . Urgent operative intervention involved a left posterolateral thoracotomy, revealing a defect in the distal oesophagus and a large mediastinal collection. The defect was closed with interrupted absorbable sutures and several large bore chest drains were placed . A concomitant venting gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy were placed to aid in early commencement of enteral nutrition. A contrast swallow at day 5 showed no ongoing leak, after which an oral diet was gradually recommenced. The patient was discharged 18 days post presentation. A follow-up endoscopy was performed at 3 months, which demonstrated a healed oesophagus.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Large posterior mediastinal fluid and gas collection containing contrast indicating Boerhaave.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Post operative chest X-ray with bilateral chest drains and residual subcutaneous emphysema.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Boerhaave Syndrome is an uncommon and potentially fatal condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology is forceful emesis with sudden elevation of intra-oesophageal pressures resulting in rupture of the oesophagus. In most cases there is no underlying abnormality to the oesophagus, however risk factors include alcoholism and binge eating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A classic triad (Macklers) has been described (chest pain, vomiting and subcutaneous emphysema), but is only present in 27% of presentations so a high degree of clinical suspicion is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Patient outcome is strongly dependent on time to diagnosis, as well as perforation site. A 2010 study based on 27 patients across the 2002–2006 period, showed that perforations treated within 24 h showed a 6% mortality rate, compared with a 40% mortality rate in those diagnosed after 24 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】This is the second published case of Boerhaave’s Syndrome due to Kambo use, and the first reported in Australia. In 2020, a 62-year-old woman in North America presenting with chest pain also demonstrated a rupture requiring surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Kambo originates from South America and is used as part of a cleansing ceremony. It is derived from secretions collected from the frog, _Phyllomedusa bicolor_ and has been found to contain several active peptides including phyllocaeruleins (hypotensive properties), tachykinins and phyllokinins (vasodilators), dermorphins and deltorphins (opiate like actions) and adenoregulins (antiboiotics properties) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The ritual describes drinking a large volume of water then applying Kambo to previously created burns, typically on the arm or thigh. Other complications of use include hepatitis, hyponatraemia and psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8–10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Our patient stated this was the second time he participated in this ritual. Whilst the first was out of curiosity, this occasion was part of a demonstration at a local centre. Both new (dark dots) and old scars are visible in Fig. 3 . He stated the material had been sourced from an international group promoting Kambo use.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Left deltoid Kambo administration site.

In this study, we presented a case showing signs of an acute abdomen with sharp rises in serum pancreatic biochemical markers during the treatment of DKA with pyelonephritis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed to confirm the onset of acute pancreatitis; however, pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement of the rectal wall were detected, indicating the presence of rectal infarction. Hartmann’s procedure was immediately performed, and histological examination of the resected specimen revealed gangrenous ischaemic colitis. The present case highlights DKA as a risk factor of ischaemic colitis and the role of contrast-enhanced CT in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Ischaemic colitis occurs when there is a transient or sustained compromise in blood flow that fails to meet the metabolic needs of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This leads to mucosal ulceration, inflammation, haemorrhage and eventually bowel infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Different types of ischaemic colitis, including transient colitis, chronic ulcerative colitis with or without stricture, and gangrenous colitis, are differentiated based on their clinical course and severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Gangrenous colitis has a high mortality rate of up to 40% and requires urgent surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) plays a critical role in the development of ischaemic colitis due to mesenteric collapse as it results in a serious reduction of fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We herein describe a patient with gangrenous ischaemic colitis who presented with an acute abdomen during an episode of DKA that was difficult to differentially diagnose from acute pancreatitis, which is also a common comorbidity of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man who had been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidaemia and spinocerebellar degeneration with orthostatic dysregulation, dysarthria, neurogenic bladder and faecal incontinence at a local clinic was referred to our department for inadequate glycaemic control with impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale E2V1M4). On admission to the emergency room, he had a body temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure of 84/56 mm Hg, pulse of 104 bpm and respiration rate of 24 breaths/min. Physical examination showed clear lungs and no cardiac murmurs on chest auscultation, non-palpable liver and spleen, decreased bowel sounds, no abdominal distension, mass or bruit, and no oedema in the extremities. Laboratory examination showed high levels of fasting plasma glucose (1500 mg/dl) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 10.6%). DKA was diagnosed based on the detection of metabolic acidaemia (pH 7.209) with an increased anion gap (27.7 mEq/L) due to high serum ketone levels (4.04 mmol/L). Urinalysis revealed that the urine was macroscopically cloudy, and urinary occult blood, ketone, and sugar were strongly positive. Leukocytosis (27.1 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with predominant neutrophils (92.0%), high serum C-reactive protein levels (4.54 mg/dl), and pyuria with leukocytes ≥10/high power field in the urinary sediment were suggestive of concomitant pyelonephritis. Biochemistry analysis indicated a marked increase in serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (139.2 mg/dL), creatinine (5.10 mg/dL), potassium (7.7 mEq/L), creatinine kinase (CK 3480 IU/L) with predominant CK-MM isozyme (BB 0%, MB 2%, MM 98%), and myoglobin levels (10 899 IU/L) representing renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities and rhabdomyolysis. The electrocardiogram reflected the patient’s hyperkalaemic status with a marked high-peaked T wave in leads V <sub>2–4 </sub> and wide QRS complexes in all leads. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) analysis on arrival revealed no significant findings in the head, chest, abdomen or intrapelvis .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography of the intrapelvis showed no apparent abnormalities on admission (A and B), but revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement in the rectal wall on Day 2 of hospitalization (C and D, _arrow_ ).</u>\n\n【7】Treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of isotonic saline (0.9% saline solution) and regular insulin was initiated after the diagnosis of DKA, but haemodialysis was not performed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was also intravenously administered after blood and urine cultures were obtained. Streptococcus species were detected with a bacterial count of ≥10 <sup>5 </sup> colony-forming units/ml in the urine culture test. Streptococcus, a weak pathogen, accounts for only 1–2% of causative bacteria of urinary tract infections. However, the patient had poorly controlled DM and neurogenic bladder, which could have contributed to the development of streptococcal-related pyelonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The results of multiple blood cultures were negative for bacteraemia. For DKA, plasma glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in capillary blood were corrected to 378 mg/dl and 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, 18 hours after the initiation of treatment. Serum potassium levels were dropped to 5.7 mEq/L, which almost normalized the electrocardiogram findings at that time. However, the treatment failed to ameliorate renal failure as serum BUN and creatinine remained high, i.e. 128.3 mg/dl and 5.22 mg/dl, respectively. Impaired consciousness and haemodynamic instability continued, and diffuse distension and rigidity of the abdomen were newly observed. Intestinal peristalsis remained diminished, and no melena was observed. Serum pancreatic biochemical markers that were normal at the time of admission (amylase 98 IU/L) rose remarkably (amylase 1026 IU/L, pancreatic type amylase 1013 IU/L, and lipase 1201 IU/L). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed to elucidate coexisting acute pancreatitis, which revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poorly enhanced bowel walls of the rectum , but no evidence of severe pancreatitis was found. There were no mesenteric artery and venous occlusion due to emboli and thrombosis.\n\n【8】The patient underwent Hartmann’s procedure, including segmental resection of the rectum and sigmoid colostomy formation. The resected rectum was clearly demarcated from the non-necrotic area and the necrotic mucosa was a circumferential lesion . Histological examination of the specimen revealed typical findings of gangrenous ischaemic colitis, such as coagulative mucosal necrosis, submucosal haemorrhage and necrotising muscle layer infiltrated with numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils . The patient recovered uneventfully after surgery and subsequent rehabilitation practices, and he has then maintained proper glycaemic control (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 5.9–6.3%) with oral glucose-lowering agents and normal renal function for 2 years after being discharged.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|(A) Gross appearance of the resected specimen revealed an entire circumferential necrotic lesion of the rectal mucosa. The lesion had a relatively clear border and several linear and map-like mucosal ulcerations in the non-necrotic region. Histopathological examination of the resected rectum revealed (B) a lesion with clear demarcation from the area of unaltered crypt architecture, and (C) sloughing of the epithelium with loss of ductal epithelial cells (ghost-like appearance) .

Of these, the patient had four risk factors: older age (61 years), hypoalbuminaemia (2.9 g/dl) and a history of hypertension and T2DM. His abnormal bowel habits including recurrent constipation and diarrhoea due to spinocerebellar degeneration might have increased the visceral intraluminal pressure, leading to worsened bowel wall ischaemia.\n\n【12】The CK isozyme CK-BB is found in the mucosa and muscularis throughout the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. After intestinal infarction, serum CK-BB levels immediately rise, peak at 6 hours, and rapidly drop within 24 hours, even in the presence of progressive irreversible bowel infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case, serum CK-BB isozyme was not detected at the time of admission; therefore, bowel infarction was likely to be initiated after hospitalization. Clinically, ischaemic colitis frequently occurs in the descending and sigmoid colon rather than in the rectum as the three arteries (right and left iliac arteries, and the superior rectal artery) supply blood to the rectum. This characteristic rectal circulation might have contributed to the slow progression of ischaemic colitis before the intestine became gangrenous during his hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【13】Acute pancreatitis occurs in 11% of adults with DKA, whereas non-specific elevations in serum amylase and lipase levels are observed in 40% of DKA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. High serum amylase levels are also associated with bowel infarction, and the magnitude of hyperamylasaemia is related to the degree of infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, bowel infarction and acute pancreatitis may show similar clinical picture, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the two based solely on pancreatic biochemical marker values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This case supports the finding that contrast-enhanced CT imaging should be considered in DKA patients to exclude acute pancreatitis when serum amylase levels rise more than three times the normal upper limits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】In conclusion, clinical course and laboratory findings in DKA patients may be non-specific to distinguish severe ischaemic colitis from other intra-abdominal diseases, including acute pancreatitis. Evaluation of contrast-enhanced CT imaging may provide useful information for prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of intestinal ischaemia in order to achieve a favourable outcome.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Yuichi Kataoka (Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan) for his collaboration.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The present case report meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hiroaki Iwasaki.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We performed early and prompt reperfusion and were able to save the patient without any complications. A wrap-around LAD perfuses a large myocardial area; therefore, this type of coronary occlusion causes severe myocardial damage and has a poor prognosis. The rates of new-onset heart failure and heart failure rehospitalization are also high. Simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevations on electrocardiography suggest acute myocardial infarction with a wrap-around LAD lesion, which requires prompt revascularization. More careful medications for heart failure and follow-up should be also required even after discharge in such case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Generally, left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion results in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Inferior leads are reciprocal to precordial leads; therefore, simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation in myocardial infarction is rare. Here, we describe inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction due to a large wrap-around LAD occlusion.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old man had sudden chest pain. One hour later, he was admitted to our emergency department. The patient’s past medical history included hyperuricemia, ureterolithiasis and current smoking. On admission, his blood pressure was 98/58 mmHg; pulse rate, 51 beats/min and oxygen saturation, 96% (mask, 3 L). The patient had no murmurs or respiratory rales and was experiencing cold sweats. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V2-6  along with complete right-bundle branch block (CRBBB). Echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with anteroseptal and inferior wall motion abnormalities. Initially, we expected simultaneous occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and LAD. Emergency coronary angiography (CAG) showed proximal LAD occlusion , a normal left circumflex artery and a small RCA . Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the LAD was performed. The thrombus was aspirated using an aspiration catheter (Thrombuster, KANEKA, Japan) after wire crossing. An everolimus-eluting stent (EES: 3.5 × 18 mm) was placed. During the procedure, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation. We performed defibrillation four times, and his ECG returned to sinus rhythm. CAG after successful stenting revealed large LAD wrapping around the apex to the inferior wall . Immediately after PCI, we inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for continuation of cardiac shock. The door-to-balloon time was approximately 40 min. While creatinine kinase (CK) levels peaked at 12 079 U/L (normal: 40–200 U/L), CK-MB peaked at 220 U/L (normal: <25 U/L). The patient’s postoperative course was favorable. On day 3 post admission, the IABP was removed for hemodynamic stabilization. Heart failure did not develop during hospitalization. On day 11 postadmission, the patient was discharged without complications. He was able to return to work. After 3 years, CAG revealed no restenosis , and ECG showed disappearance of the CRBBB and improvement in ST-segment elevation . Echocardiography revealed residual anteroseptal wall motion abnormalities; however, the ejection fraction was restored to 64%. During the several years following treatment, the patient experienced no further cardiovascular events.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Admission ECG showing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V2-6  along with CRBBB (black arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Initial CAG showing proximal LAD occlusion (red arrow).

CAG revealed an occlusion of only the LAD, which ran around the apex to the inferior wall and perfused both the inferior and anterior myocardium. An LAD that perfuses at least one-fourth of the inferior left ventricular wall in the right cranial oblique, is known as a wrap-around LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Bozbeyoğlu _et al_ . reported 88 patients (34.3%) with wrap-around LAD and 29 patients (11.5%) with ST-elevation in inferior leads among 259 patients with anterior AMI. Among the 29 patients, 13 patients (44.8%) had distal occlusion of wrap-around LAD, which was related to the cause of anterior AMI with ST-elevation in inferior leads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It results in a minor anterior myocardial injury, small reciprocal inferior ST-change and inferior myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although CAG revealed proximal occlusion of LAD in this case, the ECG of our patient revealed both inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation. This was a relatively rare case, and we considered the following: the patient had a small RCA and thus, LAD perfused a significant portion of the inferior myocardium. There was a larger change of the ST-elevation than that of ST-depression inferior segments. This type of LAD perfuses a larger portion of the myocardium; therefore, wrap-around LAD occlusion may result in severe myocardial damage compared with that of non-wrap-around LAD occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Kobayashi _et al._ reported a high mortality and morbidity in patients with occluded wrap-around LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The rates of new-onset heart failure and heart failure rehospitalization are also high. Medications should be managed and careful follow-up is required, even after discharge. Our patient’s ECG also showed CRBBB, which resulted from an anterior myocardial infarction involving the interventricular septum. Wong _et al_ . reported that the right-bundle branch traverses the intraventricular septum toward the cardiac apex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this case, the occluded lesion was proximal to a large septal branch. We considered that the proximal wrap-around LAD occlusion resulted in ischemia of the septum and the right-bundle branch and development of CRBBB. A poor prognosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with CRBBB has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The patient was saved due to early and prompt reperfusion. The possibility of wrap-around LAD lesions in simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevations should be considered. Large infarct area and high incidence of heart failure indicate a poor prognosis. Clinicians should note the need for rapid reperfusion and more careful medication for heart failure in such cases.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All relevant data are within the manuscript.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval for this single-case analysis was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Tokushima Red Cross Hospital.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study was published with written consent of the patient.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hiroto Tamura, MD (corresponding author).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of simultaneous multiple organs immature teratomas who was admitted to Razi hospital because of cough, dyspnea, and left-side supraclavicular mass. Computed tomography (CT) showed a big mass with multiple high densities, nodular, semi-solid, heterogenic structures on the left side of the neck, left-side anterior mediastinum, right-side middle mediastinum and right-side suprarenal region. CT-guided needle biopsy was performed and histopathological study showed immature teratoma. After performing neoadjuvant therapy, the tumors were removed. The patient underwent chemo radiation therapy on the mediastinum and abdomen. On 6-months follow-up, he was asymptomatic. This case is being reported because of the rarity of multiple organs immature teratomas and informing other clinicians about managing these cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Teratomas are germ cell tumors and commonly composed of multiple cells which derived from one or more of the three germ layers. They usually arise in the gonads. Only 1–3 % of all germ cell tumors arise in the mediastinum and they are account for 15 % of adult anterior mediastinal masses. They are equally presented in men and women between the ages of 1 and 70 years, the average age is 28-years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Germ cell tumors range from benign, well-differentiated or mature usually as cystic or solid lesions, and malignant or immature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We found only three cases of extra gonadal multiple organs immature teratomas- in ovary with mediastinum, liver with mediastinum, and in different parts of brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 – 7 \\]</u>. We report an extremely rare case of 26-year-old man with cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, neck mass and harboring synchronous immature teratomas in his left side of neck, left-side anterior mediastinum, right middle mediastinum and abdomen.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 26-year-old man admitted to Razi hospital with cough, dyspnea and left-side neck mass . Physical examination revealed a multi lobulated, firm mobile and non-tender mass in the left side of neck. Physical examination of other organs was normal. Chest X-ray showed a mass in anterior and right middle mediastinum. Ultrasound of abdomen showed a large nonhomogeneous mass measuring approximately 20 cm × 18 cm × 8 cm seen in the right upper quadrant and extending to the sub hepatic region. Biochemical testes were normal. AFP (Alfa Feto Protein), CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) and B-HCG (Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) values were normal. Computerized tomography (CT) of neck, chest and abdomen revealed a multiple lobulated mass in left side of neck, a well encapsulated solid mass lesion 12 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm in the left anterior mediastinum and another mass in the right middle mediastinum in the right sub-carina region and a mass in the right side of abdomen. All masses lesions were heterogeneous with predominant fat density and no signs of chest wall or pericardial invasion or focal calcification . Ultrasounds of testis, pelvic and inguinal regions were normal. Core needle biopsy of the neck, left mediastinum and abdomen masses was done by CT guided. Diagnosis was immature teratoma. Oncology consultation was performed and neoadjuvant therapy had been done with Etoposide, Ifsofamid and Cisplatin according to their recommendations. Twenty days after neoadjuvant therapy, neck dissection was done and all masses were removed completely . Histopathological examination of three lesions showed immature cystic teratomas . After four weeks—with median laparotomy—a large sub hepatic mass which extending from liver up to right kidney, adherent to aorta, kidney and inferior vena cava, was excised with small residue on the aorta and inferior vena cava. Histopathological examination of mass showed an immature teratoma . Patient underwent chemo radiation therapy on the mediastinum and abdomen. He had an uneventful post-operative period recovery, and on 6-months follow-up, he was asymptomatic.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Neck mass.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|CT scan of neck showing an ill-defined lobulated mass in the left side of neck.

They are commonly classified benign or mature and frankly malignant or immature. This classification is on the basis of the presence of neuroectodermal elements within the tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Malignant teratomas usually have more immature elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Only 5% of all teratomas occur in the head and neck region, predominantly in the cervical region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. Cervical teratomas are almost always benign and congenital in children, but they may be locally aggressive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Abdominal and pelvic immature teratomas are very rare in adults. Immature abdominopelvic extra gonadal teratomas are rare and most frequently occur in middle-aged females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. They usually occur in the presacral space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, but can also arise in the ischiorectal space and perineum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. Our case was a 26-year-old man who had immature teratomas which were not congenital. Teratomas can present with respiratory distress. In these cases, immediate excision is required and surgery is curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In presented case, total excision neck and mediastinum masses were performed . Teratomas in the thoracic cavity usually occur in the anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. In an analysis of 142 cases of teratomas in childhood, all the 14 mediastinal teratomas were in the anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Symptoms are related to their mechanical effects: including chest pain, cough, dyspnea, recurrent pneumonitis and hemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>, but our case presented only dyspnea.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 9:|删除段之间换行|Showing mass during surgery.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 10:|删除段之间换行|Showing mass after surgery.</u>\n\n【18】Mediastinal teratomas are also often asymptomatic and occasionally discovered incidentally on chest radiograph 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 9 \\]</u>. Usually in benign teratomas, AFP and B-HCG are normal and elevated levels may be indicative of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. In our case, these markers were in normal ranges. CT usually reveals complex appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging can differentiate teratoma from others mediastinal cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Radiological differential diagnoses of teratoma are lymphangioma, venous malformations with phleboliths, dermoid, neurenteric cysts, tornwaldt cyst and basal meningocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Mature teratomas are removed by simple cystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. If immature elements are found, the patient should undergo a standard staging procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 4 \\]</u>. The treatment of mature and immature teratomas is predominantly complete surgical excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.

Once a very common practice among faith healers in rural India, in the modern-day practice of medicine, we seldom encounter patients who have been exposed to this anecdotal practice for analgesia. A 51-year-old male was admitted to a tertiary care center in Western India for the management of newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma. On clinical examination, he was found to have well-healed, uniformly spaced scar marks on the anterior abdominal wall. On being asked, he admits that, as a child, he used to have recurrent episodes of colicky abdominal pain for which he underwent multiple sessions of heated iron rod application on the anterior abdominal wall as advised by a faith healer in his village. He had temporary relief from pain only to have a recurrence a few weeks later, which prompted them to have multiple sessions of the procedure. Through these images , we intend to acquaint young doctors with such practices, which were prevalent in our society, and thus widen their perspective about alternative forms of therapeutic practices.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Well healed scar marks from branding with a hot iron rod, on the anterior abdominal wall.</u>\n\n【2】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【3】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【4】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【5】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She deteriorated rapidly due to haemodynamic compromise from suspected bleeding and suffered a cardiac arrest with prolonged resuscitation. Emergency thoracotomy demonstrated an acute longitudinal tear of the innominate artery/brachiocephalic trunk at the junction of the subclavian and common carotid arteries. This is the first reported case of spontaneous arterial rupture in a patient with systemic sclerosis, and while direct causation is difficult to prove, her history of previous vascular complications with potential ongoing microvascular damage makes a contributory role likely.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】We present the case of a 57-year-old female who presented in extremis to our emergency department with an acute onset of right upper chest and neck pain with swelling, immediately after bending down in her garden. She had a background of systemic sclerosis complicated by a renal crisis 15 years previously, for which she was on mycophenolate mofetil maintenance therapy. She also had rectal carcinoma in 2016 with subsequent abdominoperineal resection and end-colostomy formation.\n\n【4】After developing dyspnoea within minutes, she was transported to hospital via ambulance where her neck swelling worsened, causing hypoxia and cardio-respiratory arrest. Endotracheal intubation was not possible due to severe tracheal deviation, and an emergency surgical tracheostomy was performed. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 60 minutes, with multiple instances of loss of cardiac output in the interim. She continued to bleed profusely from her tracheostomy site and was transferred to theatre immediately for emergency surgery due to suspicion of ongoing active bleeding within the upper chest. Clamshell thoracotomy was performed which revealed an acute longitudinal tear of the innominate artery/brachiocephalic trunk at the junction of the subclavian and common carotid arteries. This was successfully repaired; however, the patient died on the intensive care unit 48 hours later of multi-organ failure and hypoxic brain injury.\n\n【5】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【6】Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-mediated disorder resulting in fibrosis of the skin and internal organs as well as a fibroproliferative vasculopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Changes in the microvasculature and endothelium are a prominent feature of SSc, but macrovascular changes related to atherosclerosis can be accelerated as in other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, leading to a higher mortality risk from cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Arterial aneurysms and dissections have been occasionally reported in SSc patients, with focal arteritis affecting small and medium sized vessels thought to be the underlying pathogenesis for aneurysmal changes in connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Long-term steroid usage may have a contributory role in vascular fragility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and there is a suggestion that prolonged steroid use may lead to disintegration of the intima media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Intracranial aneurysms have been reported in the context of CREST syndrome; however, these vessels may be particularly susceptible to focal changes due to the lack of perivascular support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Non-traumatic innominate artery rupture is an extremely rare event. Certain conditions may predispose to this outcome including aneurysms from degenerative arterial disease, Takayasu’s disease, Marfan’s syndrome and syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Invasive infection, radiotherapy, malignant invasion and heritable vascular conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may also predispose to rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous arterial rupture in a patient with systemic sclerosis. Our patient did not have any of the above risk factors and aneurysmal disease was not found at the time of surgical repair. Tracheostomy can lead to innominate artery injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> but is unlikely to be the cause here given the nature of presentation and pronounced haemodynamic compromise prior to insertion. Whilst direct causation from her systemic sclerosis is difficult to prove, her history of previous vascular complications in the form of a renal crisis along with potential ongoing microvascular damage, in the absence of known risk factors for spontaneous rupture, makes a contributory role to her fatal outcome likely.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare we have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this article.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Written_ consent for publication has been obtained from the next of kin.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Sabreen Ali.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The symptoms are not specific and are often severe and abrupt; therefore, patients are sometimes diagnosed as having surgical abdomen. The clinical imaging findings are remarkable, including ascites, enteritis, ileus, eosinophilic granuloma and sometimes perforation. We experienced a case of intestinal anisakiasis diagnosed on the basis of the _Anisakis_ \\-specific immunoglobulin A level from paired sera and treated successfully with conservative therapy, although ileum perforation was complicated by a 50-mm abscess. Even the large abscess could be treated without drainage in this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Anisakiasis is a parasitic disease in humans caused by the incidental ingestion of _Anisakis_ larvae, which are present in fresh fish and squid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. When the larvae stick to the gastrointestinal membrane and cause various kinds of symptoms, the status is termed as anisakiasis. According to the location where the _Anisakis_ larvae are stuck to the human body, anisakiasis is categorized into gastric, intestinal and ectopic anisakiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In a series of 15 715 cases of anisakiasis reported in Japan, the proportions of the categories were as follows: gastric anisakiasis, 95.6%; intestinal anisakiasis, 4.1%; and ectopic anisakiasis, 0.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The clinical imaging findings in intestinal anisakiasis are remarkable, including ascites, enteritis, ileus, eosinophilic granuloma and sometimes perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Patients with intestinal perforations or strangulation normally require surgical therapy, but conservative therapy can be the treatment option in anisakiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Cases of nongastric anisakiasis are not only rare but also difficult to diagnose because the small intestine is unreachable by a regular endoscope, although detecting the whole worm visually is the hallmark of the diagnostic procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. As a result, patients with intestinal anisakiasis diagnosed as acute abdomen or intestinal obstructions might undergo unnecessary surgical operations. Here, we describe an anisakiasis case that was correctly diagnosed clinically and treated successfully with conservative therapy, although the patient developed a 50-mm abscess but without percutaneous drainage.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 36-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe abdominal pain. He had been well until the day before admission, when he had severe abdominal pain and several vomiting episodes with fever of 37.5°C. He had eaten sliced raw salmon 12 h before the onset. He denied diarrhea, and his past medical history was unremarkable. He did not smoke or drink. On physical examination, his abdomen showed diminished bowel sound and severe tenderness on the lower portion, with rebound tenderness (Blumberg’s sign) and no rigidity. The findings from the remainder of the physical examination were unremarkable. Laboratory examination revealed severe leukocytosis of 20 900/μl with 90.2% neutrophils and 1% eosinophils, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (22.3 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen (25 mg/dl) and creatinine (0.73 mg/dl). Other blood screening test results and the electrocardiogram were normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a small amount of ascites and enteritis without free air.\n\n【7】The patient was admitted under the diagnosis of severe enteritis and placed under fasting status. Blood and stool samples were taken before the administration of 2 g/day cefmetazole (Sankyo Co. Ltd) intravenously (IV) in two divided doses. On day 3, the patient had fever with a body temperature of 39.6°C, and the antibiotic was switched from cefmetazole to 2 g/day imipenem and cilastatin (Sawai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) IV in four divided doses.\n\n【8】On day 7, the blood and stool cultures were negative, and the fever subsided to 37.3°C. Nonetheless, the abdominal pain and leukocytosis of 12 300/μl with 85.1% neutrophils persisted. Abdominal echo revealed a 50-mm heterogeneous mass adjacent to the swollen ileum . A contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) revealed a typical abscess presenting as a 50-mm well-defined hypodense lesion with peripheral ring enhancement located next to the inflamed ileum . Percutaneous drainage was impossible because the abscess was located in the deep back side of the pelvis. The treatment options were open surgery or conservative treatment with current imipenem and cilastatin IV without drainage. The patient chose conservative treatment under adequate given information, as the symptoms were subsiding day by day.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal echo image showing a 50-mm heterogeneous mass adjacent to the swollen ileum .</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan showing a typical abscess finding of a 50-mm well-defined hypodense lesion with peripheral ring enhancing located next to the inflamed ileum .</u>\n\n【11】The test result for _Anisakis_ \\-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) on day 6 was negative (0.41 I/U; normal range <1.50 I/U), but that with paired sera on day 37 revealed an elevated value of 1.51 I/U. On day 15, the patient gradually resumed oral intake because his abdominal pain was gone. His white blood cell count became normal (7900/μl), and abdominal echo revealed that the abscess had shrunk to 20 mm in diameter. The IV antibiotics were discontinued on day 16. The patient was discharged on day 23 after the confirmation that increasing diet did not aggravate the symptom. The abscess shrunk to 10 mm on day 37.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Anisakiasis can be confirmed by detecting the morphological characteristics of the whole worm on endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Different from gastric anisakiasis, intestinal anisakiasis is difficult to diagnose because the small intestine is an inaccessible zone for endoscopy. The patient’s history of eating sliced raw salmon made us suspect anisakiasis. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of _Anisakis_ \\-specific IgA antibody level in the paired sera. The paired sera taken several weeks from the first test were effective for the diagnosis, with a reported sensitivity of ~70% if the test is performed early after onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】A 50-mm abscess appeared without free air and pan-peritonitis, presumably because of the perforation in the mesentery side in this case. Although abscess should be treated with a combination of drainage and antibiotics, the patient was treated only with antibiotics owing to the location of the abscess precluding percutaneous drainage. Remarkably, even an abscess as large as 50 mm could be successfully treated without drainage in this case. The abscess shrunk to less than half its original size just after 1 week and to 10 mm after 1 month, presumably because the internal fistulation connected the abscess and the ileum.\n\n【15】Intestinal anisakiasis cannot be suspected even with detailed medical history taking along, as the symptoms are nonspecific; even CECT cannot detect it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As a result, some patients with intestinal anisakiasis have undergone surgical exploration after diagnosis of acute abdomen or intestinal obstruction.

Single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy prior to 22 weeks of gestation has been reported to be strongly correlated with double twin demise. To our knowledge, there are no case reports on the natural course of a surviving co-twin in an MM twin pregnancy resulting in live birth after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation. Here, we report a case of a surviving co-twin, after a single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation in a MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage leading to porencephaly, and live birth at 36 weeks of gestation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Monochorionic monoamniotic (MM) twin pregnancy is the least common type of twin pregnancy and carries a high risk of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Single IUFD in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is a devastating condition for the surviving co-twin due to acute fetal hypovolemia and anemia through blood transfusion from the surviving fetus into the demised fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Previous studies have suggested that almost all single IUFDs that occur prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy have been reported to result in double twin demise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 4 \\]</u>. Here, we report on an extremely rare case of a surviving co-twin after single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation due to cord entanglement in an MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage, resulting in porencephaly and live birth.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 33-year-old female, gravida 2, para 2, was referred to our hospital for the management of an MM twin pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. At 20 weeks of gestation, the entanglement of the umbilical cords was observed on ultrasound. At 21 weeks of gestation, IUFD of one fetus was confirmed and the surviving fetus displayed mild hydrops fetalis with the findings of subcutaneous edema and pleural effusion. Increased middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was observed (42 cm/s: >1.5 MoM), suggesting that acute anemic status caused by blood transfusion from the surviving fetus to the demised fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Serial counseling was provided for the mother and her family regarding the expected poor prognosis of the surviving co-twin and the possibility of severe neurological impairment and double IUFD; however, the mother chose to continue with the pregnancy.\n\n【6】At 23 weeks of gestation, the hydropic changes of the surviving fetus disappeared. However, atrophy of cerebral parenchyma with an enlarged posterior horn of the lateral ventricle was observed. At 26 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus revealed severe ventriculomegaly, atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum . Additionally, at 26 weeks of gestation, oligohydramnios with amniotic fluid index (AFI; normal range: 5–25 cm) of 1.8 cm acutely emerged. At 30 weeks of gestation, bilateral renal hypoplasia became apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> . Interestingly, the volume of the amniotic fluid started to increase gradually from 28 weeks of gestation up to AFI of 15 cm at 34 weeks of gestation . With regard to the fetal growth, the growth in the size of the head was almost arrested from 22 weeks of gestation; however, it started to increase again from 28 weeks of gestation .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|MRI of the fetal head at 25 weeks of gestation.

The live male infant had a weight of 2775 g with an Apgar score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Seven days after the birth, a head MRI revealed the characteristic findings of microcephaly and porencephaly . Additionally, bilateral renal hypoplasia was also apparent \\[long axis length of right/left kidney: 18 mm/31 mm (normal range: 39–51 mm)\\] 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Two days after the birth, the serum creatinine level was 1.44 mg/dl; however, it spontaneously decreased to 0.80 mg/dl at 11 days after birth. The general condition of the infant was good, and the infant was discharged 12 days after the birth without any medication. The infant is currently under follow-up and has only slight rigidity in the limbs, predominantly on the left side, at 3 months of age .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|Transition of biparietal diameter (BPD).

In our case, the surviving fetus displayed not only neurological damage resulting in porencephaly, but also bilateral renal hypoplasia, which were speculated to be caused by acute detrimental circulatory changes on the brain and kidneys after single IUFD. To our knowledge, there have been no case reports that describe the antenatal course of a surviving co-twin after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【15】Genova _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported that severe kidney failure was recognized in only 1 of 44 cases (2.3%) of single IUFD in monochorionic twin pregnancies. In our case, the surviving fetus exhibited signs of kidney failure from the severe oligohydramnios and renal hypoplasia seen on ultrasound. It is noteworthy that the volume of the amniotic fluid started to increase continuously from 28 weeks of gestation up to a normal range. One possible explanation for this change is that the fetal renal function might be gradually ameliorated because of the recovery from aberrant circulatory status of acute blood loss and hypovolemia as a result of single IUFD. Additionally, it is speculated that a certain number of nephrons were still preserved even if bilateral kidneys were morphologically impaired, which is supported by the fact that a blood creatinine level spontaneously decreased after birth. Our case provides valuable evidence that severe renal damage during the fetal period could recover, resulting in a live birth. However, it is difficult to predict the long-term prognosis given the short 3-month follow-up. Further close attention to renal function is necessary to assess the risk of chronic kidney disease later in life.\n\n【16】In conclusion, this is a case report on a surviving fetus with an extremely rare clinical course after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy. The important aspect of this case is that a monoamniotic twin not only survived after early demise of its co-twin but also demonstrated recovery of renal function in the neonatal period despite the prenatal diagnosis of bilateral renal hypoplasia. We feel that this case report provides valuable information to enable both obstetricians and patients to make informed choice and furthers the understanding of the fetal pathophysiological changes after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

MBC was formally considered a distinct pathological pattern by WHO classification of breast tumors in 2000. We report the case of a 49-year-old Syrian female who presented to our hospital due to a painful huge mass in her right breast. Radiographic and clinical findings were highly indicative of breast carcinoma. Therefore, a core needle biopsy was performed, and surprisingly, microscopic examination suggested the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, whereas immune stains confirmed the diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma.

In this article, we introduce a challenging case that clarifies the characteristics of this malignancy and the methods we used in diagnosing, examining and treating it.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】We report the case of a 49-year-old Syrian female, who was admitted to our hospital due to a painful huge lump in her right breast that had rapidly enlarged in the last 2 months without any signs of skin changes or nipple discharge. The patient denied any history of trauma, but she underwent a surgery to remove a benign ovarian cyst 15 years ago. In addition, her medical and family history were insignificant. Physical examination revealed a painful firm mass in the medial half of her right breast with painful nodular formations beside the areola and in the right axilla. Laboratory findings showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas all other results were normal. Breast ultrasonography (US)  showed a hypoechoic lobulated mass with heterogeneous content measuring 14 cm in diameter, localized in the medial half of the right breast, along with another nodular formation near the areola and two enlarged lymph nodes at the right axillary region. Pleural US revealed mild bilateral pleural effusion. Abdominal US was normal. Chest computed tomography (CT)  showed a tumor infiltrating the chest wall with a metastatic lesion in her right lung, whereas abdominal and pelvic CTs were normal. Consequently, radiographic and clinical findings were highly suggestive of breast carcinoma, which was our primary differential diagnosis. Therefore, the patient underwent a core needle biopsy, which revealed a specimen consists of seven soft to rubbery white-yellowish, ivory-white cores of tissue ranging from 6 to 15 mm length. Microscopic exam revealed heterologous epithelioid and spindle components including myxoid, chondroid, osseous and fibrous differentiations , with a wide range of atypia, extending from minimal atypia to frankly malignant. In addition to high-grade spindle cell lesion  with pleomorphic nuclei and occasional mitotic figures, including atypical mitoses, there were also foci of necrosis. These findings correlate with breast sarcoma, but immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for vimentin (VIM) , P63 , CK5/6  and pancytokeratin (Pan-CK) , whereas ER, PR and HER2 were all negative, Ki67 ~ 30% , which in turn, ruled out the breast sarcoma and confirmed the diagnosis of MBC. Clinical TNM stage of T4N1M1 was given. Based on the radiological and clinical findings, as well as the advanced tumor stage, which all indicate a poor prognosis, radical mastectomy and chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin were performed as a palliative treatment. Then the patient will be monitored at periodic intervals of 3 months for the first 2 years.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Breast US shows a hypoechoic lobulated mass with heterogeneous content, measuring 14 cm in diameter.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest CT shows a high-density mass in the right breast infiltrating the chest wall, accompanied with a metastatic lesion in the right lung.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Tumor nests interspersed with chondromyxoid matrix (hematoxylin and eosin \\[H&E\\] ×400).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Metaplastic carcinoma composed of high-grade spindle cells with angulated hyperchromatic nuclei in a collagenous stroma.

It has a unique IHC pattern includes positivity of VIM and Pan-CK and negativity of ER, PR and Her2neu 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The 2011 WHO classified MBC into the following subtypes: low-grade adeno-squamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, MBC with mesenchymal differentiation, spindle cell carcinoma and fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma, noticing that a large portion of MBCs reveal a mixture of different elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A cohort study showed that the most common subtype was matrix-producing carcinoma, followed by squamous and spindle cell carcinomas, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases present with rapidly growing masses >2 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and very few ones present with axillary lymph nodes metastases with an incidence ranging from 6 to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Most cases had patients with a median age extending from 48 to 59 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, with a median size of 3 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Studies revealed that the accurate diagnosis of MBC is low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. So that, patients with MBCs tend to be diagnosed with a higher tumor stage except for fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, which are usually detected at early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Sonography demonstrates a heterogeneous, hypoechoic solid mass or a mass with a mixture of cystic and solid compounds as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Histologically, the primary differential diagnosis includes myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma and adenomyoepithelioma. In contrast with MBCs subtypes with squamous differentiation, mesenchymal subtypes require IHC staining to be differentiated from breast sarcoma. The mesenchymal subtypes have co-expression of mesenchymal (VIM) and epithelial cell (CK) markers, which distinguish it from breast sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, MBCs show more benign features comparing to invasive ductal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We should keep in mind that it is essential to differentiate MBC from phyllodes tumor, which has a leaf-like growth pattern in addition to negativity of CK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The main treatment of MBC is surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and despite being a chemo-resistant tumor, chemotherapy is administered in 53.4–73.1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In conclusion, our case revealed a tumor characterized by a large size on presentation, which rapidly enlarged in a short period of time, accompanying with metastatic lesions seen in the nearby structures such as the lung and the axillary lymph nodes, as well as a triple negative pattern and a sarcoma-like pattern on microscopic exam; leading to sub-optimal response to systemic therapies. On the other hand, palliative treatment was performed due to the very poor prognosis.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Self-funding.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable for case reports at our institution.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We had a written consent from the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Zuheir Alshehabi is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Even though it is traditionally linked with hormonal influence, it can also develop in extrauterine organs with a slight female predominance. It is indistinguishable with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) histologically. We report a case of a 30-year-old gentleman who presented with a huge painful mass in the right iliac fossa. Computed tomography revealed a 10 × 10 cm homogeneous mass arising from the terminal ileum; he subsequently underwent an open right hemicolectomy. Histology showed a well-circumscribed lesion composed of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle fibres of the submucosa with positive smooth muscle actin and H-Caldesmon stains but negative for DOG-1 and CD117 (c-kit) stains which were consistent with leiomyoma. Despite its rarity, this hormone-related tumour needs to be considered regardless of gender. Immunohistochemistry is paramount as it is histologically identical to GIST.\n\n【2】case report , hemicolectomy , ileum , leiomyoma\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Leiomyoma is a benign tumour that can arise in any soft tissue sites most commonly in the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The extrauterine cause is rare with gastrointestinal leiomyoma most often found in the oesophagus, stomach and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Leiomyoma of the duodenum is the rarest among all gastrointestinal leiomyomas which is then followed by the ileum. This tumour is classified as mesenchymal neoplasms of gastrointestinal tract which are divided into two groups: gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) and other smooth muscle tumours. The latter group consists of a spectrum of diseases such as lipomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumors, schwannomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There has been a shift in nomenclature to separate GISTs from the smooth muscle tumours due to the discovery of expression of an KIT protein in GISTs by immunohistochemistry in the late 1990s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Smooth muscle tumours are most commonly encountered in middle-aged patients and have a slight female predominance (ratio 1.3:1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a 30-year-old male who presented with a painful right iliac fossa mass, diagnosed as an intestinal leiomyoma following surgical resection.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 30-year-old gentleman with a history of laparoscopic appendicectomy 7 years ago presented to a surgical clinic with a painful right iliac fossa mass for 3 weeks. He was otherwise well and denied any bowel or constitutional symptoms. On examination, there was a 10 × 10 cm tender, firm, mobile, globular mass in the right iliac fossa with no overlying skin changes. No lymph node enlargement was appreciated.\n\n【7】Blood investigations were unremarkable. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a homogeneous oval-shaped soft tissue mass (HU 50-80) arising from the terminal ileum . The mass was 9.8 × 9.0 × 10.4 cm in size with specks of fat within and without calcification. It extended anteriorly and abutted the posterior margin of the right rectus abdominis muscle. The radiological features were suggestive of ileal GIST.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) Axial CT image shows homogenous mass ( <sup>* </sup> ) extending anteriorly abuting the posterior margin of the right rectus abdominis muscle.

However, random biopsies of the terminal ileal wall were obtained and the histopathological report was normal. Terminal ileal GIST was suspected and the patient was prepared for limited right hemicolectomy via a laparoscopic approach. Conversion to open surgery was done due to dense adhesions between the tumour and the anterior and lateral abdominal wall. Intra-operatively, a solid tumour of approximately 8 × 8 cm in size arising from the terminal ileum was resected together as a limited right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis . Post-operatively, he developed an anastomotic leak 5 days after his surgery and subsequently underwent a re-exploration surgery with the formation of a double-barrel stoma. He was discharged and was well at 1 month follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Hemicolectomy specimen with 8 × 8 cm tumour at the terminal ileum.

Clinical presentation depends on size and site of the lesion. Around 44–50% of leiomyomas are symptomatic and can present as intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage or intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Smaller lesions are usually found incidentally during surgery, radiological studies or endoscopy. The clinical presentation is similar to GISTs. Although 50% of these tumours are usually less than 5 cm, around 5% can grow to more than 15 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Diagnostic workup includes an endoscopic assessment of the gastrointestinal tract. However, as 63% of these tumours are extra-luminal and difficult to assess using conventional endoscopy, it may yield negative results as demonstrated in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. CT has been successful in detecting 89.5% of leiomyomas, and the tumours are usually homogeneous, low-attenuation masses with an endoluminal growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging enteroclysis and enterography are gaining acceptance as the initial imaging modality to investigate small-bowel diseases as the soft-tissue contrast is superior and the morphological information and functional information can also be obtained. It is difficult to differentiate GISTs and leiomyoma radiologically as their characteristics overlap as well as the anatomical origin. Other differential diagnoses include leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrohistiocytoma and schwannomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment should be guided by the pathological diagnosis; however, this is difficult to be obtained pre-operatively in practice. If the tumour histology is unknown, an intraoperative pathological diagnosis is recommended via frozen section 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, any suspicious colonic or terminal ileal pathology warrants a surgical resection following oncological outcomes.\n\n【17】Grossly, both leiomyoma and GISTs are typically well circumscribed tumours. Microscopically, both exhibit spindle cell morphology although a minority of GISTs have epithelioid morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although in our case there were no cytological atypia and no increase in mitosis, smooth muscle tumours of the small bowel larger than 10 cm have been found to have 33% risk of progressive disease warranting a follow-up of at least 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is clinically important to differentiate leiomyoma from GISTs as the latter is 40–50% malignant and these patients may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors. KIT (CD117) and GIST-1 (DOG-1) are established GISTs markers with 95% sensitivity. The discovery of KIT as the main proto-oncogene in GISTs necessitated the use of KIT inhibitors such as imatinib in the setting of metastatic or unresectable GISTs, or adjuvant therapy for high-risk disease, thus significantly improving recurrent free survival and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, the immunohistochemical tests were negative for both and were positive for the smooth muscle markers (actin and H-Caldesmon), which strongly suggest a leiomyoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Terminal ileum leiomyoma is a rare cause of acute abdomen. CT is a helpful tool to diagnose this entity. However, histopathological examination with adjunct immunohistochemistry is of paramount importance to distinguish between GIST or leiomyoma and benign or potential malignant diseases to guide further treatment.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the Director-General of Health Malaysia for his permission to publish this article as a case report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required for this report.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

Previous reports have described it as a useful tool in high risk patients in need of intravascular material resection. Here we present a unique and never reported case of AngioVac device thrombectomy use in a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and gastrointestinal bleed that contraindicated other thrombectomy therapies due to severe anemia and high bleeding risk. A brief literature review about this therapy and its main outcomes is presented to contextualize the reader and contribute to academic knowledge.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Right heart masses are considered a life-threatening condition due to a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Masses found to be thrombi are rare and have various etiologies such as thrombosed central veins or central venous catheter-associated masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Non-thrombotic causes are usually related to metastatic lesions from tumors of the liver, lungs, mediastinum and melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Admission electrocardiogram.</u>\n\n【5】Diagnosis is based on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), however its sensibility and specificity for differentiating between clots, myxomas, fibromas and fatty tissue is limited, hence, additional imaging is usually required, such as contrast perfusion transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or TEE. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan have similar sensitivity but greater specificity compared to TTE at defining the etiology of the cardiac mass and may be useful for differentiating between malignant, vascular and stromal tumors from thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Once the diagnosis is made, treatment is rapidly targeted with different therapies as pharmacological thrombolysis, surgical mechanical thrombectomy and mechanical catheter-directed therapies as the AngioVac device. Choosing among these methods is still debated, retrospective studies have shown that patients with PE and free floating intra-cardiac thrombus benefit from surgical thrombectomy as opposed to thrombolysis alone. In those cases where surgery is contraindicated, thrombolytic therapy alone is an option if there is not a high bleeding or distal embolization risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Patients who are not eligible for those therapies or have a large clot burden are candidates for catheter thrombectomy with AngioVAC device, a novel promising therapy but with little available published experience and evidence. Here we present the case of a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) treated with AngioVac device. A brief literature review has been included for knowledge contribution to the reader.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 29-year-old Guatemalan male with significant past medical history of end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis, hypertension and 5 years use of indwelling tunneled central venous catheter presented to the emergency room due to a 5-day clinical onset of black stools and 1 day of acute moderate chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath at rest and dizziness. Vital signs were only remarkable for a blood pressure of 182/103 mmHg. At physical examination head, neck, lungs, heart and abdomen were normal. No blood per rectum or melena was found. Bilateral 2+ lower extremity pitting edema was noted.\n\n【10】Laboratory reports showed positive Troponin-I consecutive results of 4.58—4.56—4.19 ng/L and severe acute anemia with Hemoglobin (HgB) of 5.4 g/dl, EKG showed sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, left anterior fascicular block, poor R wave progression and no ST-segment changes . TTE was ordered. Blood cultures were positive for _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ . The patient’s chart showed last HgB level of 10.4 g/l 15 days before in prior admission.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Apical four-chamber view showing thrombus in right atrium (arrow) with mobile element (asterisk).</u>\n\n【12】Patient was diagnosed with acute UGB and type II non-ST Elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) secondary to acute HgB drop and catheter related sepsis (six points by SOFA); he was subsequently started on pantoprazole drip, beta blocker, rosuvastatin and three packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusions were given. Anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants were held because of UGB and pneumatic compression was ordered. Hemodialysis continued as usual and erythropoietin was administered. Vancomycin was started for treatment of _S. epidermidis_ bacteremia and endoscopy showed no bleeding, erythema or inflammatory changes suggestive of gastritis or ulceration in the entire examined stomach.\n\n【13】TTE demonstrated normal LVEF with a highly mobile, irregularly shaped echodensity (2.7 cm in maximum diameter) inside the right atrium (RA), suggestive of a catheter-associated thrombus . Due to high risk of embolization and sudden death risk he was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and cardio-thoracic surgery (CTS) was consulted.\n\n【14】CTS performed percutaneous removal under general anesthesia with Angiovac device because of bleeding risk of open thrombectomy. Intra-operative TEE showed no residual valve abnormalities and no remaining thrombus. After procedure, there were no immediate complications and patient remained in Surgical ICU for monitoring; 1 day later patient was extubated uneventfully. Pathology revealed calcified thrombus and negative culture growth. Patient was started on heparin anticoagulation on post-op Day 2, which was later bridged to warfarin 5 mg daily. He was then transferred to medical floor on post-op Day 3 and started ambulating without difficulties. HgB level increased to 8.3 g/dl following one more transfusion of pRBC. Patient was then discharged following several persistently negative blood cultures to complete 2-week course of outpatient vancomycin. Catheter was replaced for a right femoral vein one and patient continued with previous three times a week dialysis regimen.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Parasternal right ventricular inflow view showing mobile thrombus (arrow).</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Introduced in 2009, the AngioVac device is a vacuum-assisted thrombectomy system designed for _en bloc_ removal of large clot burden while avoiding bleeding and hemolysis risks associated with fibrinolytics, surgery and rheolytic systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Here we present a case of AngioVac use considered clinically relevant as this appears to be the first case of its use in a patient with an acute contraindication to anticoagulation.\n\n【18】In our literature review, a total of 45 cases of AngioVac use for thrombus aspiration was obtained including 15 cases of a single center case reports published by Donaldson _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> in 2015. In those 45 cases, main clinical manifestation was dyspnea in 13 cases, followed by incidental finding of the thrombi in six cases and palpitations in five, which is consistent with this presented case. The initial diagnosis was made by TEE in seven cases, not specified in nine cases, CT scan and venogram in seven and four cases, respectively. Only three cases were initially diagnosed by TTE as the one reported here 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–11 \\]</u>. In 15 cases, neither the clinical manifestations nor diagnostic approach was described. No report described UGB as a clinical finding.\n\n【19】The obtained material was removed from the inferior vena cava (IVC) in more than half of the cases, 11 of these cases had extent to RA. Only eight cases were isolated RA thrombi of which just six were related to catheters, consistent with epidemiologic data about rarity of RA thrombosis and highlighting the importance of the presented case. Obtained material consisted of thrombi in 80% of the cases, the remaining was associated to malignancy or vegetation. Only four cases reported a failed procedure and complications were reported in six cases with one septic emboli case and hematomas for the remaining five. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–11 \\]</u>. Particularly, in the Donaldson _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> case report, 11 cases had post-procedural bleeding of which five needed transfusions due to overt bleeding, and an overall 87% of survival to discharge was reported, which suggests the AngioVac thrombectomy as an overall safe procedure for those high surgical risk patients.\n\n【20】A recent meta-analysis by Hameed _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> was presented in 2019 with promising outcomes of this therapy. In this study, a total of 182 cases of AngioVac use were analyzed, of which 101 corresponded to thrombus removal. Successful removal pooled rate was 80.5 and 32.4 for right atrium/inferior vena cava (RA/IVC) thrombi and PE, respectively. As similar to the previously described cases, the need of conversion to open surgery had a low rate, with 12.3 pooled rate for thrombi removal. However operative mortality pooled rate was 14.8 and 32.3 for RA/IVC thrombi and PE, respectively, which should be taken into consideration when treating PE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】All this being said, percutaneous thrombectomy with AngioVac device is a promising therapy, which needs more complex trials to evaluate specific outcomes and to answer questions such as precise indications and contraindications of this intervention as well as complication and failure rates. Available reports and recent meta-analysis suggest AngioVac thrombectomy as a viable option for those high surgical risk patients with an inspiring high successful and low mortality rates except for those patients with PE, in which outcomes seem to be worse with this therapy.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>To all the healthcare professionals who participated in the care of this case.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We, as authors, declare that no institution participated on funding of this project.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>As this manuscript is based on the compilation of clinical record data and no clinical conduct was determined by the existence of it, we as authors consider no ethical approval other than patient’s informed consent is required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient was informed about our desire to publish the case and after cautious explanation about the contents of the manuscript, informed consent was signed.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hernan Leonardo Vera-Sarmiento, as main author is the guarantor of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present an unusual case of a 37-year-old male presenting with neurologic signs of right parietal lobe infarction with evidence of vertebral artery dissection and persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomosis as a conduit for thromboembolism.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Stroke in the young goes against all expectation as its occurrence is more fitting for the more aged population. Cervical artery dissection, described as the splitting of the arterial wall of the carotid or vertebral artery, accounts for up to 20% of stroke in the young 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Vertebral artery dissections present half as many times as internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections with an annual incidence rate of 0.97 versus 1.72 per 100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both young and aged populations present with local symptoms of occipital headache and neck pain. However, they are exclusively different in neurological signs and symptoms with respect to the cerebral territories they supply. It is unusual for anterior circulation infarction to occur from a posterior circulation lesion, but is possible through an aberrant carotid-basilar anastomosis. As a result, the patient presents with features of vertebral artery embolism and dissection. There is only one case reported in the medical literature indicating an association with vertebral artery dissection in the presence of persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but there was no associated anterior circulation infarct. We report a patient with a right parietal ischemic infarct secondary to a left vertebral artery dissection and right PPTA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old right-handed Indo-Trinidadian male was accepted into the emergency department with acute left-sided weakness with numbness of left upper limb, sudden loss of consciousness, dizziness, dysphasia and blurred vision within 2 h of the onset of these symptoms. The patient had no medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart disease, immunocompromised states, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders or illicit drug use. Family history is positive for myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus. The history of most recent event was one of being seated at rest when there was a sudden onset of the presenting symptoms. There was no violent coughing nor sneezing, chiropractic activity, no trauma to the cervical spine nor falls.\n\n【6】He was conscious with no hemodynamic instability including systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats/min and temperature of 36.4°C. Neurological assessment revealed dysarthria, left-sided hemiparesis, loss of two-point discrimination in left upper extremity and right-sided facial paralysis. Review of other systems demonstrated no clinical significance. Laboratory findings on presentation included HbA1c 5.1%, fasting glucose 95 mg/dL, cholesterol 188 mg/dL (desirable < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides 110 mg/dL (normal < 150 mg/dL), High-Density Lipoprotein 31 mg/dL (40–60 mg/dL), Low-Density Lipoprotein 102 (<100 mg/dL), Cholesterol 135 mg/dL (50–160 mg/dL), Very Low-Density Lipoprotein 22 mg/dL (0–38 mg/dL), risk ratio 6.1(low 3.0, average 5.0, high 13.0). Coagulation screen: partial thromboplastin time 30.1 (control 30.1 s), prothrombin time 11.1 (control 11.6), International Normalized Ratio 0.95. Cardiac triage: creatine kinase-MB 10.00 (0.00–16.00 U/L), troponin T < 50 ng/L (acute myocardial infarction NOT LIKELY). Myoglobin 32.0 (16–76 ng/ml). Autoimmune screen: cardiolipin Ig (immunoglobulin) A 4.78 (negative < 15APL, cardiolipin IgG 2.31 (< 10 GPL), cardiolipin IgM 1.32 (negative < 15 MPL), ANA IgG 0.05 (<0.9 no detectable ANA IgG by ELISA). Hematology: platelets 256 (150–410 ×103/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), hemoglobin 15.3 (13–17 g/dL), hematocrit 45 (40–50%), low mean corpuscular volume 79 (83–101 fl). Factor V Leiden 2.57 (ratio 2.18–3.38), fibrinogen 4.09 (3.08–6.13 g/L), lupus anticoagulant screen 1.52 (ratio positive > 1.2. C-reactive protein < 5.0 (<10 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 10 (male, 17–50 years ≤ 10 mm/h), protein C 123 (70.0–140.0% activity), elevated protein S 155 (63.0–135.0% activity), antithrombin III 96 (83–128% activity). Biochemistry: creatinine 0.81 (0.66–1.25 mg/dL), serum sodium 145 (135–148 mmol/L), serum potassium (3.8–5.2 mmol/L), mildly elevated serum chloride 110 (95–106 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen 15 (9.0–20.0 mg/dL). D-dimer 0.26 (<0.5 ug/ml), liver profile: elevated globulin 3.7 (2.3–3.5 g/dL). Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography was negative for valvular pathology or thrombus, no pericardial effusion with normal left ventricular wall motion (ejection fraction Simpson: 60%). Also, on presentation at the emergency department, a contrast computerized tomography (CT) of the head and neck showed a right vertebral artery arising from the right subclavian artery, but is small in caliber and does not fully opacify and dissection flap within the right vertebral artery. The left vertebral and common and internal carotid arteries are normal in caliber. A PPTA is present on the right side without associated cerebral aneurysm or vascular malformations noted. The aortic arch is normal in outline. A cerebral axial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed also at the time of presentation to the emergency department demonstrated an area of hyperintensity in the right parietal lobe adjacent to the Sylvian fissure (right middle cerebral artery territory) consistent with clinical findings, a right PPTA and diffuse narrowing of visualized part of the right vertebral artery, possibly hypoplastic . A 3D time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF MRA) on 1.5 Tesla demonstrated crescent sign in left vertebral artery indicating dissection , and PPTA between right ICA and distal basilar artery with normal diameter of both ICAs . The patient was anti-coagulated with intravenous heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, which resulted in rapid but incomplete resolution of symptoms. This initial anticoagulation was coupled with oral antiplatelet therapy, using aspirin and clopidogrel for the purpose of long-term administration. On follow-up, a repeat contrast MRI 10 days later demonstrated a hypoplastic right vertebral artery. In addition, a color duplex ultrasonogram of vertebral arteries demonstrated a flow-dependent flap seen on cardiac cycling along the intra-foraminal left vertebral artery. Clinically, at this 1-week post-presentation, he was with full recovery of motor and sensory function on the left side with a subjective assessment of mildly slurred speech. Subsequent follow-up detailed occasional mild neck pains of no subjective concerns regarding occupational hazards. Efforts have been made to review the progress of this patient, but he has been unable to present to the outpatient clinic for even further follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Axial DWI MRI showing hyperintensity in right parietal lobe adjacent to sylvian fissure.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) axial 3D-TOF MRI showing ‘crescent sign’ or dissection of left vertebral artery.

However, the causes are not always well-defined. In contrast to stroke in the elderly, causes are different and rare including illicit drug use, patent foramen ovale, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and cervical artery dissection. Cervical artery dissections are the most common cause of stroke in the young with vertebral artery dissections accounting for half as many as ICA dissections. Vertebral artery dissections are usually due to extrinsic factors such as trauma, whiplash accidents in motor vehicular accidents, direct hit, medical procedures and strangulation. Numerous reports have described rare etiologies including minor injuries from coughing, vomiting, violent sneezing, sports, roller coaster rides or chiropractic manipulation. Spontaneous dissections are also reported in those with underlying arteriopathy, such as connective tissue diseases or fibromuscular dysplasia. Due its low incidence rate, however, this may very well be also attributed to presumed minor injuries.\n\n【12】Vertebral artery dissections typically present with occipital headache, neck pain or vertigo, with some experiencing ischemic manifestations such as posterior circulation syndromes including lateral medullary syndrome—dysphagia, dizziness, vertigo, Horner’s syndrome, nystagmus. However, due to the presentation of anterior circulation infarct in this patient, cervical artery dissection as an etiology seems highly unlikely. However, in this patient, there was no clear evidence to support a hematological, inflammatory, traumatic, nor metabolic cause via the anterior circulation. After ruling out other causes of stroke in the young, imaging also revealed a PPTA that anastomoses the distal basilic artery to the right ICA. This anastomosis provides a potential conduit for emboli from the vertebral artery dissection resulting in an anterior circulation stroke instead of a typical posterior circulation stroke.\n\n【13】PPTA is the most common and largest of the primitive carotid-basilar anastomoses that persist into adulthood with a prevalence of 0.1% and 0.68% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Other persistent primitive anastomoses include the primitive otic (acoustic) artery, the primitive hypoglossal artery and the primitive proatlantal artery. There have been infrequent reports cases of these anastomoses implicated in multi-territorial infarcts attributed to their role as conduits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】To the best of our experience, this is the first report of vertebral artery dissection and anterior circulation stroke secondary to embolism through PPTA.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All individuals in this report have made exceptional contributions.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgment for funding has been identified.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required in this instance.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Received and available if requested.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Dale A.

Non-cutaneous abnormalities (dental, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurological, ophthalmic, pulmonary and skeletal) have also been reported. Bone marrow failure (BMF) is the main cause of early mortality, with an additional predisposition to malignancy. DC results from an anomalous progressive shortening of telomeres resulting in DNA replication problems inducing replicative senescence. Men are more affected than women are and X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disease are recognized. There are no targeted therapies for DC. Patients treated with androgens had a hematological response. We herein describe case of a 32-year-old man, presented with several characteristic systemic features of this condition, including the classic triad of lesions, dysplastic bone marrow, epiphora and liver cirrhosis with grade I esophageal varices.

The syndrome shows a typical triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and reticular hyperpigmentation. It is frequently complicated by malignancy and bone marrow failure. Males are more affected than females since the inheritance is classically x-linked recessive and most cases occur between the ages of 5 and 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We report a case of 32-year-old patient with DC in our department of clinical hematology at Tishreen University Hospital, in an attempt to increase awareness about this rare disease.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 32-year-old male, without significant past medical history, he was admitted in the department of clinical hematology for a diagnostic workup for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. At admission, patient appeared pale but vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed nail dystrophy , leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue , Hyperkeratotic and pigmented patches were present on the back, neck, trunk and palms . Patient did not have a history of tobacco usage. The onset of the cutaneous lesions was at 7 years of age with slow and progressive accentuation. Patient mentioned presence of similar case in his family (brother, uncle {maternal side}). Mental retardation was not observed. Admission labs included WBC: 2.200 cells/ul, Absolute neutrophil count: 1.500 cells/ul, hemoglobin 8 g/dl, platelet: 65 000/ul, creatinine: 1 mg/dl, ALT: 13 U/L, international normalization ratio (INR):1.9. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done and showed normocellularity with trilineage dysplastic changes, dysplastic changes in RBC lineage were characteristic . According to these findings, the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was confirmed. Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen revealed, coarsened hepatic echotexture, moderate splenomegaly 15.5 cm and an important dilation of the splenic veins at the splenic hilum and the portal veins. Therefore, portal hypertension was suspected due to hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis. The patient was referred for gastrointestinal consultation then prepared for high-digestive endoscopy, which revealed, grade I esophageal varices. Unfortunately, percutaneous liver biopsy was contraindicated due to tendency to bleed because of thrombocytopenia and prolonged INR. Therefore, prophylactic propranolol was initiated. Viral marker for hepatitis B or C that could cause pancytopenia showed no specific viral infection. The patient did not present with respiratory complaint, chest X-ray indicated hilar enlargement after which CT of the chest showed no abnormality. Epiphora was mentioned and punctual atresia was suspected but the patient refused to be referred for ophthalmologic consultation. The patient in this study presented all the components of the triad, in addition to bone marrow dysplasia, hepatic cirrhosis and ophthalmologic manifestation. We started the treatment with danazol a synthetic androgen derivative also known as 17α-ethinyl testosterone. Three-week later a good hematologic response was observed, WBC: 5500 cells/ul, Absolute neutrophil count: 3000 cells/ul, Hgb: 9 g/dl and Plt: 95 000/ul. The patient currently undergoing outpatient treatment at the hematology and gastroenterology outpatient clinics.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Nail dystrophy ( **a** , **b** ); Leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue ( **c** ); Abnormal skin pigmentation of back area ( **d** ).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Dysplastic features of erythroid linage.</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】DC is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence of one case in one million, with multiple and variable clinical manifestations, the classic and initial form are usually characterized by the mucocutaneous triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy and leukoplakia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with DC have been shown to have disease diversity in terms of age at onset, symptoms and severity. Even if the patients have the same gene mutation, the manifestations of the disease are variable, which is why sometimes it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Nail changes are characterized by thin, dystrophic nails that may be markedly shortened and fragile with a subungual thickening, the dystrophy usually appears in the first decade of life and begins as longitudinal ridging and splitting. With the progression of the disease, it eventually leads to pterygium formation with the distal expansion of the hyponychium and obliteration of the distal groove 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Skin findings can be variable, ranging from tan-to-gray macular or patchy areas of hyper or hypopigmentation with a reticulated or mottled pattern. Atrophy and telangiectasia can also be present (poikiloderma), DC is also frequently associated with oral findings, which include oral leukoplakia, increased dental caries, hypodontia, thin enamel structure, aggressive periodontitis, intraoral brown pigmentation, tooth loss, taurodontism and blunted roots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The patient described in this paper showed reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin with onset in the seventh year of life, nail dystrophy on the toes and leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue—that is, the three components of the classic triad. The BM findings in DC are variable and range from normal to different severity of aplasia depending on the stage of the disease. Sometimes it is indistinguishable from aplastic anemia due to other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The BM abnormalities can progress in different forms with the appearance of myelo-dysplasia in one or more lineages or leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our 32-year-old patient, the initial labs revealed pancytopenia. Then, MDS was confirmed according to bone marrow aspiration and biopsy findings. Hepatic complications have been described, too. Some studies reported that loss-of-function telomerase gene variants are risk factors for sporadic cirrhosis. However, there is not a definitive conclusion that can explain the appearance of hepatic complications in DC. The possible hepatic complications can show diverse histological liver features such as necrosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation and hyperplasia, although hepatic lesions are not a frequent complication in DC (~7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, US of the abdomen suggested portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Then, high-digestive endoscopy confirmed the presence of grade I esophageal varices. Therefore, prophylactic propranolol was started. Pulmonary fibrosis characterized by loss of lung epithelium, prominent fibrosis and impaired gas exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In addition, abnormalities of pulmonary vasculature are seen in ~80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had no pulmonary manifestation. The clinical diagnosis of DC is based on the presence of the four major features of the disease, which include the mucocutaneous triad and bone marrow failure, as well as the presence of multisystem features of the disease: epiphora, developmental delay or mental retardation, pulmonary disease, periodontal disease, esophageal stricture, premature hair graying or loss, hyperhidrosis or development of malignant lesions. To make a correct clinical diagnosis of DC requires at least two of four major features and at least two multisystem features, and sometimes it is difficult because of the disease heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient had the mucocutaneous triad, in additional to MDS, hepatic involvement and ophthalmic manifestation. There is no effective and curative treatment for DC. It is now apparent that androgens can elicit a hematologic response in a substantial proportion of patients with specific inherited BMF syndromes, namely Fanconi anemia and DC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient began taking danazol and 3 weeks later a good hematologic response was detected. We experienced a patient who was diagnosed as DC with MDS. DC is being now studied ever more intensively and this case report can be beneficial not only to the health care professional but to those suffering from this rare disease.\n\n【11】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【12】No funding was received.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient to participate in the study.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent to publish this information was obtained from patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

He was the first child in the family, born at term weighing 4 kg, following a normal pregnancy. There were no concerns in the neonatal period. At 10 months old, he suffered from fever measured at (39.5–40)°C at a rate of 2 to 3 times daily, partly controlled with antipyretic, associated with difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the pediatric department for 72 days. During admission, he had extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and needed oxygen. He was diagnosed with staphylococcal pneumonia and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. At 14 months old, he was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks with a lung infection requiring an invasive ventilator for 1 week. There was not any other medical, surgical or family history. He was passive exposure to tobacco smoke. The child underwent all the compulsory immunizations recommended for his age. On physical examination, his body weight was 14 kg (90.32%), length was 85 cm (58.706%), temperature 39°C, oxygen Saturation 95%, arterial blood pressure was 90/55 mm Hg, he was vitally stable and generally well. The patient underwent multiple investigations that showed hypochromic microcytic anemia \\[Hb 10 g/dl, MCV 59 fl\\] with an inflammatory response \\[C- reactive protein (CRP) 52 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84 mm at the end of 1st hour\\]. Other investigations including hepatic and renal function, blood glucose, and blood gas urinary investigations were normal. Chest X-Ray showed cloudy bilateral infiltrations . Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue . Echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), abdominal ultrasound, and direct investigation of Bacillus Koch in sputum on three-morning samples were performed that were normal. Pulmonary pressure was normal. Cystic fibrosis mutations, Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM) and alpha 1 Antitrypsin were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest-X-Ray demonstrating bilateral hazy infiltrates.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue.</u>\n\n【8】During the hospitalization, subcutaneous emphysema appeared in the neck  with nearly confluent erythematous macules and papules like seborrhea dermatitis appeared throughout the scalp and expanded to the back and abdomen . Histologic examination of a punch biopsy obtained which showed focal surface erosion with diffuse and nodular dermal infiltration by atypical relatively large cells, histiocytic like, with moderate eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm and slightly irregular or grooved nuclei. Some areas of the tumor show significant mitotic activity. Most of the tumor cells are found to be positive for S100 protein, and numerous ones of tumor cells are positive for CD68 that would confirm the diagnosis for LCH.

At this stage, the disease was in a regressive state and the patient proceeded to the second-line continuation chemotherapy consisting of three drugs (oral prednisone pulses, every three  weeks vinblastine and etoposide \\[Vp16\\]). He completed the 52 weeks of the continuation phase, and recent imaging confirmed that he still has the non-active disease.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】LCH is an unknown etiology, with several hypotheses that investigate whether it has a neoplastic or inflammatory origin, immunological, genetic or infectious (mainly viral) as triggering factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Historically, the first case of LSD was described by Letterer in 1924 and then defined the clinic pathological syndrome by Siwe in 1933 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. LSD usually appears within the first two years of life as cutaneous lesions in the scalp, face, thorax and perineum that are similar to seborrheic dermatitis. Many systemic symptoms may include ear drainage, anemia, fever, lymphadenopathy, osteolytic lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Pulmonary LCH (PLCH) includes cough, tachypnea, cyanosis, clubbing, hemoptysis or it may be asymptomatic. Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema are lower incidences in infancy compared with adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】In our case report, the pulmonary symptoms (recurrent pulmonary infections, subcutaneous emphysema) were the predominant symptoms, then the cutaneous lesions appeared and this considers rare in the literature. In the early stage of PLCH, chest X-ray reveals diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltration, symmetric linear and nodular opacities that develop in the later stage to cystic, bullous formation and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although the condition is not chronic in our patient, damage to the pulmonary tissue was significant.

Langerhans cells are immunohistochemically positive with antibodies to S-100 protein and CD1a 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Treatment of LSD depends on the number of organs affected. The treatment ranges from minimal therapy to intensive chemotherapy (Vinblastine and etoposide) associated with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In summary, this was a rare case report of LSD with unusual clinical presentation. The diagnosis was based on histological examination and immunophenotyping of the biopsied tissue.

He met the modified Duke’s criteria for definite infective endocarditis and was immediately started on an intravenous antibiotic. Over Days 1–9, he developed renal failure. On Day 10, he was transferred to a tertiary hospital for mitral valve replacement. However, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on arrival at the tertiary hospital, which delayed his surgery. He underwent bi-weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 with a plan to operate as soon as he tested negative, or as soon as his incubation period for COVID-19 pneumonia had elapsed. Unfortunately, he died on Day 31 from acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. We describe the challenges in deciding on the optimal timing for valve replacement. We conclude by suggesting that earlier valve replacement may result in better outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) is 3.6 per 100 000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Though IE originates as a valvular dysfunction, it is essentially a multisystemic disease for three reasons. Firstly, valvular dysfunction can cause cardiac failure which, in turn, precipitates renal failure causing circulatory compromise. Secondly, valvular dysfunction can cause embolic complications and their associated problems. Finally, patients are also at risk of mortality from the severe sepsis that occurs in IE, which can cause multi-organ failure in itself. Therefore, it is unsurprising that such patients have a high mortality, which is made even worse in the context of a superimposed COVID-19 pneumonia as described in this report.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In November 2020, a 74-year-old man with no co-morbidities presented to the emergency department of his local hospital with a 3-day history of diarrhoea and vomiting. On examination, he was agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12/15 (E4, V3 and M5). He had a pansystolic murmur that was heard loudest at the apex, which radiated to the left axilla. He had a number of physical signs suggestive of IE, which are shown in Figs 1 and 2 . He also had evidence of impaired oral hygiene, which is shown in Fig. 3 . His inflammatory markers were elevated. His peripheral blood cultures were taken, and he was started on intravenous ceftriaxone immediately afterwards. His blood culture grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ . A routine SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab taken on admission was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation ( Video File 1 ) as well as vegetations on both mitral and aortic valves ( Video File 2 ). Consequently, the patient satisfied two major criteria (new valvular regurgitation and the presence of vegetations) as well as three minor criteria (multiple Osler nodes, a Janeway lesion and a single positive blood culture) of the modified Duke’s criteria for IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hence, definite IE was confirmed.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Image **A** shows the presence of a Janeway lesion and a nail bed haemorrhage on the third digit of the left hand; image **B** also shows the presence of an Osler node on the first digit of the left hand.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Osler node on the fifth digit of the right hand.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Amalgam restoration in the upper first molar on the right side with absent upper first premolar and molar on the left side.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4 shows the trend in his white cell count and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over Days 1–9.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous venovenous haemofiltration. However, a routine admission nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on Day 11 was positive, thus delaying his surgery. We believe this infection may have occurred either during transit or during the final few days of the patient’s admission at his local hospital. On admission to the tertiary hospital, he underwent serial nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 at twice weekly intervals. A plan was made to operate as soon as he tested negative, or as soon as we could be satisfied that his COVID-19 pneumonia incubation period had elapsed.\n\n【12】However, on Day 24, he developed nausea and vomiting. Computerised Tomography (CT) imaging of his chest showed peripheral ground glass change with bilateral pleural effusions in keeping with COVID-19 pneumonia . He was started on supplementary oxygen, oral dexamethasone and intravenous remdesivir. This was in accordance with local guidelines for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time. He initially maintained an oxygen saturation >92% without the need for invasive ventilation. However, he died on Day 31 from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Images **A** and **B** are axial CT views showing patchy consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions; image **C** is a coronal CT view showing patchy consolidation; these features are in keeping with acute COVID-19 pneumonia.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】We identified four other case reports of IE complicated by COVID-19 pneumonia from Italy, Indonesia, Brazil and Morocco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. A common theme identified from these cases was a delay in surgical valve replacement. A fatal outcome was observed in two cases, including the index patient and the patient from Brazil. An international study of 1128 patients found that 49.6% of patients who underwent an emergency operation after SARS-CoV-2 infection developed post-operative pulmonary complications such as ARDS within 30 days of their operation. In this group, the 30-day mortality rate was 39.6%. The authors also reported that male sex and age of greater than 70 years were poor prognosticators, both of which were present in the index patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Moreover, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to independently increase the risk of ARDS. It postulated that the mixing of blood with non-endothelial surfaces during cardiopulmonary bypass increases the production of tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 10, both of which are cytokines implicated in the development of ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Despite these compelling reasons to delay the surgery, our final decision to delay was weighed carefully against the argument that delaying the surgery would have exposed him to an increased duration of IE-related disease. Nonetheless, on balance, we still felt that our decision to delay was appropriate. On reflection, this case demonstrates how challenging it can be to decide on the optimal timing of surgery in such patients.\n\n【16】Another common theme between our case and others was the prevalence of _Staphylococcus aureus_ . The index patient as well as the patients from Brazil and Italy had _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteraemia with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. _Staphylococcus aureus_ has been reported to be present in the saliva of 21% of patients with oral disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and the oral cavity was the most likely reservoir for infection in this patient. Its combination with a SARS-CoV-2 co-infection confers significant morbidity and mortality. A case series of 42 patients found that mortalities at 14 and 30 days in patients who had _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteraemia with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 co-infection were 54.8 and 66.7%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】This case sheds light on whether it is justified to offer surgical valve replacement to IE patients who are SARS-CoV-2-positive and within the incubation period for COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite the compelling reasons to delay the surgery, we conclude by suggesting that earlier surgical valve replacement, before the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, could result in better outcomes in carefully selected patients.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Shaun Robinson (consultant clinical scientist) for providing and formatting the echocardiography video files.

From 2014 to 2020 we diagnosed four patients with spontaneous reattachment of RRD. We conducted a review of the relevant medical records, focusing on the initial symptoms at presentation, the initial diagnoses, with a further observation of the patients next 3 years. The patients were re-examined 3 years later after cases of spontaneous reattachment of RRD. Three years after a case of spontaneous reattachment of RRD during reexamination in four patients (four eyes), redetachment was not detected. The mentioned clinical cases indicate the possibility of finding new approaches to RRD management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a progressive state requiring surgical intervention aimed to block retinal tears (RT) and remove vitreoretinal traction. It is known that surgery is the sole management of RRD and must be performed immediately. Scleral buckling and vitrectomy are targeted to block RT and reduce vitreoretinal traction with retinal reattachment as a potential outcome. As far as literature review shows, undiagnosed RRD or delay in surgery may result with spontaneous reattachment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (SRRRD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case No. 1\n\n【6】A 45-year-old female noted a sudden loss of vision on the right eye (OD) a month ago. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was incorrect light projection OD and 20/200 in the left eye (OS); low visual acuity OS caused by myopic maculopathy. Dilated fundus examination (DFE) OD revealed posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and RRD in three quadrants with retinal folds and RT at 12:00 and 1:00 o’clock at the periphery. Vitreoretinal surgery was offered to the patient. One month later, SRRRD was diagnosed  and retinal laser coagulation (RLC) was performed around RT. One week later, BCVA OD was correct light projection; another week later, it became 20/4000. A year later, cataract surgery was performed and BCVA OD reached 20/800.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Right eye fundus of Case 1 after SRRRD.

DFE OS revealed PVD with RRD in two upper quadrants involving the macula with RT at 12:30, 6:00 and 9:00 o’clock. Vitreoretinal surgery was offered to the patient. A month later, SRRRD was diagnosed  and RLC over RT was performed.

However, they pointed out that detached retina with vitreous traction and fixed retinal folds showed an insignificant tendency toward spontaneous reattachment.\n\n【28】De Jong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> concluded that limiting head and eye movements is enough to prevent RRD progression, but it should not be counted as an only contributing factor to SRRRD; the authors supposed that the gravitational force effect on the retina and subretinal fluid is small because of the no density difference between them.\n\n【29】Some studies have suggested that the basis for the development of SRRRD presumably involves the occurrence of a complete PVD that in most cases relieves vitreoretinal traction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Inflammatory response to RT in addition to RRD triggers microglial and Müller cells migration and their massive proliferation at the vitreoretinal interface to establish a glial scar that closes RT and, in our opinion, facilitates developing SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> suggested that, after a partial PVD that relieves vitreoretinal traction, vitreous fibers running parallel to the retinal plane may close RT and interrupt the fluid inflow; in another words, the occurrence of PVD with a consequent RT plugging; subsequently, RPE removes residual subretinal fluid by active transport and/or by Starling force (the balance between capillary pressure, interstitial pressure, and osmotic pressure) that is conducive to SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In our study patients were not limited in head and eye movement or neither in a bed position, they had various types of RT, one patient had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, one patient had no PVD; the clinical variability of the SRRRD may contradicts studies above.\n\n【31】There were several limitations in our study. First, the limited number of the cases and retrospective nature of this study. Second, all patients were not comprehensively examined by imaging tools with focus imaging of RT and detachment before SRRRD to determine the pathogenesis of SRRRD. We recognize and do not undermine the importance of vitreoretinal surgery in RRD; we strongly recommended surgery to all our patients.\n\n【32】To summarize, SRRRD is a rare event in ophthalmologist’s practice, accumulating case reports may provide significant information in understanding the current phenomenon. In certain cases, persistent reattachment of the retina after RRD without any intervention is possible. The mentioned clinical cases indicate the possibility of finding new approaches to RRD management.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.

Trisomy 13 mosaicism is a subtype that may result in a milder form of the disease, potentially leading to a longer life expectancy in these patients, allowing them to reach puberty. In this report, we discuss the case of a young boy who was evaluated for delayed puberty and karyotyping revealed mosaicism for trisomy 13. A detailed history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies and imaging were performed that showed a picture of suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an abnormal male karyotype with mosaicism for trisomy 13. To date, there is no clear explanation to the association between trisomy 13 and gonadal axis, specifically with normal imaging of pituitary. We postulate that delayed puberty could be a clinical feature of mosaic trisomy 13.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13) was first described in 1960 by Dr Patau _et al_ . It is the third most frequent chromosomal trisomy with an incidence of about 1/8000–12 000 births. Compared with the general neonatal mortality rate, the estimated mortality rate from trisomy 13 is about 50 times higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In total, 28% of newborns with Patau syndrome die within the first week of life, 44% in the first month and 86% by 1 year of age. Survival beyond the first year of life is unusual and exceptional beyond the first decade, with only a small number of cases experiencing pubertal age. Mortality in Patau is attributed to cardiopulmonary failure, congenital heart defects and pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In 5% of cases, not all cells are trisomic; some are euploid; this is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. This entity is not well described but may lead to a milder form of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Delayed puberty is yet to be reported in these patients, likely owing to the short life expectancy.\n\n【5】In this report, we discuss a case of mosaic trisomy 13 who presented with delayed puberty. We tried to establish that there could be a possible association between mosaic trisomy 13 and constitutional delay in puberty (CDP).\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A young, pleasant boy was first seen at the age of 14 years as his parents were concerned about his pubertal development and size of genitalia. He is a product of non-consanguineous parents and had a normal natal and postnatal history. He did not suffer from any chronic medical illness and was not on any long-term medications. Growth developmental milestones were normally attained and had a good scholastic performance. There is no family history of delayed puberty or any endocrine problems.\n\n【8】On examination: height 166 cm (slightly below 50th percentile), weight 61.1 kg (75th percentile) . He had normal facial features and a normal sense of smell. Sexual maturity scores revealed microgenitalia: stretched penile length (SPL) 4 cm and bilaterally small testes 5 ml, axillary and pubic hair tanner stage 2, no gynecomastia. Systemic examination was unremarkable, apart from kyphosis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Growth chart: height and weight.</u>\n\n【10】At a chronological age of 14, bone age corresponded to 12 years, thereby indicating a delayed bone age . General laboratory investigations were all normal. Baseline hormonal assay collected in the morning time including luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.5 mIU/ml (1.7–8.6), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) 1.2 mIU/l (1.5–12.4), testosterone level 0.8 nmol/l (0.98–38.5) and free androgen index 2.5 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–150)</u>, all of which were below normal range. The rest of pituitary evaluation, including IGF-1, Prolactin, Cortisol AM, TSH were all normal. These findings were suggestive of either CDP or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|X-ray hand: bone age.</u>\n\n【12】In patients suspected with HH chromosomal analysis to exclude congenital causes of delayed puberty is recommended. Karyotyping revealed Mos 47, XY, +13, with two cell lines: 87% of the cells having normal karyotype and the remainder with 47 chromosomes including an additional chromosome 13. Further cytogenic analysis using fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization confirmed the above observation revealing 23% cells with Trisomy 13 (161/700 cells) . Given the karyotype result, an echocardiography was done, which ruled out any cardiac abnormality.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Karyotype: mosaic trisomy 13.</u>\n\n【14】GnRH testing is generally used to differentiate between CDP and HH. The LH response to GnRH in boys with CDP usually exceeds that of HH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. In one report LH level exceeding 5.3 U/l is associated with progression in testicular volume and penile size. Following a GnRH stimulation test: LH showed an increase of up to 16 mIU/ml, FSH 9.3 mIU/L and testosterone 2.4 nmol/l. These findings are in favor of CDP. Further workup included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Sella that showed a normal-sized pituitary gland, no supra or para-sellar masses .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|GnRH stimulation test\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n【18】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|GnRH stimulation test\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n【22】Open in new tab\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Normal MRI brain.</u>\n\n【24】The patient was diagnosed with CDP, and given the size of the genitalia, he was started on a small permissive dose of testosterone (50 mg of testosterone decanoate) monthly for 3 months to assist with sexual maturity. He was advised to adopt a healthier lifestyle by incorporating more physical activity and followed up for 4 years. No further intervention was needed as he continued to show significant improvement in sexual maturity as well as hormonal profiles. He showed normal attainment of height, weight, muscle bulk and reached puberty by the age of 17. Latest physical examination findings showed SPL of 14 cm, testicular volume of 18–20 ml and tanner stage 4 for axillary and pubic hair.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】Trisomy 13 is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing multiple malformations including central nervous system, cardiac and urogenital anomalies. Characteristic features of Trisomy 13 include microphthalmia or anophthalmia, cleft lip and palate, and polydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The median survival time for patients with Trisomy 13 is 7–10 days, approximately 86–91% of live-born patients with this syndrome do not survive beyond the first year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, survival beyond the first year of life has been associated with mosaicism, which accounts 5% of these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The phenotype and outcome of mosaic trisomy 13 is at present poorly understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The most common cause of delayed puberty is attributed to constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a self-limiting condition in which puberty starts later than usual but shows normal progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient presented at the age of 14 with microgenitalia, slightly delayed bone age and initially low testosterone level but eventually showed a gradual progression in growth. He remained within the 50th percentile for his weight and height and attained normal sexual maturation by the age of 17. He had no other congenital anomalies that are commonly associated with Patau and had a normal intellectual function.\n\n【28】We were able to trace one case report of a 20-year-old male with Patau syndrome and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). This patient presented with lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics and normal height, clinical features and biochemical parameters associated with IHH. Clinical findings commonly associated with trisomy 13 were absent in this patient. MRI brain showed a normal olfactory bulb and tract but shallow olfactory sulcus and Karyotyping revealed two cell lines: one showing deletion of chromosome 13 at band 13p10.8 and another showing trisomy 13 with homologous Robertsonian translocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】To the best of our knowledge, there has been a single case report to link trisomy 13 to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; however, there were no previous case reports that linked mosaic trisomy 13 to CDP. In summary, there could be a possible association between mosaic trisomy 13 and CDP which may present in the form of hypogonadism, and in the presence of supporting clinical evidence, trisomy 13 should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of delayed puberty.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no financial relationships relevant to this article to disclose.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from patients’ parent.

The protozoa is obliged intracellularly and causes a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes: VL (‘kala azar’), cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (espundia). Kala azar is the most aggressive form and if untreated causes high mortality. Here, we describe a case of VL that presented to us with high-grade fever and found to have Roth spots that were resolved after 15 days of therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus _Leishmania_ . Most cases tend to occur between April and September. The female sandfly specifically feeds at dusk, and tends to remain near its breeding area. Transmission of VL has also been seen by sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, contaminated needles and rarely congenitally. Nearly 50% of VL cases occur in children.\n\n【4】In India, the peak age is between 5 and 9 years and mostly seen in males. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) results in systemic infection of the reticuloendothelial organs and bone marrow. The classical symptoms of VL are high-grade fever, pallor, refusal to feed, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperpigmentation, epistaxis and gingival bleeding. Laboratory tests with classic kala azar usually reveal thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, elevated hepatic transaminase levels and hypoalbuminaemia. The parasite may be detected through direct evidence in the peripheral blood, bone marrow or splenic aspirates.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We report a case of a 7-year-old male child, a resident of Delhi who migrated to Bihar (a state of India) 6 months back, had been resident in Bihar for 1 month only and developed symptoms after 6 months returning to Delhi, presented to us with poor oral intake and high-grade fever for 15 consecutive days. On admission he had pallor and spleno-hepatomegaly.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests gave the following results: haemoglobin 8.5 mg/dl, total leucocyte counts 2990/µl, platelet counts 54 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µl, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 83 U/l, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 85 U/l, serum albumin 3.7 g/dl and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 53 mm/h. Blood culture, tests for malaria and enteric fever were negative. Viral markers and HIV ELISA were also negative. Echocardiography was normal. Fundus by slit-lamp examination revealed _Roth spots_ . The rk39 (recombinant k 39) was negative but in the bone marrow aspiration, intracellular _Leishmani donovani_ bodies were observed.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Slit-lamp examination showing Roth spots.</u>\n\n【9】Therapy with conventional amphotericin B with IV infusion over 4 h was started and child became afebrile after 3 days of therapy. The child was given a total of 15 mg/kg of amphotericin B. No side effect of amphotericin was observed. After completion of therapy, Roth spots were disappeared. 3 months later, he came for follow-up and was found well.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Roth's spots are retinal haemorrhages with white or pale centres composed of coagulated fibrin. They are typically observed via fundoscopy (using an ophthalmoscope) or slit-lamp examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. They are usually caused by immune-complex mediated vasculitis often seen in bacterial endocarditis. Roth's spots may be observed in leukaemia, diabetes, subacute bacterial endocarditis, anaemia, anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, prolonged intubation, preeclampsia, HIV retinopathy, complicated labour and traumatic delivery in mothers and neonates, shaken baby syndrome, intracranial haemorrhage from AV malformation or aneurysm and acute reduction of intraocular pressure following trebeculectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Possible aetiology of Roth spots in our patient could be due to thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Thrombocytopenia can cause haemorrhages in the retina on mucous surfaces and in the skin. Anaemia may cause further anoxic insult to retinal capillaries in patients with kala azar.\n\n【13】Leishmaniasis is endemic in many countries in tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa, Asia, Central and South Americas and Mediterranean regions. Five countries, namely Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil account for 90% of the world incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】VL is a potentially fatal parasitic disease, directly associated with poverty, overcrowding and poor-ventilation. The burden of this disease is also influenced by social factors such as under-nutrition, sanitation, presence of other infectious diseases such as HIV, which delays diagnosis and management. This leads to increased morbidity and mortality due to this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Kala azar is endemic in 52 districts in India, Bihar 通用删除7(英):<u>(31)</u>, Jharkhand 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>, West Bengal 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> and Uttar Pradesh 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>. While both cutaneous and visceral disease occurs in India, Kala azar is by far the most important leishmaniasis in India.\n\n【16】The Aldehyde test remains reliable when testing for surveillance rather than diagnostic purposes. This is due to its relative lack of specificity but high sensitivity at even 3 months post-infection. The new and simple rk39 diagnostic test may be useful screening tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It has a sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100%. Definitive diagnosis is made by demonstration of amastigotes by microscopic examination of materials obtained by bone marrow aspiration or splenic puncture.\n\n【17】The currently used drugs for the treatment of VL are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> sodium stibogluconate, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> amphotericin B, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> miltefosine and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> paromomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Under NVBDCP (National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme) miltefosine as a first-line treatment and amphotericin B as a second-line treatment are used.\n\n【18】Our literature search was unable to find another recorded case of VL with Roth spots in children. We therefore conclude that Roth spots are a rare clinical finding in VL and could therefore be considered to be characteristic for kala azar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This is the first report to describe a case of HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA that was treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. In this early case, upfront surgery outcomes guided the selection of appropriate systemic therapy. A 31-year-old woman previously diagnosed with FA experienced tumor growth. Core needle biopsy and imaging studies confirmed a diagnosis of stage IIA HER2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with no evidence of lymph node metastasis (cT2N0M0). Breast-conserving surgery was performed. Pathological diagnosis revealed stage IA IDC with a predominant intraductal component (pT1aN0M0), arising from FA. In conclusion, we encountered an extremely rare case of HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA in which pathological infiltration was difficult to predict based on preoperative imaging.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fibroadenoma (FA) is one of the most common benign breast tumors with a peak age of onset between 15 and 35 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Breast cancer rarely arises from FA and is detected only in 0.02–0.125% of FA-related cases, usually in patients over 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, clinical, sonographic and mammographic findings are similar to those of FA alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, thereby complicating cancer detection.

However, almost all cases, in which subtypes have been reported are of luminal or triple-negative types, were negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Herein, we report a rare case of HER2-positive early breast cancer arising from FA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old woman presented without any medical or family history of cancer. Approximately, 1 year before her current presentation, a 13-mm-sized left breast mass was detected on breast screening , classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3. The patient was diagnosed with FA based on imaging alone. Follow-up imaging revealed mass enlargement and presence of new calcifications , which prompted core needle biopsy. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was diagnosed, and immunohistochemical staining revealed an HER2 score of 3+ (HER2-positive), without ER or PgR expression. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of axillary lymph nodes suggested no evidence of metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a maximum lesion diameter of 22 mm. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed absence of distant metastasis. Thus, stage IIA HER2-positive IDC (cT2N0M0) was diagnosed. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was considered, upfront breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed based on the patient’s preference. The patient refused genetic testing for hereditary cancers. The excised specimen surface contained a relatively well-circumscribed, grey-white and solid 19-mm tumor . Histologically, this lobulated lesion had predominantly intraductal solid growth patterns of large carcinoma cells with marked coagulation necroses and calcium depositions . Carcinoma cells were polygonal, showing high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and irregular nuclei with distinct nucleoli. Infiltrating elements of histological grade 3, up to 4 mm, were observed in the lesion , with scattered microinvasive foci . On immunohistochemical examination, neoplastic cells were negative for ER and PgR (total Allred scores: 0 and 0, respectively) . The HER2 score was estimated to be 3+ in invasive and intraductal neoplastic cells , and the Ki67 (MIB-1) labeling index was 58.7%. Myoepithelial cells, positive for p63 and CD10, were identified in intraductal components. Based on these pathological findings, an invasive carcinoma of no special type, HER2 immuno-subtype, with a predominant intraductal component, derived from an intracanalicular FA was diagnosed. Since sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed absence of metastasis, the final diagnosis was stage IA IDC (pT1aN0M0). Pathological findings guided selection of weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab as adjuvant systemic therapy. Additionally, the patient underwent radiotherapy of the whole left breast (42.56 Gy) and tumor-bed boost irradiation (10.64 Gy), considering her age. Approximately 6 months following surgery, no apparent recurrence was noted.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Comparison between images of the left breast tumor taken 1 year earlier ( **a** and **b** ) and before the current operation ( **c** and **d** ) (a, c, mammogram (cranio-caudal view); b, d, ultrasonography).

First, breast cancer arising from FA could involve HER2-positive type; thus, chemotherapy with targeted therapy should be considered. Second, upfront surgery may be a useful guide for selecting appropriate systemic therapy.\n\n【11】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe an HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy. We conducted literature searches with PubMed using the keywords ‘fibroadenoma’ and ‘carcinoma’ to collect articles in English published between February 2013 and June 2021; for literature published between January 1986 and January 2013, we referred to the review by Wu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA is extremely rare, with only one reported case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, a somewhat different case of coexistence of HER2-positive breast cancer, phyllodes tumor and FA has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, to date, no cases have mentioned a systemic treatment strategy.\n\n【12】Currently, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy is generally considered for HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. The number of patients receiving NAC has recently increased due to the potential for improving breast preservation rate and achieving pathological complete response with good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, chemotherapy de-escalation is another significant issue. Using non-anthracycline regimens has become a common option for low-risk patients because anthracycline-based regimens could cause cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemotherapy regimen is generally selected by considering the infiltration diameter of the tumor. However, since the histological type of this disease is mainly carcinoma _in situ_ or early invasive breast cancer, it is difficult to base this regimen selection on preoperative imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Wu _et al_ . reported a mean tumor diameter of breast cancer within FA of 2.46 cm. However, 33.3% of cases were pTis, and those with a known infiltration diameter were pT1a or pT1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our case, the actual infiltration diameter was only up to 4 mm (pT1a). However, the imaging-based tumor diameter was 22 mm (cT2). Therefore, upfront surgery could help in guiding the selection of a less intense non-anthracycline regimen. Furthermore, it may be a reasonable choice to avoid chemotherapy altogether.\n\n【14】It should be noted that even tumors with small infiltration diameter (pT1mi or pT1a) may involve lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. FNAC should be performed, if possible, since NAC may be a better approach when lymph node metastasis is detected. In our case, although mild lymphadenopathy was observed, FNAC did not reveal metastasis.\n\n【15】In conclusion, breast cancer arising from FA could present as an HER2-positive type; hence, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy should be considered. Upfront surgery may be useful in guiding selection of an appropriate adjuvant therapy, owing to difficulty in predicting infiltration diameter through preoperative imaging alone. It is unclear how breast cancers arise from FA and why these cases tend to more frequently involve HER2-negative subtype, and further research is required.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors’ COI are not related to this work.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Osaki reports personal fees from AstraZeneca K.K.; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.

Only relapse of the lymphoma from the same area with involvement of the soft tissue and local lymph nodes allowed to establish a correct diagnosis and start treatment. Also, in this case, we observed the development of the second cancer (melanoma), which has the same cytogenetic abnormality as ALCL (t\\[2;5\\]).\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary bone lymphoma (PBL) is a rare type of extranodal lymphoma, representing 3% of all malignant bone tumors and 1% of all malignant lymphomas. The etiology of PBL is unknown; viral agents and immunosuppression are implicated in some cases. Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities are involved in the pathophysiology of different types of lymphomas.\n\n【4】Most cases (70–80%) of PBL are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) type of PBL is extremely rare (1%), and only 22 cases were described by 2018 in the English-language literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The prognosis of ALCL that primarily involves bone is unfavorable compared with general PBL. Clinical symptoms in patients with PBL are unspecific; the differential diagnosis usually requires much time, leading to delays in treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This fact has profound implications for the disease prognosis. Our case demonstrates the difficulty in obtaining the correct diagnosis of a rare form of PBL, ALCL anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (ALK+ ALCL). In addition, we highlight a cytogenetic anomaly, t (2;5), as a common factor in the development of lymphoma and melanoma—the second neoplasm of the patient.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 35-year-old Caucasian man began to have spontaneous pain in the left hip in August 2017. He used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which relieved the pain. He was admitted to the hospital in September 2017 complaining of intense pain that worsened when he did weight-bearing activities. He also reported that pain became more intense over the last month and sometimes he had it at rest. The physical examination of the left hip and left hip joint was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations revealed a leucocyte count of 4.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl (the normal range: 4.5–11 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl), C-reactive protein concentration of 2.6 mg/dl (<0.9 mg/dl) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 18 mm/h (0–22 mm/h), and screening for infectious organisms, including microscopy, polymerase chain reaction and culture for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ was negative. A bone scan was performed. Because of the morphology on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), osteomyelitis of the left proximal femur was suspected . An open biopsy of the left femur was performed. Histology revealed normal tissue, no signs of osteomyelitis were found. The patient consulted with a hematologist/oncologist and surgeon. Based on the data, physical exam and MRI data, a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis of the left proximal femur with unknown etiology was made. Bone necrotomy was performed in January 2018. Samples of blood and bone fragments were taken from the damaged area for microbiological analysis. After 5 and 7 days, the samples analyzed showed no bacterial or fungal growth, and the patient received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The operative wound healed without any complications. The patient’s condition improved, with no pain or other complaints. Twelve months later (January 2019), the patient was presented to the main military hospital with gradually progressive pain and swelling of the left hip. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan imaging demonstrated tense metabolic activity in the proximal part of the left femur and soft tissue lump formation (164 × 114 × 200 mm in size and maximum standardized uptake value of 33.9). Local lymph nodes were involved: left internal iliac nodes (15 × 8 mm) and left inguinal nodes (15 × 9 mm). Next, a biopsy of the tumor tissue of the left hip was performed. Histological examination showed large, atypical cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric horseshoe nuclei. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD45, CD30 and ALK-1 but negative for CD20, CD3 and CDPAX5. Ki-67 showed a very high nuclear proliferative index with positive staining in 80–90% of the cells . Fluorescent in situ hybridization showed cytogenetic translocation—t(2;5). A final diagnosis of PBL—ALK-positive ALCL—was made. The patient started chemotherapy with the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone regimen for six cycles. A PET/CT scan was done at the end of chemotherapy to assess the response and consider further management. The PET scan showed no significant metabolically active disease in the primary bone lesion site or anywhere else in the body. The patient was given local radiotherapy with a dose of 30 Gy and was instructed to follow-up 12 months post-chemotherapy. There is no evidence of recurrence to date. However, 6 months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of a progressively enlarged dark pigmented lesion (10 mm) with bleeding and ulceration on his lower back. An excision biopsy of the lesion was performed. Pathology showed an ulcerated malignant melanoma . Thus, based on Warren and Gates criteria, we diagnosed double primary malignancies. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further treatment. The patient has been treated by nivolumab for 12 month. Currently he is in complete remission for both cancers.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Coronal image ( **A** ) and transversal image ( **B** ) showing irregular lytic lesions involving cortical destruction of the proximal right femur.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Immunohistochemistry of PBL.

The differential diagnosis generally considers chronic osteomyelitis, primary bone sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell lung carcinoma and small cell osteosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Diagnostic workup is complex and includes different types of radiology exams and histopathology tests. In most cases, radiographic imaging of the affected area is performed, but radiographic findings for patients with PBL make it challenging to distinguish it from other primary bone tumors. PET/CT and MRI are much more sensitive and effective methods in the case of PBL. Biopsy of the lesions is another critical investigation for diagnosis; however, according to the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, a bone biopsy is not informative for a significant fraction of patients with PBL. Also, PBL systemic symptoms are usually absent in most cases, and no clinical signs of malignant lymphoma exist. The combination of these facts explains why PBL is often misdiagnosed, and the start of treatment is delayed in patients with PBL, which can have severe effects on the prognosis of the disease.\n\n【13】In our case, the MRI and bone biopsy did not provide clues to the correct diagnosis.\n\n【14】Presumably, the surgical resection of the damaged bone led to a significant reduction of the tumor mass and, consequently, significantly delayed relapse of the disease (⁓12 months).\n\n【15】Relapse of the lymphoma at the area of primary femur damage allowed to perform soft tissue biopsy and established the ALCL diagnosis.\n\n【16】Retrospective analysis of the case re-evaluated osteomyelitis diagnosis, and the final diagnosis of PBL ALCL was made. A complete remission was achieved after chemotherapy. A follow-up investigation after 18 months confirmed metabolic remission of PBL; however, the primary melanoma was diagnosed.\n\n【17】Molecular characterization of melanoma revealed BRAF and ALK mutation.\n\n【18】Several translocations within the ALK locus (⁓22) are implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancer types. Among the 30–60% of systemic ALCL cases positive for ALK, 70–80% express the t (2;5) translocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Another cancer that is positive for ALK is melanoma. ALK translocation was first identified in patients with acral melanoma in Southern China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. A novel isoform of ALK <sup>ATI </sup> has been described in primary and metastatic melanomas. Both ALK <sup>ATI </sup> and ALK rearrangements led to an increase of the ALK expression, which is an oncogenic driver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Janostiak _et al_ . have shown that ALK is a driver of acquired BRAF kinase inhibitor (BRAFi) resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The ALK inhibitor ceritinib inhibited BRAFi-resistant melanoma in cell culture and mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Thus, additional investigations are required to reveal the clinical significance of ALK alterations in melanoma.\n\n【19】In the reported case, the ALK mutation is highly likely to have played an important role in the pathogenesis of both diseases: PBL ALCL ALK+ and melanoma. Further investigation of ALK mutations and individualized, targeted therapy will allow the treatment of patients with different neoplasms carrying common genome abnormalities.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Julian Markovich Rozenberg for his kind help with manuscript preparation.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was approved by the ethical committee of the Main Military Clinical Hospital named after N.N.

There are several ways of classifying congenital vascular anomalies. The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) has described uniform classification.

There was no history of trauma, coagulopathy, fever, irritability, poor feeding nor documentation of discolouration or patch during the first neonatal examination. The child was fed well, and the urine output and bowel frequency were normal.\n\n【9】This child was born as the second child to non-consanguine healthy parents with no family history of coagulopathies, after an uneventful antenatal period of 35 weeks by an emergency lower segment caesarean section due to foetal tachycardia. His birth weight was 2.62 kg. Then he was treated for suspected sepsis and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia at the special care baby unit and spent the first 2 days of life establishing feeding with nasogastric tube and formula top ups.\n\n【10】The clinical examination on admission showed bluish discoloration on the centre of the left buccal area measuring 3 cm horizontally and 2.5 cm in vertical plane . Firm mild tender underlying swelling without features of trauma, active bleeding or signs of inflammation together with bluish discoloration was identified in the buccal mucosa. The rest of the physical examination, system examination and anthropometric measurements were normal.\n\n【11】The laboratory investigations including full blood count, coagulation screen, inflammatory markers, renal profile, liver profile and bone profile were within normal limits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Due to the nature of the presentation the possibility of non-accidental injury (NAI) was considered and investigations including skeletal survey, computed tomography (CT) head, fundoscopy and strategy multidisciplinary meeting took place. The ultrasound examination of the lesion showed fluid and solid soft tissue suggestive of haematoma . CT scan of the head revealed that there is a 1–1.2-cm subcutaneous hyperdensity left buccal area with haematoma due to a possible pre-existing vascular malformation and no intracranial haemorrhages .

Most of the time vascular malformation is present as a birth mark.\n\n【18】Congenital vascular malformation arises because of structural malformations of vascular development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, which appears from in utero to childhood but most of the time lesions are diagnosed at birth. Vascular malformation causes surrounding soft tissue abnormality that leads to functional and aesthetic impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of the lesions and the treatments can be complicated, due to lack of signs and symptoms, lack of follow-up and limitation of specific diagnostic tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Majority of vascular malformation (~60%) in the children and neonate are confined to the head and neck region and it gives enormous psychological and physiological problems to both the child and the parents. All the congenital vascular anomalies are categorized into two main categories under vascular tumours and vascular malformation. Nomenclature of the vascular malformations depends on the predominant type of the vessel (lymphatic, arterial or venous) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Venolymphatic malformation comes under a combined category of vascular malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Vascular malformations are also categorized according to the haemodynamic characteristics under high–low and low flow. Venous, lymphatic and capillary malformations are categorized under low-flow malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Vascular malformation around the parotid gland is an extremely infrequent entity that needs a specific diagnostic and management approach. Up to now, a few cases have been reported and all of them were adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】When a nonmobile child, especially a neonate, present with bruises, NAI and coagulation disorders need be excluded. However, very rarely can neonate be presented with bruises due to the rupture of underlying vascular malformations. In this case, all the probable causes of bruises in neonate have been excluded, and the rupture of the parotid duct and venovascular malformation has been diagnosed by the MRI and repeated ultrasonography of the head and neck.\n\n【22】The plan of management for this child was watchful waiting for 3 months and then to be decided on further management depending on the nature of the residual lesion. According to Ana Paula Pinho Matos _et al._ 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, 15% (3/20) venolymphatic malformations has showed spontaneous resolution or stable and asymptomatic after 3–18-year follow-up study in Brazil. The spontaneous resolution rate for the cervico-facial macrocystic lymphatic malformations presenting at birth or later in life are 11.5% after 1-year follow-up study of 104 subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, which is comparable with 13% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> and 12.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The medical options available are sclerotherapy, minimally invasive surgical resection, laser therapy and radiofrequency ablation. Systemic pharmacological treatment with sirolimus (non-calcineurin-inhibiting immunosuppressant) is considered for patients with diffuse and infiltrative lymphatic malformations refractory to previous therapy and/or when surgical approach is not feasible due to the risk of permanent iatrogenic damage (e.g. blindness). According to the single case report of successful improvement of a complex periorbital venolymphatic malformation with sirolimus and prednisolone (Kim D. _et al._ in 2015) combined therapy that was initially failed to respond to the sildenafil treatment and sclerotherapy may have a place in management.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors would like to acknowledge the parents of the child described for allowing us to share his clinical details, and thank Dr Caroll, paediatric radiologist, at the Radiology Department of Furness General Hospital, for the advice and provision of radiology images and her team for providing proper images of the lesion and Cumbria Police for providing images of the lesion upon official request.

A negative prognostic role of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) has been noticed and is supported by the current case. We describe a male patient who at the age 40 suffered a cardiac arrest and over the following months experienced progressive heart failure, arrhythmias and proximal muscle weakness. Clinical, genetic and serologic testing and repeated imaging- and histopathological investigations resulted in a diagnosis of AMA-associated, necrotizing, inflammatory myositis with cardiac involvement. Besides a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, heart failure and antiarrhythmic drugs the patient received successive immunosuppressants, which improved skeletal muscle strength but not cardiac disease progression. At age 45 he died from end-stage heart failure. Clinicians must be aware of AMA-associated myositis as a cause of unclarified heart disease, even in patients with initially sparse extra-cardiac manifestations. Further knowledge of treatment strategies is highly needed for this disease entity.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Inflammatory myopathy is a heterogeneous disease entity affecting primarily the skeletal muscles.

He had no risk factors for ischemic heart disease. At arrival to the hospital, the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular extra systoles and q-waves in anterior leads . In hospital heart monitoring showed paroxysmal complete heart block. Blood tests revealed elevated troponin-T (262, \\[<14 ng/L\\]), creatine kinase (CK) myocardial band (46,1 \\[<7 μg/L\\]) and total CK (2530 \\[25–400 U/l\\]). Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) disclosed dilatation of left ventricle with ejection fractions (LVEF) of 25–30%, hypofunction of right ventricle and inferoseptal akinesia. Coronary angiography (CAG) showed normal coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed inferoseptal akinesia of the distal part of the myocardium in the left ventricle where late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was found in a subendocardial, almost transmural pattern . A Cardiac-Resynchronization-Therapy-Defibrillator device (CRT-D) was implanted, and anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, statin and heart failure therapy were started. The patient complained of muscle weakness for 2 years. Medical records showed elevated total CK (2000–3000 U/l) tracing back to 2014. Muscle strength testing confirmed proximal weakness of all extremities but no other signs of rheumatic/neurologic disease. The patient was subsequently followed by both cardiologists and neurologists, where progressive muscular weakness, repetitive supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and elevated cardiac/muscle enzymes were registered between 2016 and 2017 . Serological tests for myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) including anti-HMGCR, ANA and genetics for neuromuscular diseases were negative. Whole-body positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography (PET-CT) and pulmonary function tests were normal. Muscle biopsy showed fiber variability and cell necrosis compatible with immune-mediated, necrotizing myopathy. Prednisolone (75 mg/day) was initiated in January 2018 resulting in improved physical performance. In March 2018 methotrexate (MTX) (15–25 mg/week) was added and prednisolone tapered, resulting in continued clinical improvement and stable LVEF of 35%. In March 2019, while treated with MTX (20 mg/week) monotherapy, the patient experienced worsening of muscle weakness and dyspnea. Blood tests showed rising total CK  and X-ray revealed pulmonary congestion. The condition improved transitorily on diuretics and increased MTX (25 mg/week). Six months later, the patient was brought to intensive care in cardiogenic shock due to decompensated severe biventricular failure. He was stabilized by inotropic support, diuretics, amiodarone, upregulation of CRT pace and glucocorticoids. TTE depicted biventricular hypofunction/dilatation (LVEF 10–15%), and a cardiac PET-CT (F-18-FDG/Rb-82) showed nonviable perfusion defect in the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle . A myocardial biopsy revealed mild to moderate hypertrophy and maturing replacement fibrosis with alcian-positive matrix indicating the presence of glycosaminoglycans as seen in early regeneration. Furthermore, endothelial proliferation and a few inflammatory cells were seen in the biopsy, suggesting a recent loss of myocytes . Cyclosporine (200 mg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day) were added to prednisolone (15 mg/day) to attenuate any inflammatory component. Despite stable peripheral muscle function, no convincing cardiac effect appeared. The combination of heart disease and myositis led to test for AMA in April 2020. AMA were present in unmeasurable high titers (>220 \\[<4 kIU/L\\]), supporting a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy related to AMA-associated inflammatory myositis (AMA-IM). In May 2020 rituximab therapy was started but unfortunately no cardiac improvement was achieved. Due to severe chronic renal impairment and ultimately liver failure the patient was not a candidate for heart transplantation. He died in cardiogenic and septic shock in July 2020.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】AMA-IM is a rare and sparsely described disease entity occurring independently or along with other autoimmune conditions, especially PBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Two previous case series found AMA in 0.006 and 11.3%, respectively, of patients with inflammatory myopathy—a variation probably reflecting the limited amount of data in a rare entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Cardiac involvement of AMA-IM is a rather new recognition only described by a few, previous case reports/series within the last decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Little is known about the clinical and histopathological phenotype of AMA-IM. In consistency with our observations, previous cases report polymorph cardiac involvement including arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure as prominent clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>, and muscle biopsies with varying degrees of inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient developed PAF at age 35, which was perceived as a complication to Graves thyrotoxicosis. Retrospectively, PAF could have been an initial symptom of AMA-IM, as it continued despite normalization of thyroid function, and was succeeded by severe conduction abnormalities, rising total CK and decreasing muscle strength over the following years. Previous reports confirm that cardiac manifestations often precede muscle symptoms in AMA-IM, increasing the risk of misdiagnosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In our case, the diagnostic process was further challenged by ambiguous test results as MSAs and ANA screening appeared normal, and neither imaging nor biopsies showed active inflammation. The muscle biopsy showed a necrotizing myopathy, which was not associated to statin as Atorvastatin was prescribed years after the onset of muscle involvement and no anti-HMGCR antibodies were detected. In the endomyocardial biopsy, myocarditis was not directly observed. However, the focal loss of myocytes and replacement with alcian positive material as part of the regenerative process suggests a recent damaging event, which may be myocarditis. The CMRI findings of LGE following cardiac arrest could be due to coronary thromboembolism or an inflammatory process of the myocardium. The former seems unlikely given the normal coronary arteries on the previous CAG. Hence, the initially sparse muscle symptoms and prolonged diagnostic process with step-wise exclusion of genetic -, other rheumatic-, ischemic- and malignant diseases, before AMA testing provided a final diagnosis, caused a treatment delay, which might in part explain the insufficient cardiac responsiveness to immune suppressants in our patient. However, a diminished cardiac versus muscular response to immunosuppressants in AMA-IM has been observed in previous cases, across genders, disease durations and drug types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Taken together, this might point to a need for more aggressive strategies to reverse the cardiac manifestations.\n\n【15】In conclusion, our case supports that cardiac involvement can be a severe complication in AMA-IM and emphasizes the importance of testing for AMA in etiologically unclarified inflammatory myopathies and cardiac failure. The lack of treatment effect on cardiac failure in our and previous cases may indicate that very early and aggressive management of heart involvement is necessary.

There is no sign of changes in the immune status, but three herpes viruses were detected in the patient’s blood (EBV, HHV6 and HHV8). He received ABVD chemotherapy and achieved complete metabolic remission for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Moreover, the signs of the disseminated KS were resolved. Our observations indicate that a combination of distinct types of viruses may play an important role in triggering the development of angio- and lymphoproliferative disorders in the same person. In addition, treatment with chemotherapy cycles, which included doxorubicin and vinblastine, led to the stable remission of both diseases.\n\n【2】Kaposi sarcoma , Hodgkin’s lymphoma , EBV , HHV6 , HHV8\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade angio-proliferative mesenchymal disorder caused by the herpes virus of the eighth type (HHV8). The mechanisms of HHV8 action on the host cells are not fully understood, although the latest data suggest that HHV8 infects vascular endothelial cells, leading to cell reprogramming and transformation by the induction of the LJVE1, VEGFR3 and PDPN genes, whose expressions are pivotal for cancer development. Morphologically, KS consists of spindle cells carrying markers of the endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34), lymphatic epithelium cells (VEGFR3, D2-40 and LYVE-1), macrophages (CD68) and smooth muscles (SMA) and the marker of the viral damage (LANA-1; latency-associated nuclear Ag). The herpes virus is associated with KS and primary diffusion lymphoma and HIV-associated Castleman disease. The most common classical variant is typically characterized by a benign course. In 90% of cases, the affected organ is the skin with epithelia and internal organ involvement not exceeding 10%. Disseminated KS variants are more typical for HIV-positive patients, transplant recipients and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. We report a case of the disseminated form of KS in an HIV-negative patient diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) that was successfully treated.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|The KS images (A) on the hand and (B) on the feet finger.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Histology and IHC of KS specimens: (A) biopsy of a colonic KS lesion (H&E, original magnification 10x).

Since July 2017, he had periodically experienced upper abdominal pain and several episodes of black tarry stools associated with weight loss (10 kg over 5 months). His hemoglobin gradually dropped from 130 to 67 g/L. During the physical exam, reddish-blue nodules (up to 1 cm in diameter) were found on the right palm, fourth finger of the right hand and left foot, and multiple small (2–3 mm) round nodules were found in the subcutaneous fatty tissue of the upper and lower extremities . These skin lesions had existed for 4 years. The endoscopy showed multiple bright red polypoid lesions in the stomach. Similar changes were found in the duodenum. A colonoscopy revealed multiple large hyper-vascularized dark-reddish flat lesions. The colon, gastric and skin biopsies showed histological features of KS . The proliferating spindle cell expressed CD34 and PDPN . Anti-HHV8 antibodies were detected in the blood. A diagnosis of KS was made.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|PET scan imaging: (A) PET scan on January 2018 at the time of diagnosis, shoving hypermetabolic paraclavicularic, retropectoral and axillary lymph nodes .

His immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were in the normal range (IgA 1.95 g/L, IgG 8.87 g/L and IgM 0.69 g/L). Thus, no abnormalities in the immune status were detected. The patient was negative for HIV antibodies, but EBV DNA and HHV6 DNA were detected in the blood. Then, the patient was found with right axillary lymphadenopathy. In January 2018, a PET scan at the time of diagnosis showed hypermetabolic axillar and subclavicular lymphadenopathies . Morphological and immunohistochemical studies of the affected lymph node biopsy showed a picture of the nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). He received a total of five cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin 40 mg IV, KD 80 mg; bleomycin 15 mg IV/KD 30 mg; vinblastine 10 mg IV/KD 20 mg; and dacarbazine 600 mg, KD 1200 mg) during days 1–15 of the course. The PET scan in May 2018 revealed a complete metabolic response . The colonoscopy and endoscopy were normal. In December 2019, 19 months after the last ABVD course, our patient was still in complete remission of his lymphoma . The DNA of the EBV and HHV6 viruses became undetectable in the blood. No sign of KS recurrence was found in the gastrointestinal tract, but the patient had several new KS nodules on his right foot . The patient is under continuous observation.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Based on the cases described in the literature, it is possible to conclude that KS development is typically associated with a patient’s immunosuppression of different origins, such as HIV and/or herpes virus infections, post-transplantation therapy and anticancer chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, cases of KS in HIV-negative patients without deterioration of the immune status also have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. In the case of our patient, we did not find any changes in the immune status. All parameters were in the normal range: IgA 1.95 g/L, IgG 8.87 g/L, IgM 0.69 g/L, CD4 42.2% (N 36–55) and CD8 21.5% (N 17-37)). No concomitant immunosuppressive diseases or HIV infection was found. However, we found HHV6/EBV DNA and an antibody against the HHV8 virus in the patient’s plasma.\n\n【14】Every virus in this combination is involved in carcinogenesis. Moreover, KS is associated with HHV8, whereas EBV plays an important role in the development of classical HL (cHL), and HHV6 establishes latency in lymphocytes and possesses a strong immunomodulatory capacity that can trigger both immunosuppressive and chronic inflammatory pathways.\n\n【15】In our case, we made the NLPHL diagnosis using morphological and IHC studies . The NLPHL is a rare subtype of HL, representing 5% of all cases. In contrast to cHL, it is generally considered EBV negative (4–5% EBV-positive cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the biopsy of our patient, we found the EBV marker LMP1 and weak CD30 positive staining, which is typical for the EBV-positive NLPHL  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Hence, our patient had a rare type of HL associated with EBV.\n\n【16】These facts support the hypothesis that the combination of viruses plays a key role in the development of NLPHL and KS in our patient. The precise mechanism of this process is not yet clear, but the influence of EBV/HHV6/HHV8 on lymphoid cells may lead to the deterioration of the apoptotic process and the development of indolent immunodeficiency, which triggered the development of two neoplastic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, we would like to note an aggressive course of KS, which is atypical for HIV-negative patients. Multiple foci of skin lesions on the upper and lower extremities, damage to the gastrointestinal tract and, consequently, repeated bleeding provide a characteristic picture of the increasing anemia. In the literature, the recommended therapy for KS is liposomal doxorubicin, vinblastine and taxane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u> The patient’s polychemotherapy courses for the underlying disease (HL) contained the recommended doxorubicin and vinblastine. Thus, the therapy was equally successful in achieving the remission of both diseases: KS and HL. The patient remains in complete PET/CT remission for 19 months after the end of HL therapy. The KS lesions were not detected by the control colonoscopy and endoscopy, but new lesions appeared on the skin of the lower limb. The DNA of the herpes virus was not detected by the PCR. Further follow-up of the patient will continue.\n\n【17】Thus, we described for the first time the case of the parallel development of HL and KS on the background of the infection with three herpes viruses. This demonstrates the importance of viruses in cancer development, although further studies of the precise mechanisms are needed.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was approved by the ethical committee of the Main Military Clinical Hospital named after N.N.

On discontinuation of the PPIs, symptoms of LPR remained and the patient’s reflux symptoms returned with increased severity. Consumption of acacia gum exudates from _Acacia pycnantha_ resolved the LPR. _Acacia pycnantha_ or gum arabic were both found to reduced reflux symptoms to a manageable level. An evaluation of the therapeutic effect of acacia gums using questionnaires to evaluate reflux symptoms, quality of life and global refluxogenic scores was undertaken. It was found acacia gums can be taken after the evening meal in the same way as antacids to manage reflux symptoms but with more sustained overnight relief.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A significant number of people globally suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Over the counter antacids are used to relieve reflux symptoms associated with pain. If antacids are insufficient then proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the next choice for the treatment of reflux, GERD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and LPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PPIs are generally not intended for long-term use because of the potential for significant side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Acacia gums may provide long-term treatment options.\n\n【4】The exudative gum from _Acacia pycnantha_ (AP), Fig. 1 ) and _Acacia mearnsii_ endemic to southern regions of Australia, have been used as a food source and tonic by Australian Indigenous people for thousands of years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. _Acacia pycnantha_ (AP) is also known as the golden wattle and is the floral emblem of Australia. Exudative gum from acacia trees _Acacia senegal_ or _Acacia seyal_ that grow in northern African regions are classified as gum arabic (GA) or simply acacia gum. GA is an approved food additive, has a European food safety code E414 and does not require a numerical acceptable daily intake limit (ADI; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>). The chemical and physiochemical characteristics of 18 different acacia gum exudates have been characterized with AP and GA having the same chemical composition but different molecular weights and percentages of uronic acid and polysaccharides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The Cochrane Library database revealed 25 trials using typically 10–50 g GA per day over a period of 4–12 weeks and with between 10 and 100 participants but not in relation to reflux, GERD or LPR. Clinical trials report both gastrointestinal side effects and benefits from using GA and that no patients stopped GA because of these symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, no side effects were found to be reported for AP.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|_Acacia pycnantha_ in flower and gum exudates from the trunk.</u>\n\n【6】To evaluate the therapeutic effects of an antacid, PPIs and acacia gums as reflux treatments, three questionnaires have been used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The reflux symptom score (RSS) that provides an overall score for disorder frequency and severity of a complaint recalled over the previous month with zero being asymptomatic and with a maximum score of 625 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The quality of life impact (QOL) of a complaint, with zero having no impact to five having significant impact on life as recalled over the previous month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.

Evening meals with spicy foods, wine and coffee, all dietary triggers causing reflux in this individual, were avoided.\n\n【9】After noticing phonic speech changes, some hoarseness and some pain on swallowing, direct fiber-optic laryngoscopic examination revealed LPR. The PPI, esomeprazole was taken nightly for 8 weeks as acid suppression therapy. At the end of 8 weeks, two tablets of an antacid composed of CC, sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate were taken daily. Short-term use of PPIs due to potential adverse effects and subsequently lifelong use of antacids are currently an optimal therapeutic regime for patients with LPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】At the end of 8 weeks a limited improvement in the symptoms of LPR was noted with mild odynophagia persisting. Discontinuation of the PPIs resulted in significantly increased reflux symptoms despite taking antacids and may have been the result of acid rebound hypersecretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Awareness of the tonic effects of acacia gum, which had been consumed during childhood, gum exudates collected directly from the AP tree was self-administered soon after the discontinuation of the PPIs. The AP was taken as 5–15 g after the evening meal when reflux symptoms began and on demand in the same way antacids are used. Symptom relief was felt in 5–10 min.\n\n【12】Due to the commercial availability of food grade GA powder, the same quantities of GA were trialled and found to bring relief to reflux symptoms in the same way as AP.\n\n【13】To determine if it was necessary to use AP or GA it was decided to stop their use and return to CC only. After one night the patient reported reflux symptoms that could not be managed by CC alone and returned to using GA with immediate symptom relief.\n\n【14】No significant gastrointestinal or other side effects were noted. The patient completed several RSS, QOL and GRES questionnaires at different times to show trends in the therapeutic response, Fig. 2 .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|The therapeutic response to reflux symptoms from the change in the RSS, QOL and GRES scores. The initial reflux treatment was CC alone ( **A** ) followed by PPIs treatment for 8 weeks on diagnosis of LPR ( **B** ), PPIs discontinuation causing increased reflux symptoms uncontrolled by CC alone ( **C** ), management of reflux with AP and regular CC ( **D** ), management of reflux with AP or GA and occasional use of CC ( **E** ), discontinuation of AP and GA and a return to CC (A1) and finally management of reflux with GA alone. The 95% confidence intervals shown.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The order of treatments are labelled A–E, A1, F and evaluated using the RSS, QOL and GRES questionnaires, Fig. 2 .\n\n【18】The three questionnaires were completed at least three times each and on different days for each of the treatments (A–E, F) except only once and without the GRES score when the AP or GA was discontinued and CC tried for the one night (A1) during week 16.\n\n【19】From Fig. 2 , the RSS and QOL scores indicate that the reflux symptoms experienced over the past 10 years (A) were reduced by the PPIs (B), AP (D, E) and GA (F) over 19 weeks. On discontinuation of the PPIs (C) or the AP and GA (A1) reflux symptoms returned and could not be managed by CC alone. This suggests that PPIs or either of AP or GA is essential in the management of the patients reflux symptoms and that symptom improvement is not simply a time related improvement of a chronic condition. Anecdotal evidence from the patient also supports the therapeutic benefits of AP and GA. The patient claims that a high GRES scoring diet in the evening causes significant acute reflux symptoms and while the antacid CC will bring immediate temporary relief, acacia gums are found to bring immediate sustained overnight relief and allow undisturbed sleep.\n\n【20】Statistically there are no significant differences between the GRES scores for all of the treatments (A–E, A1 and F). Anecdotal evidence from the patient was used to explain the trends in the GRES scores. The decrease in the GRES score on the discontinuation of the PPIs (C) was due to the increased symptoms of reflux preventing the patient from having coffee and wine. As reflux symptoms decreased (D, E and F), the patient could return to daily coffee and wine lifting the GRES score reflecting tolerance to a more refluxogenic diet (D, E and F).\n\n【21】The importance of the case report is that the acacia gums AP or GA may offer a long-term treatment option for some individuals suffering reflux, GERD or LPR and who find antacids insufficient or that symptoms return after a treatment with PPIs.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTERESTS STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】No conflict of interest.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】The article adheres to ethical guidelines and local and legal requirements.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】Informed consent has been obtained from the patient who has read the manuscript and approved it for publication.

Here, we report a case that acetabular osteosarcoma progressed to the femoral head through the ligament of the femoral head (round ligament). We obtained written informed consent by the patient.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】Case: a 63-year-old male was presented with pain in the left proximal thigh. A tumor was suspected by X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【6】Imaging findings: X-ray showed slight uptake in the left acetabulum .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Frontal X-ray of the pelvis shows a radiolucent lesion in the left acetabulum.</u>\n\n【8】Computed tomography showed bone destruction images mainly in the left acetabulum extending to femoral head .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography images at the time of visit show bone destruction mainly in the left acetabulum, extending to the femoral head; ( **a** ) coronal, ( **b** ) axial.</u>\n\n【10】MRI revealed a multilocular lesion from left acetabulum to pubis . There was a slight accumulation of joint fluid. A lesion having similar abnormal signal was detected in the femoral head.

Tumor cells were fusiform or round shaped with atypical nuclei, often binucleated and scattered mitotic figures, suggesting high-grade sarcoma . After preoperative chemotherapy was started, a deterioration of renal function was observed, and therefore, the chemotherapy (cisplatin + doxorubicin) was stopped after one course. The surgery consisted of wide excision and femoral head replacement for tumor .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Preoperative biopsy specimen showed high-grade sarcoma, mainly with chondroid matrix.

The articular cartilage was not destructed by the tumor, neither on the acetabular side nor on the femoral head side. There was no tumor extending into the joint cavity . Final diagnosis was chondroblastic osteosarcoma with slight osteoid formation and little therapeutic effect . Histological findings were similar to the preoperative biopsied specimen. Microscopic examination confirmed the unique extension of tumor cells on the gross findings. The tumor invaded along to the ligament from the acetabular site to the femoral head .

As of 3 years after surgery, neither local recurrence nor metastasis has been observed.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】There have been few reports on progression of the extremity bone tumor across a joint. Simon has reported on the three mechanisms of progression into a joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. First, the tumor may directly invade and cross the articular cartilage. Second, sarcomas may extend around the articular cartilage, beneath the joint capsule, and into the joint. Finally, intra-articular penetration can occur by direct extension of the tumor through or around an osseous–tendinous junction of an intra-articular ligament, usually the cruciate ligaments. In addition, Simon proved progression through cruciate ligament histologically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Since then, progression of osteosarcoma of the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and sacroiliac joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u> have been reported occasionally.\n\n【21】Simon has reported that capillary vessels extending from the femur are distributed in cruciate ligaments and tumors progress through the ligament tissue directly. However, in the case of femoral head, it has been proved that the bloodstream distributes in round ligament disappeared at 6 months old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, and there has been no report on the progression of tumors in detail.\n\n【22】As for reports on progression of acetabular osteosarcoma extending to the femur, there have been only few reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. These reports were cases with no precise imaging findings and pathological findings. There were no reports showing whether or not the tumor had progressed through the round ligament. In our case, MRI revealed little accumulation of joint fluid and the structure of ligament components was maintained, which means that the tumor did not progress into the joint cavity, but progressed to the femoral head surrounding the ligament without destruction of the ligament . Gross observation of the resected specimen revealed that the tumor did not disseminate in the joint cavity . On the other hand, looking at the tissue specimen, the tumor cell in contact with the normal ligament reached the femoral head side, and the cell was considered to progress through some kind of structure adjacent to the ligament . Considering the findings of MRI and resected specimen and tissue specimen, in this case, we considered that the tumor cell did not disseminate in the joint cavity, but progressed between ligament and synovial tissue covering the ligament .\n\n【23】Since synovial fold existed on the surface of normal round ligament, there was a high possibility that the tumor progressed between ligament tissue and synovial fold. In addition, the synovial fold was considered to prevent the tumor from expanding into the joint cavity to some extent. Unlike cruciate ligament, blood vessels in the round ligament in adults had disappeared, and therefore, the tumor might have progressed through microvascular of the synovium between ligament and synovial fold covering the ligament, and not passing through the inside of the ligament.\n\n【24】Based on the findings stated above, this case suggested that the tumor might progress through the synovium around the ligament of femoral head in the cases of osteosarcoma arising from the proximal femur and acetabulum, even if accumulation of joint fluid or invasion to ligament is not obvious by imaging. Therefore, in acetabular osteosarcoma cases, we considered that it would be important to take into account the existence of the tumor progression when planning surgical margins.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has given written consent for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Seiichi Matsumoto, MD, PhD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The management of ACC varies depending on the lesion size, location and associated abnormalities. Small lesions often heal spontaneously, whereas larger lesions are significant and usually associated with additional anomalies in other organs. This paper reports three cases, which describe large lesions of ACC, presented with other abnormalities (Adams–Oliver syndrome, intestinal obstruction and heart defect). Particular attention should be paid to the patient with large lesions of ACC to investigate more congenital anomalies.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a rare cutaneous malformation characterized by a congenital absence of skin and in some cases subcutaneous tissues or bone. Lesions are usually found on the vertex of the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and sometimes in the limbs, abdomen or trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The appearance of the lesion widely varies from an atrophic, membranous alopecia scar to ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In this case series, we present three cases of ACC associated with limb anomalies, intestinal obstruction and a complex heart defect. Physicians must investigate internal organs involvement once they diagnose large lesions of ACC.\n\n【5】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【6】CASE 1: A female newborn was born by vaginal delivery at 40 weeks after a normal pregnancy. Physical examination revealed an irregularly shaped hemorrhagic defect measured (7 × 5) cm on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal occipital region . She also had many terminal limbs anomalies that include absence of toes, hypoplastic toes nails and one additional dead finger in the right hand . There was scar tissue on her abdomen . She was the fifth child of the non-consanguineous marriage, and her brothers did not suffer from any similar anomalies. Her 34-year-old mother did not take any medication during gestation. There were no abnormalities in the family relatives. Computed tomography scan of the head showed an absence of the skin and bone of the scalp . She died before doing more investigations. The combination of the scalp defect with terminal limbs anomalies suggests a diagnosis of Adams–Oliver syndrome (AOS).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** & **B** ) ACC appears as a hemorrhagic large defect extending over the occipital and parietal regions.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** , **B** & **C** ) Terminal limb anomalies; absence of toes, hypoplastic toes nails and additional dead finger in the hand.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Scar tissue on the abdomen.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|The CT scan shows an absence of the skin and bone of the scalp.</u>\n\n【11】CASE 2: A female newborn was born at 40 weeks by a caesarian section after an uncomplicated pregnancy.

While monitoring her, she suffered from a delay in the passing of meconium. A contrast barium enema showed an intestinal obstruction , and urgent nasogastric intubation had been done . She died, so we could not do other investigations. The family history detected that she was the first child of the non-consanguineous marriage, and her mother did not take any medication during her pregnancy.

Chest auscultation showed a high pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternum edge with a fixed split in the second heart sound. She was the third child of the non-consanguineous marriage.

The family history of congenital anomalies was negative.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】The specific etiology of Aplasia cutis congenita is not clear yet. Chromosomal abnormalities, especially BMS1, trauma, intrauterine infection and teratogens in pregnancy are possible causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. ACC has been classified into nine types; some are associated with other abnormalities or genetic syndromes, such as AOS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The management of ACC varies depending on the lesion size and location. For small uncomplicated lesions, conservative management includes wound cleaning and using antibiotics. However, larger lesions may need urgent surgery because of the high risk of infection and bleeding.\n\n【25】In addition, large lesions ≥4 cm can also be associated with underlying defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our paper, the focus of attention is on three sporadic cases of ACC with large lesions (7 × 5) cm, (8 × 6) cm and (4 × 3) cm, which are accompanied by additional internal abnormalities.\n\n【27】The first case is about a female newborn diagnosed with AOS. AOS is a rare multiple organ disorder with an incidence rate estimated at 1 of 225 000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The typical clinical manifestation of AOS is ACC associated with limb defect. Other extra anomalies include cutis marmorata, telangiectasia congenita and additional malformations in the internal organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Many genetic mutations predispose to AOS, such as mutations in EOGT, DOCK6 DLL4, ARHGAP31, RBPJ and NOTCH1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Limb defects are commonly bilateral and asymmetrical, with lower extremities affected more than upper extremities. A Brachydactyly is the most common limb defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The scar tissue on her abdomen probably represents an ACC lesion, which formed and scarred intrauterine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The second case is about a female newborn diagnosed with ACC associated with intestinal obstruction. Physicians highly suspected intestinal obstruction in a neonate who failed to pass the meconium within the first 24 h. It has many probable causes such as atresia, stenosis, malrotation and others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The association between intestinal obstruction and ACC may be caused by a mutation in ITGP4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The third case is about a female diagnosed with ACC associated with many congenital heart defects. The appearance of her aplasia cutis lesion was as an alopecic scar, and this is due to its formation early in the gestation so it can heal before the delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The incidence rate of congenital heart disease in neonates with heart murmurs ranges from 22 to 86% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, so echo in neonates with murmurs is very useful for the early diagnosis and treatment. In most cases, congenital heart diseases are isolated, but they may be associated with extracardiac anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The combination of ACC with CHDs may suggest the diagnosis of AOS even though the absence of skeletal malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】It is evident from this case series that ACC of 4 cm or greater is significantly associated with other underlying congenital defects. Thus, for large lesions of ACC, it is strongly suggested to investigate for other congenital malformations.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PATIENT CONSENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The literature shows increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects. We present a 57-year-old woman with stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma who received treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. She had disease progression on maintenance immunotherapy, confirming resistance. Palliative radiation to the sternal bone lesion resulted in a significant response to all areas of cancer, confirming the abscopal effect. Unfortunately, she developed severe pneumonitis; to our knowledge, this is the first case of abscopal lung toxicity.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The word abscopal was first used by Mole in 1953, meaning ‘at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The abscopal effect describes tumor responses outside the irradiated field, a rare phenomenon. A recent literature review of the abscopal effect between 1969 and 2014 detected only 46 cases, even though millions of patients are being treated worldwide with radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Local radiation plays a wide range of roles in cancer treatment and helps reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery, curative treatment and palliation of symptoms. Ionizing radiation (IR) causes DNA damage by several mechanisms, such as producing reactive oxygen species and DNA double-stranded breaks. The latter is the principal mechanism by which IR induces DNA damage. There is evidence of increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects, and several prospective studies are trying to study this phenomenon.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old female with a 37-pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department complaining of right-sided abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous liver with numerous nodules concerning metastatic disease. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 1.8 cm spiculated left upper lobe lung nodule, several lytic bone lesions and extensive hepatic metastatic disease .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computerized tomography showing left lung spiculated nodule and multiple liver metastatic lesions.</u>\n\n【7】A biopsy of the liver lesion showed nests and clusters of polygonal-shaped tumor cells with irregular nuclei and copious amounts of finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase stains revealed positive cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1. Tumor cells were negative for p40 and hep par-1 stains, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from lung primary. Laboratory data showed elevated liver enzymes and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Next-generation sequencing of the tumor revealed no actionable mutation, PD-L1 ˂1% with a tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 97th percentile. She started carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab with monthly denosumab injections. After four treatment cycles restaging scan showed a treatment response, and she continued maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months on maintenance therapy, the CEA started trending up, and she noticed worsening fatigue and sternal pain. Pemetrexed was discontinued to help with fatigue. A PET-CT scan showed significant progression with left upper lobe primary carcinoma, an extensive hepatic metastatic disease with most liver parenchyma replaced by tumor and progressive bone metastasis, including a large lesion in her sternal bone . She started palliative radiation for the sternal lesion and received 2500 cGy in five fractions while continuing pembrolizumab. Clinically she noticed significant resolution of sternal pain and fatigue and decided against changing systemic therapy. A total of 8 weeks after radiation, a bone scan revealed reduced activity in the sternum. However, a PET-CT scan surprisingly showed significant improvement in liver lesions  and a corresponding improvement in CEA. One month later, she was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and severe hypoxia, with CT showing evidence of pneumonitis . Grade 2 immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis was suspected, and immunotherapy was held. She received a tapering systemic corticosteroid regimen, steadily improving her symptoms. Immunotherapy was rechallenged per guideline-directed management (American Society of clinical oncology—Management of Immunotherapy Toxicity 2021). Unfortunately, rechallenging resulted in recurrent pneumonitis; hence, we discontinued treatment permanently. At her last follow-up, she appeared clinically well 6 months after stopping immunotherapy. A PET-CT showed no fluorodeoxyglucose activity in the liver, lungs and bones.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Positron emission tomography **(A)** Showing diffuse liver metastasis, lung nodule and a sternal bone metastatic lesion confirming disease progression. **(B)** Eight weeks of radiation therapy showing resolution of activity in the liver, lung nodule and sternal bone lesion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Computerized tomography showing areas of consolidation bilaterally consistent with pneumonitis.</u>\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】The natural anticancer response is partly mediated by dendritic cells presenting new antigens to T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cancer cells evade the body’s immune response by impairing T-cell activity and dendritic-cell mediated stimulation of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1). T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors that overcome this include anti-programmed cell death protein 1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 monoclonal antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, commonly termed immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has been particularly promising in patients with high PD-L1 scores and higher tumor mutational burden 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had a high TMB, and she had an expected initial response to pembrolizumab. One of the crucial factors for the abscopal effect is the presence of infiltrating T cells; the higher presence has a positive association with the impact. Radiation therapy is well known to induce DNA damage which is believed to be responsible for triggering the immune system but is also a central mechanism for initiating the abscopal effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The damaged cells release neo-antigens that prime and activate the cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, which migrate and infiltrate the metastases outside the irradiated field, resulting in tumor regression.\n\n【12】A study of lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab showed improved survival when they had a history of previous radiation compared to patients who did not receive radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The PACIFIC trial evaluating consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients showed better survival outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy without significantly increasing immune-related side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In contrast, a study of patients with NSCLC treated with concurrent immunotherapy (durvalumab–tremelimumab) and radiation showed no significant difference in patients receiving different doses of radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Note that the patients in this study were pretreated with immunotherapy, and these findings raise doubts about radiation as a modality to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Despite contrary observations, our patient had an excellent abscopal response after palliative radiation and likely overcame immunotherapy resistance. Similar observations have been noted in multiple case studies. A unique feature of our case is diffuse pneumonitis that we firmly believe is an abscopal toxicity from systemic immune activation after radiation outside the lung. We described this unique phenomenon of distant effect as ‘abscopal toxicity’ (toxicity in the organ not exposed to irradiation field) since this finding is novel and has not been described in the literature. Our patient tolerated immunotherapy well without any side effects until she received radiation. Another critical factor is that our patient received palliative dose radiation to the sternum and never received radiation to the lung fields. We did not identify any case of abscopal pneumonitis in our literature search.\n\n【13】Regarding other abscopal toxicities, we found one other case reported in a patient exhibiting bullous pemphigoid after receiving palliative radiation while on treatment with nivolumab for renal cell cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We believe it is essential to be aware of abscopal toxicity as some of these toxicities can appear at a distant site and result in significant morbidity. Immunotherapy resistance is an area that needs timely research as many patients stop responding after some time. Although case studies like ours suggest radiation could overcome the resistance, there is a need for an accurate biomarker to identify patients who will benefit from this.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data is available on request to the corresponding author.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Aswanth Reddy, MD (Corresponding author).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Twelve hours after streptokinase adminstration, the patient developed severe hemoptysis and dyspnea and radiological studies were highly suggestive for acute alveolar hemorrhage. His past medical history is significant for severe chest trauma ten months prior to presentation. Conservative therapy in addition to anti-coagulants withdrawal has led to gradual improvement in the next six days. We also discussed the aspects of our patient in comparison with published cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by intra-alveolar bleeding.

However, it is associated with a non-negligible risk of bleeding involving the visceral organs such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, vascular access sites and intracranial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】AH following thrombolytic therapy is an extremely rare entity that has only been reported in 22 patients through the medical literature.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 64-year old Caucasian male presented to our emergency department with a compliant of 6-hour retrosternal constricting chest pain with nausea and diaphoresis. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm of acute anterior STEMI. After appropriate loading of aspirin and clopidogrel, the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and streptokinase 1.5million units was administrated. His chest pain resolved within three hours with minimal response to thrombolytic therapy on electrocardiogram. Unfortunately, rescue-PCI is not available in our country, thus the patient was continued on medical therapy.\n\n【8】His past medical history was significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (treated with bisoprolol 5 mg) and a multiple trauma caused by a car accident ten months ago. His trauma caused seven rib fractures (four in the left, three in the right), pneumothorax, severe lung contusion, three vertebral fractures in the lateral process and hip fracture. He underwent thoracothentesis, vertebral fixation and total hip replacement and was discharged in a good condition with a mild pleural effusion on chest X-ray (CXR) and no pulmonary complaints.\n\n【9】Twelve hours after streptokinase administration, the patient experienced a severe acute hemoptysis, moderate dyspnea, respiratory rate elevation to thirty breath per minute, oxygen saturation drop (97%to 89%) and hemoglobin drop (12.8 mg/dL to 11.2 mg/dL) without any other source of bleeding. Laboratory tests were otherwise normal. He had no hyperthermia or other signs of pneumonia. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral basal to middle crackles without any other signs or symptoms of heart failure. Thus, the patient was initially treated with intravenous furosemide and increasing dose of nitrate without response.\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography revealed hypokinesia in anterior wall and intraventricular septum with a 40% ejection fraction.\n\n【11】Bedside CXR demonstrated the presence of alveolar opacities involving the central portion of the lungs, particularly in the middle and lower lobes with mild pleural effusion, which directed us to the diagnosis of AH. 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[ Figure 1 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Bedside CXR.

On day six, CXR demonstrated normal lung fields. On day seven, the patient was discharged home on aspirin mono-antiplatelet therapy taking into consideration the bilateral nature, severe chest trauma, and thus a potential risk of recurrence.\n\n【15】Follow-up of the patient for sixty days was uneventful and coronary angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the left anterior\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest Computerized Tomography.

The clinical course of the disease have a wide spectrum from asymptomatic mild cases to abrupt fetal cases of severe respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of revascularization of acute STEMI when P-PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The main considerations of these agents remain the bleeding risk and allergic reactions. Bleeding is reported to occur in (0.2–5.9%) of patient; mainly from puncture sites, visceral cavities as gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum and intracranial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, the unavailability of P-PCI and other thrombolytic agents, makes streptokinase the only thrombolytic method in our country.\n\n【21】Chang YC et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> retrospectively reviewed 2634 patients with acute STEMI who received thrombolytic therapy and reported that hemoptysis has occurred in 11 patients (0.4%). However, frank AH is an extremely rare entity. Ben Murad et al review of the English medical literature revealed only 22 patients until date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Surprisingly all 23 patients (including ours) were males, which posted the male gander as a predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Moreover, streptokinase was the thrombolytic agent in 16 out of 23 patients (69.5%). This can be contributed to the non-specificity of thrombolysis that is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in comparison with other specific fibrinolytic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, the immune reactions of streptokinase that varies from simple allergy to anaphylactic shock can be a contributing factor. It was suggested that immune-mediated capillaritis could be a possible etiology of AH following streptokinase administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. According to Ben Murad review, only five fetal cases out of 23 cases were reported with a mortality rates of 21.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hammoudeh et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported a similar case of a unilateral AH in a patient with an ipsilateral chest trauma two years prior to the infarction. Taking into consideration that the trauma of our patient was bilateral. We believe that the severe trauma of our patient might have been a contributing factor of the AH. A possible etiology might be fibrinolysis state against any hemostating clot disassembling any bleeding from site of recent vascular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The main differential diagnosis of post-thrombolytic AH is acute pulmonary edema due to either heart failure or mechanical complications, which can delay the diagnosis as in our patient. Differential diagnosis also includes thromboembolism, pneumonia and autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Treatment options include both conservative management with respiratory support and blood transfusion; and causative management by withdrawal of all antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and, in severe cases the administration of tranexamic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】DECLARATION\n-----------\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding for this article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mardenli M was responsible for conception, critical revision of the manuscript for content and supervision.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ghabally M was responsible for conception, design, acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Horo B was responsible for critical revision of the manuscript, acquisition and design.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Alkhatib Q has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Raee M has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors reviewed and contributed to the final version of this case report.

The earliest detectable abnormality in TA is a thickening of the vessel wall, but diffuse aortic wall calcification is very rare and is a late manifestation. Besides, the involvement of the coronary arteries is not a common finding in TA and frequently involves the right coronary artery (RCA). Multi-modality imaging has a fundamental role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and its complications. In this report, we want to present an unusual case with TA, diffuse aortic wall calcification and left main coronary artery ostial lesion, which is a rare combination.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu Arteritis (TA) is a type of vasculitis affecting aorta and its major branches, thought to result from an autoimmune process that targets large elastic-containing arteries. TA affects women eight times more frequently than men. Chronic inflammation of the vessel walls leads to aneurysm formation, stenosis or thrombosis. Cardiac involvement occurs eventually in nearly one-third of patients. Myocarditis also occurs in TA and causes potentially reversible congestive heart failure (CHF). Conventional angiography is invasive and provides the least sensitive method for visualizing wall thickness. Ultrasonography, and to a lesser degree, computed tomography (CT) can detect this early vessel wall thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can identify vessel wall thickening, stenosis, as well as aneurysm formation. Additionally, multi-parametric cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging assists in determining cardiac involvement, including myocarditis. In this article, we want to present a new case of TA with atypical features including diffuse aortic wall calcification, left main (LM) coronary artery ostial thickening, as well as myocarditis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old man, from Mazandaran, Iran referred to our hospital with a 4-month history of palpitation and dyspnea (NYHA functional class II). The patient had no medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. Also, no history of smoking or alcohol use, as well as shortness of breath and chest pain and angina symptoms during exercise was detected. However, he had a history of sudden cardiac death in his brother at the age of 37 years old, with no evaluation. Moreover, he had no evidence of arthralgia, fever, headache or dermatologic manifestation at the time of presentation. On clinical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg in both upper limbs, pulses were easily palpable, and there were no bruits. A systolic murmur with an intensity of II/VI heard at the apex and a diastolic murmur also heard in the aortic position with III/VI intensity. Furthermore, a small left cervical lymphadenopathy (short-axis diameter: 10 mm) was detected with no erythema or pain.\n\n【6】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, wright, coombs wright, 2-mercaptoethanol, the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests, lipid profile, liver function test and thyroid hormone levels were within a normal range. Notably, his hemoglobin level was 12.5 g/dl.\n\n【7】Since some researches have suggested an overlap between tuberculosis and TA, tuberculin test, sputum smear and culture for mycobacterium was carried out, which were all negative.\n\n【8】The echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with global left ventricular (LV) hypokinesia, mild LV enlargement, and moderate mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves regurgitation. To evaluate the coronary arteries, CT angiography was performed, which determined diffuse media thickening of the aortic root (5 mm), and a significant narrowing of the LM ostium . Besides, it displayed evidence of aneurysmal dilation of ascending aorta with extensive aortic wall calcification along its course . In this regard, coronary angiography confirmed CT results .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|CT and angiography in TA.

(C) Invasive coronary angiography shows significant LM ostial stenosis (arrow).</u>\n\n【10】CMR examination indicated severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, localized myocardial inflammation and subepicardial fibrosis in the inferior and anteroseptal LV wall in favor of active myocarditis . Furthermore, there was evidence of aortic wall thickening . In the MRA, aortic arch branches showed mild irregularity and focal narrowing, whereas the celiac trunk  and right renal artery had significant stenosis at their origin. In addition late gadolinium enhancement sequence revealed fibrosis of the aortic wall .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CMR sequences in TA.

(D) Late gadolinium enhancement image in basal short-axis view demonstrates LV lateral wall fibrosis.</u>\n\n【12】Considering the mentioned findings (active inflammation of the aortic wall, myocardium, and LM stenosis as well as laboratory findings), all probable differential diagnoses evaluated by an expert rheumatologist, and ultimately the diagnosis of TA considered for the patient.\n\n【13】Regarding the clinical signs, findings of disease activity on CMR in both aorta and myocardial tissue, and decreased EF, intensive medical treatment selected for the patient.\n\n【14】The therapy started with 500 mg of methylprednisolone for 3 consecutive days and then continued at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, equivalent to 30 mg, daily, and reduced to 10 mg within 6 months.\n\n【15】In addition to steroid therapy, cyclophosphamide started for the patient at a dose of 500 mg for 3 consecutive months. The patient had two children and agreed to take the drug. However, we sent the patient’s sperm to the sperm bank for storage. Subsequently, treatment with injectable methotrexate at a dose of 20 mg per week continued. Due to CHF, anti-TNF drugs were not appropriate for the patient.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】TA is an idiopathic vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its branches, which results in the increased wall thickness of arteries, fibrosis, stenosis, aneurysmal formation or dilation, and thrombosis. In this report, we present an interesting case of TA diagnosed with a multi-modality imaging approach that had a combination of LM coronary artery involvement, entire aortic wall calcification, significant stenosis of the celiac trunk, and myocarditis, which is a rare combination in TA. Signs and symptoms characterizing the vascular inflammatory stage include, but not limited to, fatigue, fever, malaise, palpitation, headache, rash, hemoptysis and weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, disease activity may persist in the aortic wall, despite the patient being asymptomatic and all inflammatory markers may remain within normal limits. Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a marker of long-standing inflammation in TA, which is a very rare finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Coronary arteries, like other aortic branches, are involved in TA in 6–30% of cases. The right coronary artery is the most affected one. The most common site of coronary artery involvement is the ostium and proximal segments of the right and left coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The optimal coronary revascularization method for Takayasu patients is not known yet. Wong _et al._ concluded that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is better than percutaneous coronary intervention because the restenosis rate and major adverse cardiovascular events are more in PCI procedure than the CABG. More than a 9-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in the percutaneous procedure than CABG reported in this study. On the other hand, CABG in patients with TA has many difficulties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Because the left subclavian and internal mammary arteries are commonly affected, a saphenous vein graft is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. For the first time, Kuijer _et al._ reported a case in which a Dacron prosthetic patch utilize to insert the proximal anastomosis on an inflamed aorta. The patch prevented contact between inflamed tissue and the graft. They believe that in this way, the risk of graft failure will be reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Oishi _et al._ reported successful repair of ostial coronary artery stenosis using a femoral artery patch in Takayasu arteritis. It would be a reasonable surgical method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Therefore, three common surgical approaches are CABG, patch angioplasty of the LM coronary artery ostium, and transaortic coronary ostial endarterectomy. Although surgery is prohibited during the active stage of the inflammation, in a patient with unstable angina, it is applicable.\n\n【21】Hybrid CABG is an alternative technique. Preoperative stent insertion and subsequent off-pump CABG perform in the hybrid method. In the presence of the macroscopic calcification of the ascending aorta, conventional CABG is not the preferred technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thus, the Hybrid procedure is useful in patients with porcelain aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. As an alternative method, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can perform in Takayasu’s disease. This procedure has been offered in high-risk patients who refuse surgery or have severe pulmonary hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Because of the underlying inflammation and the higher rate of in-stent restenosis, interventional therapy was more associated with the re-interventions rate than the surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a late and rare manifestation of Takayasu arteritis. Multi-modality imaging using cardiac CT and CMR has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and portrays its complications.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this study.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors mention that they have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to the data gathering and writing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study has ethical approval from the ethics committee of Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Fever started 3 weeks before admission. Her medical history was unremarkable except for untreated AD since childhood. She denied recreational drug use and any recent medical and dental procedures. At initial presentation, she looked distressed. Her vital signs included body temperature, 38.1°C; blood pressure, 96/49 mmHg; heart rate, 85 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% (room air). Her skin was generally dry; scales and scratch scars were observed on the upper extremities. Heart murmur was not heard on auscultations. No physical finding indicating IE was observed. Blood examination revealed elevated white blood cell counts (10 600/μL; normal range: 3800–9100/μL) and C-reactive protein levels of 11.20 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL). Her serum creatinine level was within the normal range and urinalysis showed absence of proteinuria, hematuria and bacteriuria. Chest X-ray and electrocardiography showed no abnormalities. Methicillin-sensitive _S. aureus_ (MSSA) was isolated from all three sets of blood cultures and a smear culture of the skin on Day 2, which were obtained during admission. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed on the same day as the screening test for IE; it revealed a large mobile vegetation adhered near the annulus of the posterior mitral leaflet . Mitral regurgitations (MR) and left-to-right shunts were not observed and the ejection fraction was preserved (72%). Although intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 8 h) and vancomycin (1 g every 12 h) were continued from the time of admission, medication was switched to intravenous cefazolin (2 g every 8 h) on Day 2 based on the causative organism. The patient became afebrile on Day 3. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed on Day 7 and a large vegetation was still observed without MR . Although the patient did not have any neurological abnormalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head performed on Day 5 revealed two small lesions indicating septic emboli . Abscess formation and other embolic lesions were not detected on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) on the same day. Although the risk of further septic embolization was considered, the patient refused surgical intervention. The vegetation was followed-up by TTE; the size of the vegetation gradually decreased without any new abnormal findings on repeated MRI and contrast-enhanced CT performed on Days 18 and 21, respectively. TEE performed on Day 42 showed resolution of the vegetation . The skin condition also improved with the use of betamethasone dipropionate and heparinoid creams during hospitalization. Antibiotic therapy 通用删除1(英):<u>(total 6 weeks after confirming negative conversion of blood cultures on Day 3)</u> was completed; the patient was discharged without any complications.

S. aureus colonized the skin of >90% of patients with AD, compared with 10% of healthy individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This fact could explain why _S. aureus_ is the most common causative organism in patients with AD-associated IE Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment, including antibiotic treatment and surgery, are critical because IE caused by _S. aureus_ is associated with more severe clinical manifestations than IE caused by other organisms, with higher rates of preoperative embolic events and preoperative strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Fukunaga _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reviewed cases of cardiovascular surgery performed at their faculty and reported that the incidence of AD among patients with IE was 6.7% and the mean age was significantly lesser in patients with IE with AD than in those without AD (28.4 vs. 53.7 years). Yamamoto _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reviewed nine previously reported cases of AD-associated IE in addition to their own case and reported _S. aureus_ as the causative organisms in all cases; almost all cases (90%) required surgery. Yamamoto _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported on a patient with AD-associated IE who had a total of five recurrences of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Improvement of skin conditions could be a key to lowering the risk of IE in patients with AD and preventing recurrent infections. Considering the increased prevalence of AD in industrialized countries (15–30% in children and 2–10% in adults) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, attention always should be paid to the risk of IE in patients with AD, particularly those with untreated and uncontrolled disease.\n\n【13】Our case was unique in that the patient exhibited a good clinical course with antibiotic therapy alone, even though she had a large left-sided vegetation and intracranial complications due to MSSA, for which a surgical intervention may usually be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We considered the location of the vegetation (near the annulus of posterior mitral leaflet) might contribute to a good clinical course in the present case. Attention should be paid to skin conditions of patients with IE if the causative organism is _S. aureus_ , particularly in young patients.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to the clinical microbiological technicians of Kariya Toyota General Hospital, Aichi, Japan, who support our daily clinical practice.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no funding for this report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Hibi Arata.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms commenced following 3 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, with the first cycle given ~9.5 weeks prior to presentation. The patient was managed with immunosuppressive therapy including high dose methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin, antibiotics and optimal skin care, and achieved excellent recovery of the skin lesions with minimal sequelae. This rare occurrence of pembrolizumab-induced TEN has only been reported previously in a few cases with limited evidence on management. Given the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the long half-life of these agents, our case highlights the importance of recognizing this complication and of a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Immunotherapy has become an integral component of treatment regimens for various malignancies. Prolonged immune activation can lead to acute, long-term or progressive immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) over time. The overall rates of cutaneous toxicity for programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors are 34–42%, 15–20% and 50–70%, respectively. Most reactions are mild, but severe grade 4 reactions, including Steven–Johnson’s Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurs in < 1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】SJS and TEN are rare, life-threatening immune-mediated cutaneous reactions with a mortality rate of up to 30%. TEN is almost exclusively caused by medications whereas SJS can rarely be triggered by infectious agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. SJS/TEN presents with rapidly progressing painful, blistering detachment of the epidermis with the time to maximum epidermal detachment being ~7–10 days. The distinction between both is by the body surface area involvement (BSA), with SJS being < 10%, TEN >  30% and 10–30% being considered as SJS/TEN overlap.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】Patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma involving the omentum, liver and multiple intracranial lesions. PD-L1 expression was 80% and tests for driver mutations were negative. He completed gamma knife radiosurgery to the brain lesions prior to commencing systemic treatment with pembrolizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed. Cycle 1 of treatment was given ~9.5 weeks (66 days) before admission and the third cycle was given 17 days earlier. His other medications included perindopril, oxycodone and levetiracetam, the latter commenced post gamma knife for seizure prophylaxis.\n\n【7】The patient presented with widespread painful lichenoid eruption with small blisters and atypical targetoid lesions involving the chest, back, limbs, palms and soles . Haemorrhagic crusts were seen on the lips with no oral ulcers or ocular involvement. Total BSA involved was >30% with a positive Nikolsky sign. The lesions rapidly progressed over the next few days with epidermal detachment, confluence of the blisters and genital erosion. Histopathology of a skin biopsy showed acute cytotoxic lichenoid reaction characterized by zones of confluent epidermal necrosis, subepidermal vesicle formation and numerous basal and suprabasal apoptotic keratinocytes with some follicular involvement consistent with SJS/TEN . Tests for potential infectious culprits including varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C were negative.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Widespread lichenoid eruption, de-epithelialization, blistering and atypical targetoid lesions involving the chest, back, upper limbs, lower limbs, palms and soles.

He received 7 days of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 3 mg/kg daily, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg given in divided doses over 3 and 7 days of oral cyclosporin 150 mg BD. Supportive measures with intensive skin care regimens, daily ophthalmology reviews, antihistamines, packed red blood cell transfusions, IV fluids and analgesia were implemented throughout.\n\n【11】The skin lesions progressed and reached a plateau ~1.5 weeks into his admission followed by gradual re-epithelialization. He was subsequently stepped down to oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg, which was gradually weaned off after 1 month. He achieved excellent recovery with complete skin re-epithelialization and no long-term sequelae . He was not rechallenged with any systemic therapy for his non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was managed as an outpatient with best supportive cares and regular follow ups. The patient passed away 5 months post discharge from disease progression.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】We identified three potential culprits in our case—pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and levetiracetam.\n\n【14】The rates of any irAEs are tumour-specific and occur most frequently in the treatment of melanoma and NSCLC, with inconsistent correlation between dose and toxicity across previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There were 18 reported cases of PD-1/PD-L1-induced SJS or TEN in the literature. Of those, pembrolizumab was the causative factor for four cases of SJS and one case of TEN. Amongst all the cases, there were no deaths for the 13 cases of SJS but 3 out of 5 cases of TEN were fatal, including the solitary case of TEN caused by pembrolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The cases were treated with a combination of varying doses of corticosteroids, infliximab, IVIG, cyclosporin and plasmapheresis. The median time of onset for SJS/TEN in pembrolizumab was 11 weeks and the delayed reaction may be explained by the long half-life of 14–27 days which reaches steady state only by approximately Week 18–19 with 3 weekly infusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted antifolate chemotherapeutic agent. Antifolate cytotoxic skin reaction (ACSR) is a known side effect mainly comprizing of mild cutaneous rash occurring shortly after antifolate agent administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Only six cases of non-fatal SJS/TEN-like skin reactions have been attributed to pemetrexed in the treatment of NSCLC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–9 \\]</u>. Levetiracetam is a newer generation non-aromatic anti-epileptic drug (AED) often considered as a safer substitute for those who had skin reactions to older AEDs. Cases of SJS/TEN attributed to levetiracetam are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The number of SJS/TEN cases due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were far greater compared to pemetrexed or levetiracetam, despite the latter two drugs being used for a much longer duration. In our case, TEN occurring after cycle 3 of treatment is also consistent with the average time to onset associated with pembrolizumab. Therefore, we concluded that pembrolizumab is the most likely causative agent.\n\n【17】Management of SJS/TEN is largely supportive, relying on identification and prompt removal of the inciting agent, management in a burns unit, good skin and wound care along with multi-disciplinary consultations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Trials for steroids and immunomodulatory therapies in non-ICI-induced SJS/TEN have shown mixed survival or prognostic benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On the contrary, guidelines for skin-related irAEs rely heavily on corticosteroids with addition of other immunomodulatory agents for steroid-refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thus, the ideal management and prognosis for ICI-related SJS/TEN remains an uncharted territory.\n\n【18】In conclusion, severe grade 4 skin-related irAEs are rare but important life-threatening conditions which needs prompt recognition and treatment. ICIs have a long half-life which can lead to delayed onset irAEs, therefore a high index of suspicion should be maintained throughout the course of treatment. The ideal immunosuppressive agent, optimal dosing and duration is unclear, and treatment should be tailored towards disease response. Given the severity, we would recommend an aggressive immune suppressive, multi-disciplinary approach as used in other severe ICI toxicities.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【20】No conflict of interest.\n\n【21】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【22】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【23】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【24】Patient’s next-of-kin has reviewed the case content and provided written consent for patient’s case to be published with this journal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It constitutes ~2% of all lymphoid neoplasms and is divided into two main categories: anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK)+ALCL and ALK–ALCL that is recognized by the absence of ALK expression and mostly affects men at older ages. Thus, in this report we present a rare case of ALK-negative ALCL (ALK–ALCL) that was described and diagnosed in a 13-year-old girl in the mediastinum. Highlighting the rarity of manifestation at younger ages and the importance of using immunohistochemical staining in the differential diagnosis of this lymphoid neoplasm.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that was first identified by Stein _et al_ . in 1985 as a neoplastic entity of large cells with abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei. ALCL affects both nodal and extra nodal sites and constitutes ~15% of pediatric NHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Systemic ALCL is the most common type and mostly affects men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It’s categorized into two main subtypes according to the expression of a protein called anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK): ALK-positive ALCL which is more common in young adults, while ALK-negative ALCL tends to affect older males with a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Herein, we report a rare case of a 13-year-old girl who was diagnosed with an ALK-negative ALCL in the mediastinum with regards to pathological and immunohistochemical features of this neoplasm.\n\n【6】### CASE REPORT\n\n【7】We report a case of a 13-year-old Syrian girl who was admitted to the hospital on 16/7/2018 due to dysphagia, dyspnea, edema in the face, pallor and asthenia. Clinical examination revealed large masses in the mediastinum causing symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome. Blood examination showed WBC count 6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocyte count 48%, neutrophil count 42%, hemoglobin count 85 g/L and CRP 117.\n\n【8】Chest radiography revealed an abnormal shadow in the mediastinum extending to pulmonary hilar region . Furthermore, CT scan demonstrated large masses in the anterior mediastinum  with no other masses elsewhere. Thus, our patient underwent surgery on 30 July 2018 for complete resection of the mediastinal lesions to remove the symptoms. Gross examination revealed that the resected masses were 10 enlarged Lymph nodes measuring 3–7 cm. Microscopic examination revealed cohesive sheets of diffuse large pleomorphic cells effacing the nodes architecture , characterized by abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei with abnormal mitotic figures and Reed–Sternberg-like cells . Thus, differential diagnosis included ALCL, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL), peripheral T-Cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|A chest radiography demonstrates an abnormal shadow in the mediastinum extending to the pulmonary hilar region.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT scan of the upper thoracic region demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes (Black Arrows) in the anterior mediastinum.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|H&E sections of resected lymph nodes demonstrating: (A and B) cohesive sheets of diffuse pleomorphic cells effacing the nodes architecture; (C and D) neoplastic cells characterized by abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei with multiple abnormal mitotic figures in addition to Reed–Sternberg like cells</u>\n\n【12】Immunohistochemical stainings showed strong CD30 positivity for large and Reed–Sternberg-like cells , whereas CD15, CD3, CD20, ALK, CD45Ro and EMA were negative .

Thus treatment regimen was based on alternating courses that included dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, vincristine, etoposide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide and prednisolone.\n\n【16】The last chest and abdomen CT scan on 18 March 2019 showed complete response and the patient is currently in remission on maintenance therapy of Vinblastine 10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】ALCL is an aggressive rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that’s characterized by pleomorphic cells labeled by Ki-1 antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It constitutes nearly 15% of pediatric NHL and 2% of all NHL. Furthermore, about 15–20% of ALCL cases affect patients under 20 years old mostly males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>, our rare case, however, was described in a 13-year-old female.\n\n【19】According to the revised fourth edition of the WHO classification 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u>, ALCL is defined as a CD30-positive neoplasm of T or null cell lineage, as these tumors are distinguished by their anaplastic cytology and constant membrane expression of CD30 antigen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are two subsets of ALCL: Primary cutaneous ALCL which is confined to the skin, and Systemic ALCL that affects all organs mostly the lymph nodes, with involvement of extra nodal sites including bone marrow, skin, soft tissues, lung and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The mediastinum is involved in ~10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and as it is a common site in CHL, we have faced more challenges adding CHL to differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】Furthermore, systemic ALCL is categorized into two main subtypes according to the expression of a protein called ALK: ALK-positive ALCL which constitutes 50–80% and is more common in young adults with a survival rate of 70–90% for 5 years, while ALK-negative ALCL represents 20–50% and tends to affect older adults with a worse prognosis and a survival rate of 40–60%. Male predominance (60%) is seen in both subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diagnosing ALCL can be challenging. Cytomorphologic findings, immunohistochemistry and clinical data were critical as there are certain similarities between ALCL, Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and DLBCL. These features include the proliferation of large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm and large atypical nuclei. And this gives an essential role for immunohistochemistry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Morphologically in ALCL, we see cohesive sheets of large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei surrounded by an inflammatory background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Neoplastic cells resemble Reed-Sternberg cells raising the difficulty in differentiating it from CHL.\n\n【24】However, CHL lacks cohesive growth pattern and has classical Reed–Sternberg cells with an inflammatory background and band-like fibrosis. Likewise, DLBCL can be distinguished with its large B-cells lineage, while PTCL-NOS is recognized with small clusters of epithelioid histiocytes resembling granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In addition, IHC stainings for ALK, CD30, CD3, CD15, CD20, CD45Ro and EMA are valuable in the differential diagnosis. In ALK–ALCL, cells show strong positivity for CD30, usually in Golgi region and at the cell membrane. Our case also showed negativity for CD15 excluding CHL. Without forgetting negativity for CD20 and EMA excluding DLBCL and negativity for CD3 and CD15 excluding PTCL-NOS.\n\n【26】Molecularly, detecting ALK protein correlates with a chromosomal translocation that involves NPM gene on chromosome 5q35 and ALK gene on chromosome 2p23. Furthermore, ALK+ALCL is characterized by overexpression of HIF1-a target genes as well as interleukin10 and H-ras/K-ras induced genes, while ALK–ALCL is enriched for TMOD1, TNFRSF8, GATA3, MYC, IRF4 target genes and PI3K pathway-regulated genes. Studies also revealed that DUSP22 and P63 rearrangement were present in 30% and 8% of ALK–ALCL cases respectively, but absent in ALK+ALCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, molecular testing has been largely replaced by immunohistochemistry. In addition, these tests were not available in our country, thus the diagnosis was based on immunohistochemical and cytomorphologic findings.\n\n【27】Furthermore, although studies showed correlation between the presence of ALK/Ki1 antigen and young ages, our case was ALK-negative presenting in a 13-year-old patient.\n\n【28】In conclusion, diagnosing ALK–ALCL represented a hard challenge due to rarity of presenting in young ages, male predominance and difficulties in diagnosis. However, with proper immunohistochemical stainings and detailed cytomorphologic observation, diagnosis was confirmed in our case.\n\n【29】Confict of Interest statement\n-----------------------------\n\n【30】Not applicable.\n\n【31】Consent\n-------\n\n【32】Consent Form was obtained from the patient’s guarantor (Patient’s father).

We report on a 67-year-old female patient, who was severely affected by post-herpetic NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. Her symptoms did not improve under methylprednisolone pulse therapy and plasma exchange under acyclovir prophylaxis. She received protein A immunoadsorption and a long-term immunosuppression with rituximab. Under treatment, activated T-cells as well as B- and plasma cells decreased in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and anti-NMDA-R IgG titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid declined with near complete cessation of intrathecal autoantibody synthesis. The patient regained near complete independence and profoundly improved on formal neuropsychological assessment. Despite reduction of antiviral defense through of lowered activated T cells and concomitantly decreasing HSV-specific IgG antibodies, no evidence of viral reactivation was detected.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In certain cases, relapsing symptoms following Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) encephalitis are caused by the formation of autoantibodies directed against the GluN1 subunit of the human NMDA-receptor (NMDA-R), linking autoimmune and infective pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.

Clinical examination on admission to our hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>( _T_ \\= 0 M, Fig. 1 )</u> showed the patient hallucinating and disorientated. She was aphasic and unable to verbally or non-verbally communicate. Muscle tone was increased with generalized rigidity, rendering the patient non-ambulatory.

The relapse 通用删除1(英):<u>( _T_ \\= 3 M, Fig. 1 )</u> was marked with an increase in anti-NMDA-R IgG titers to 1:1000 in CSF and a decrease to 1:320 in serum resulting in an ASI of 552.9 .\n\n【10】We established long-term immunotherapy with rituximab (2 × 200 mg for induction) under anti-infective prophylaxis (acyclovir 3 × 400 mg/d; co-trimoxazole 1 × 800/160 mg/d), because of the severity of the relapsing symptoms 通用删除1(英):<u>( _T_ \\= 3 M, Fig. 1 )</u>. The patient returned for follow-up and intravenous administration of 1 × 200 mg rituximab for maintenance therapy at 9 and 15 months after the initial presentation 通用删除1(英):<u>( _T_ \\= 9 and 15, Fig. 1 )</u>.

There were no adverse events under rituximab therapy.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Several studies have established that HSV1 encephalitis can trigger encephalitis with anti-NMDA-R autoantibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The infective form commonly antedates the autoimmune form, yet it remains uncertain which facet of HSV infection drives the autoimmune response. Testing for anti-NMDA-R antibodies in patients with relapses following HSV-encephalitis is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Overall the occurrence of such cases is rare, hence standardized treatment recommendations are not available yet. Treatment attempts regularly include antiviral and immunosuppressive agents, including combinations of acyclovir, steroids with and without PLEX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and secondary immunotherapy including rituximab or cyclophosphamide under acyclovir prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with post-herpetic NMDA-autoimmune encephalitis often suffer from residual deficits due to the HSV1 infection and experience new or worsening symptoms through NMDA-R–autoantibody formation. Immunosuppressive treatment can improve NMD-R autoantibody mediated symptoms hence it is recommended once the diagnosis is established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Patients with classic NMDA-R autoimmune encephalitis have been shown to recover to full health or minor residual deficits in up to 75% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>, it remains uncertain whether the prognosis of post-herpetic NMDA-R autoimmunencephalitis is as favorable. We describe an adult female patient suffering from severe relapsing post-herpetic anti-NMDA-R encephalitis, which failed to respond to MP and PLEX but improved remarkably under IA followed by induction of rituximab treatment at relapse. Both methods of therapeutic apheresis (PLEX and IA) have emerged as possible treatment options for autoimmune encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In our case, IA seemed to be more effective as improvement occurred with short latency following this therapy. This could be explained by the very effective removal of intrathecal autoantibodies by IA as reported recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, however, a cumulative effect of PLEX and IA cannot be fully ruled out as both methods were applied subsequently at both times in this patient. During maintenance treatment, activated T-cells as well as B- and plasma cells decreased in PB and CSF. Anti-NMDA-R IgG titers in PB and CSF declined with near complete cessation of intrathecal autoantibody synthesis. Despite reduction of activated T cells in PB and CSF and concomitant decreasing HSV IgG ASI, no evidence of viral reactivation was detected under treatment with rituximab. Cognitive and motor abilities increased, as demonstrated by NPA and improvement on modified Rankin scale, which declined from 5 to 2 within 12 months. Hence, rituximab in combination with IA, presents a possible treatment option for refractory post-herpetic NMDA-encephalitis as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, further research in an increased number of patients is needed regarding its efficacy and safety.\n\n【13】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【14】This study was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG)-funded Collaborative Research Centre TR128 ‘Initiating/Effector vs Regulatory Mechanisms in Multiple Sclerosis: Progress towards Tackling the Disease’ (Project Z2 to H.W.).\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She initially was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in September 2020 during an outbreak in her nursing home. On this occasion, she again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our case report describes the resident’s poor immune response indicated by a low IgG level after her initial COVID infection as well as reinfection with a ‘non-variant’ SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.177).\n\n【2】The case describes the importance of integration of community and secondary care.

The issues of low immune response to COVID-19 in older people and the emergence of variants of concern will continue to pose a threat to this susceptible group.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】We present a case referred to our novel community frailty response service. The community frailty response service is composed of an emergency medicine or medicine for older person’s physician and occupational therapist. Between them, they have the ability to carry out medical, functional and cognitive assessments and perform near patient blood testing, portable electrocardiogram, point-of-care ultrasound and administer intravenous medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The service encompasses a catchment area of almost 320 000 people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【6】A nursing home resident, who had a 1-day history of shortness of breath and pyrexia, was referred to the community frailty response service in November 2020. She was also considered by the nursing home staff to be more confused than usual. She had previously tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the 9 September 2021 during an outbreak in the same nursing home, and the virus was confirmed on polymerase chain reaction with a cycle threshold (CT) value of 19.7 on the IDEXX OptiSARS assay.\n\n【7】Initial assessment by the response service noted the resident to be short of breath on exertion and to have a dry cough. Eliciting a detailed history from the resident was limited by her cognition but she denied any other symptoms of focal infection. On examination, her vitals were stable, and she maintained a SpO2 of 96% or higher. There was an audible wheeze throughout both lungs on auscultation. Further examination revealed that the patient had developed delirium. Combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a CT value of 17.9 on the Roche Cobas platform on 25 November 2021. This was 11 weeks after her previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was negative on 30 November 2021 with a value of 0.06 (reference range for negative results < 1.4).\n\n【8】She was treated in the nursing home setting and prescribed medications for symptomatic control only (i.e. paracetamol). An advance care plan was put in place, which prioritized comfort measures. The community frailty response service reviewed her regularly and was available to provide supplemental oxygen, medications and palliative treatment if necessary. Fortunately, her condition began to improve on Day 5 after the onset of her symptoms.\n\n【9】Subsequent whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by the B.1.177 lineage. The first swab sample was not typable; however, variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7 (the alpha variant), had not been detected in surveillance samples in September in Ireland, and we can therefore deduce that the resident had become infected on two occasions with the B.1.177 lineage. A repeat IgG was positive with a value of 9.4 on 22 December 2021, demonstrating some level of immunogenicity after her second infection. The patient was vaccinated with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 19 January 2021 and 15 February 2021 in her nursing home. There have been no further outbreaks after this point.\n\n【10】Of the 51 residents in the nursing home, 39 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during this second outbreak. Four residents were transferred to the acute hospital as their condition deteriorated. Four residents died throughout the course of the outbreak. The remaining residents remained either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms during their clinical course. A number of residents were independently mobile, which posed a threat of further viral transmission due to the presence of increased activity and the presence of exit-seeking behaviours. This risk was mitigated by isolation in single rooms, patient supervision and adherence to infection protection and control guidelines.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, 87% of deaths were in people 65 years and older, though only 13% of infections were in this age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Ireland, at all stages of the national COVID-19 restrictions, older people were required to avoid public transport, to only shop during designated hours and to avoid leaving the house unless necessary in order to limit unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A 10% decrease in Emergency Department (ED) attendances by older patients was noted in the acute hospital at this time as patients declined transfer from their homes to attend hospital care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As a result, the existing community frailty response service was expanded to operate 7 days a week to provide emergency assessment and treatment in the patient’s home and when appropriate facilitated access to secondary care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】This case highlights the additional complexities involved in caring for frail patients with COVID-19 and the importance of the multidisciplinary approach to care. Close clinical monitoring and nurse supervision allowed for the early detection of potential deterioration of the patients and helped reduce viral transmission by limiting exit-seeking behaviour. Input from the public health and COVID response team incorporating registered advanced nurse practitioner and Consultant Geriatrician support provided expert advice on a range of clinical matters and infection prevention and control measures. The integration of services is in line with and emphasizes the advantages of the Irish health service’s objective of integration of primary, community and hospital care around the needs and choices of the patients while supporting them to remain in their communities (as detailed in the Slaintecare report) and adheres to COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Examination of Measures to 2021 Report to the Minister for Health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Current data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is rare within 5–8 months. Data on healthcare workers (HCWs) demonstrate an 83% reduction in risk, with median protective effect observed 5 months following primary infection. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> Data in HCWs demonstrate that anti-Spike IgG remains elevated for 6 months post-infection. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> Although IgG levels may be present for months and may be correlated with neutralizing antibody activity, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> the data are not, however, conclusive that antibody positivity protects from reinfection. A significant limiting factor in these studies is the focus on HCWs, who are overwhelmingly under 65 years of age. There are concerns that older persons may not retain immunity to COVID-19 after disease or vaccination given immunosenescence (via proliferative exhaustion and naïve T-cell depletion among many causes) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>; however, data are lacking due to the short-term immunogenicity studies to date. Furthermore, novel variants of concern raise the issues of likely decreased immunity, as SARS-CoV-2 may not confer cross-immunity to other viral lineages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge, worldwide, and in our own country the committed, compassionate and dedicated care that healthcare workers across the community and hospital settings have continued to provide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cervical punch biopsies taken showed a benign cervical perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa), with MRI imaging and PET-CT scan indicating a 3–4 cm endocervical tumour with malignant features. The patient underwent radical hysterectomy with lymph node dissection and the surgical specimen histopathology demonstrated a residual benign PEComa and a stage IIB mesonephric adenocarcinoma (MNA) of the cervix.

Cervical PEComas are extremely rare tumours of mesenchymal origin deriving from the perivascular epithelioid cells with only 14 cases described so far. Cervical MNAs are rare tumours originating from the remnants of the mesonephric duct of Wolff with only 40 cases reported. Our case adds to the existing literature and highlights the challenges with regard to preoperative diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The existence of a perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) with a mesonephric adenocarcinoma (MNA) of the cervix is extremely exceptional. The first case of cervical PEComa was reported in 2004 and to the best of our knowledge there are only 15 cases of this tumour described in the published literature including the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 6 \\]</u>. A recent literature review has reported that since 1962 there have been only 40 cases of MNA of the cervix described to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We report the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and treatment of such a unique co-existence.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 67-year-old woman was referred from primary care to gynaecology outpatients’ due to post-menopausal bleeding and a clinically suspicious cervix. The patient reported no history of post-coital bleeding or abdominal pain and had a normal smear history. She had two normal vaginal deliveries and had received hormone-replacement therapy following her menopause for a brief time period. There was no significant past medical or family history.\n\n【6】On clinical examination, a 2 cm friable mass that bled on contact was found protruding through the uterine cervix. Cervical punch biopsies and an endometrial sampling biopsy were taken. Imaging investigations of the uterine cervix were arranged and the case was referred to the local tumour board for further management.\n\n【7】The cervical punch biopsies showed flat sheets of an epithelioid tumour with minimal pleomorphism, cytoplasmic pigmentation and a low mitotic index (<1/50 high power fields). Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumour was strongly positive for HMB-45, weakly positive for Melan-A, and negative for S100. The differential diagnosis of the cervical punch biopsies based on the cytological and immunohistochemical characteristics was between primary or secondary cervical melanoma and cervical PEComa. However, the low degree of pleomorphism and the low mitotic count favoured PEComa over melanoma . The endometrial tissue specimen was negative for any endometrial pathology.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|The cervical punch biopsies showed flat sheets of an epithelioid tumour with minimal pleomorphism, cytoplasmic pigmentation, scattered mitoses ( **A** and **B** : hematoxylin–eosin staining, 10×, 40×).

The MRI imaging of the pelvis showed a 3 cm endocervical mass with an intermediate signal intensity. PET-CT scan imaging of the pelvis demonstrated a 4.5 × 2.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> soft tissue mass located at the centre of the uterine cervix with a marked uptake (max SUV 14.8) indicative of a malignant tumour. The mass was in close proximity to the posterior wall of the bladder but there was no definite direct invasion. No evidence of metastatic disease or abnormal lymph nodes was shown .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Imaging tests of the uterine cervix.

Histopathology showed a residual benign PEComa and a moderately differentiated MNA. The MNA was composed of small glands with mild nuclear pleomorphism, scanty mitoses and no cytoplasmic vacuolation. Many of the glands contained dense eosinophilic luminal material. The MNA of the cervix was 4 cm in size, and was extending into the isthmic region and the myometrium of the uterine corpus. The vaginal resection margins and the paracervical fat were also involved (R1 resection). The 17 lymph nodes in total from the pelvis were identified and they were all free of the malignant tumour.\n\n【12】The patient was finally diagnosed with a tumour of the uterine cervix comprising a completely excised residual benign PEComa and a moderately differentiated MNA of the cervix FIGO stage IIB with positive excision margins and positive parametrial involvement. After radical surgery, the patient received chemo-radiotherapy and brachytherapy treatment. There is no disease recurrence 12 months after the surgery. The patient is being monitored closely.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Cervical PEComa is an extremely rare tumour of mesenchymal origin deriving from the perivascular epithelioid cells. The mean age of women presenting with cervical PEComas in the literature is 41 years (range: 24–67) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 6 \\]</u>. This is much younger than the mean age of those with uterine PEComas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> which has been reported to be 51 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patients usually present with a pelvic mass or abnormal vaginal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Two of the cases of cervical PEComas were related to tuberous sclerosis complex, which is a genetic disorder characterized by mental retardation, seizures and the presence of tumours such as cutaneous angiofibromas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Because clinical presentation is non-specific and imaging tests such as ultrasound, MRI and PET-CT scanning are totally inconclusive as to the nature of the tumour, a tissue specimen with immunohistochemistry is needed to establish the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】MNA is a rare tumour that derives from the remnants of the mesonephric duct of Wolff in the lateral regions of the cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the recent literature review of 40 cases of MNA of the cervix described so far, the mean age of women was 52 years (range: 24–73) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most women present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and/or with a cervical mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The patient’s cervical screening cytology tests are usually negative and diagnosis is established by the histopathological examination of tissue specimens taken from the cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. MNA of the cervix is one of the few histological types of cervical cancer that is not related to the human papilloma virus (HPV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】According to the 2014 World Health Organization classification of tumours of the female reproductive organs, PEComas are tumours of mesenchymal origin with distinct morphological and immunohistochemical features that aid their diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. They typically contain epithelioid cells with clear to eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm demonstrating melanocytic and smooth muscle differentiation, thought to be derived from the so-called perivascular epithelioid cell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. PEComas frequently express the markers of HMB-45 (92%) and Melan-A (72%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In addition, up to 80% stain positive for smooth muscle actin, whereas desmin and h-caldesmon expression is less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In one case report, a subset of PEComas was identified with positive staining for TFE3 and a molecularly confirmed TFE3 gene rearrangement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Cervical PEComas are rare and their biological behaviour is unknown. For this reason, there are two classification systems described in the literature in the attempt to classify them as ‘benign’, ‘malignant’ or of ‘uncertain malignancy potential’ and to allow for prognostication. The first classification was developed by Folpe _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and the proposed criteria for malignancy were: tumour size >5 cm, mitotic count >1/50 HPF, necrosis, high nuclear grade and infiltrating growth pattern. The second classification was suggested by Schoolmeester _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and involved the following criteria: size ≥5 cm, mitotic index ≥1/50 HPF, significant nuclear atypia, necrosis and lymphovascular invasion. If no criteria are met then the cervical PEComa is classified as benign. If the tumour has 1–3 of the criteria, then it is considered of uncertain malignancy potential, and if there are 4 or more criteria then it is malignant. The PEComa tumour in our case was benign according to the criteria described above.\n\n【18】Treatment for cervical PEComas usually involves hysterectomy, with only two cases being reported of local excision only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Due to the rarity of the disease, it cannot be confirmed whether a cervical PEComa has a better prognosis when compared to a uterine corpus PEComa. In the cases of cervical PEComa described so far, only one woman who received local excision had disease recurrence (8.3%), whereas in a case series of 42 uterine corpus PEComas there were nine women with disease recurrence (21.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Cervical MNAs present with a mixture of morphological and immunohistochemical features that assist in the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. They usually present with florid mesonephric hyperplasia and with a densely eosinophilic luminal secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It has been reported that there is no lobular architecture, the nuclei have malignant features and the Ki-67 proliferation index is 15–20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cervical MNAs have positive immunostaining for CD10, CK7, calretinin, EMA, vimentin, PAX8 and CA125, but negative immunostaining for CEA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Due to the rarity of cervical MNA the biological behaviour and prognosis of these tumours is not known. It has been reported that MNA carries a worse prognosis than the other histological types. It has been described that women with stage I MNA had a recurrence rate of 32% as compared to a recurrence rate of 16 and 11% for adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix in early stage cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Treatment for cervical MNA depends on the stage of the cervical malignancy and involves radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and the final histopathology of the surgical specimen demonstrated residual benign PEComa and a stage IIB MNA of the cervix. The patient is being followed up by the gynaecologic oncology team and there is no disease recurrence 12 months after the surgery.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we report the first case of a tumour of the cervix with the component of a benign cervical PEComa and that of a stage IIB MNA. This case adds to the current body of literature and highlights the challenges that are imposed on the management in terms of preoperative diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding for this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dimitrios Papoutsis is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The bronchoscopic removal of sharp metallic foreign bodies is technically challenging for the operating surgeon.

X-ray of soft tissue neck showed a radio-opaque foreign body being lodged in the supraglottic area. She underwent emergency direct laryngoscopy-guided foreign body removal under general anesthesia. There was an open metallic sharp safety pin hinged over the inter-arytenoid region with its one end reaching sub-glottis and other end toward the hypopharynx. No post-operative complications occurred and patient was discharged on the third post-operative day.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A foreign body aspirated in the airway is a life-threatening condition, having a variable medical history, symptoms, peri-operative morbidities and prognosis. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> Although foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial tree are most frequent in children aged 1–3 years, they can occur at any age. Commonly aspirated foreign bodies include food, beads and metallic objects. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> Sometimes, unusual foreign bodies may get aspirated like broken tracheostomy tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, hypodermic needles, metallic nail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and scarf pins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The clinical symptomatology may begin as soon as the foreign body is aspirated, which includes coughing, choking, stridor, excessive sputum production, cyanosis or shortness of breathing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is not uncommon for patients to remain asymptomatic, who are at increased risk of developing dreadful complications, including death, due to delayed intervention. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice in management of pediatric airway foreign bodies. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> The airway is shared by the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, and hence, an excellent coordination between the two is of paramount importance. As the airway in children is of very small caliber, it warrants some degree of skill and composure to negotiate rigid bronchoscope and proceed with the manipulation and removal of foreign body. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> Utmost care is to be depicted when the surgeon is dealing with a sharp metallic foreign body in the airway as its removal can be tedious with significant post-operative complications. Herein, we present a case of a female child with sharp metallic foreign body in the airway who underwent an uncomplicated direct laryngoscopy-guided foreign body removal within hours of aspiration.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 8-year-old female child from a remote village in the eastern Nepal presented to pediatric emergency unit of our institute with alleged history of aspiration of safety pin 8 hours back. She accidentally aspirated the safety pin while she kept the pin in between her lips when she was getting dressed. Immediately following aspiration, she developed a cough and one episode of blood-mixed vomiting. She also developed pain on swallowing but there was no cyanosis, stridor, shortness of breath and excessive sputum production. Her mother rushed her to a regional tertiary center where she was assessed and an X-ray soft tissue neck was ordered, which showed a radio-opaque foreign body in the upper airway. She was then referred to our center.\n\n【7】On clinical examination, the child was comfortable with no cyanosis, labored breathing or stridor. On examination of neck, anterior neck tenderness could be elicited at the level of cricoid cartilage. On auscultation of chest, there was bilateral normal vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds. Her vitals, including oxygen saturation, were within normal limits . We repeated her X-ray soft tissue neck which showed a radio-opaque foreign body (open safety pin) with its blunt end superiorly and its two open ends directed inferiorly .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Clinical condition of an 8-year-old girl at the time of presentation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|X-ray soft tissue neck: anteroposterior and lateral view showing the foreign body (open safety pin).</u>\n\n【10】After detailed preoperative evaluation, emergency rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal under general anesthesia was planned. Careful planning and anticipation of untoward events were discussed by the ear, nose, throat consultant and anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist proceeded with induction of anesthesia followed by jet ventilation. Direct laryngoscopy using optical laryngoscope was performed initially. The foreign body was visualized and it was an open, sharp metallic safety pin that was hinged over the inter-arytenoid region with its blunt end and its other two ends lying at hypopharynx and sub-glottis. Under direct laryngoscopy guidance, foreign body removal forceps was inserted and the foreign body was removed . Following its removal, check bronchoscopy was done that revealed mild sub-glottic edema and minimal laceration in hypopharynx at the site of impingement of foreign body’s sharp end. No intraoperative complication was noted and the child was shifted to the ward after 4 hours of observation in the post-operative recovery room. A post-operative X-ray soft tissue neck was obtained, which was normal .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Foreign body (safety pin) removed in toto.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Post-operative X-ray soft tissue neck anteroposterior and lateral view showing no residual foreign body.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Accidental inhalation of sharp metallic foreign bodies in children can present with variable symptomatology or no symptoms at all 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 6 , 10 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with throat pain, dysphagia and anterior neck tenderness owing to the unusual lodgment of open metallic safety pin with its open sharp end toward the sub-glottis and hypopharynx. She had no alarming symptoms due to minimal obstruction of the airway by the foreign body itself and insignificant airway edema.\n\n【15】Although positive predictive accuracy of clinical diagnosis is 74.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, X-ray soft tissue neck is a valuable tool to diagnose radio-opaque airway foreign body like metallic safety pins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, clinico-radiological diagnosis was made in our patient. Rigid bronchoscopy is a widely used modality of removal of airway foreign bodies in children owing to its safety, excellent visualization and provision for continuous ventilation of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We also planned for rigid bronchoscopy in our patient, but the passage of rigid bronchoscope was restricted by the size of the airway of the patient and unusual location of the foreign body. Hence, an optical direct laryngoscopy was used to visualize the foreign body, and its removal was done by grasping with forceps. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed to check for any remaining part of the foreign body and injuries caused by the lodgment of foreign body. Hence, it is imperative to have a detailed discussion of procedural plan between the surgeon and anesthesiologist for a satisfactory outcome of the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had an uneventful post-operative outcome, which highlights the importance of early presentation and prompt surgical intervention in the management of airway foreign bodies in children.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like thank the Department of ENT Head and Neck Surgery and the Department of Anesthesiology for helping to publish this article.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding for this report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval is waived for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained from the patient’s legal guardian (mother).</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Milan Sedhai MBBS (corresponding author).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The point is to understand’.\n\n【1】Albert Einstein.\n\n【2】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sneakily entered our lives early on in 2020 and the adverse health effects associated with it continue. We now understand more about the virus and about how to manage patients. Large-scale studies have been initiated across the globe and one provided an ally in our fight against COVID-19 in an old fashioned drug, dexamethasone reducing mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Others showed reduction in hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> or simply reinforced the safety of continuing medications during COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We have also realized how catastrophic the virus can be. We learned that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which causes COVID-19, enters the cells using Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. These receptors are found abundantly not only in the pulmonary but also other organ systems such as the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Consequently, extra-pulmonary effects of COVID-19 are not at all surprising. With an increasing number of cases and a forthcoming second wave infection, clinicians must be aware of these multisystem manifestations. In this article, we aim to discuss the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the respiratory and some of the other major organ systems in the human body.\n\n【3】RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\n------------------\n\n【4】The principal manifestation of COVID-19 is in the lungs, where respiratory failure is a leading cause of death. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to the ACE2 receptors, that are highly expressed in the alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), explaining the vulnerability of the respiratory system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_Post mortem_ studies elucidate the observed pathology upon macroscopic and microscopic examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Gross lung findings include patchy to diffuse consolidation, severe interstitial congestion, and thromboembolism while histology demonstrates hyaline membranes, extensive capillary congestion, and microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, consistent with exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) . Whilst aforementioned findings resemble those found in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19-associated ARDS displays a peculiar phenotype owing to dissociation between severity of hypoxaemia and relative maintenance of lung mechanics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|_Post mortem_ examination of COVID-19 patients reveals diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction; microscopic lung findings: ( **A** ) Exudative DAD showing discrete hyaline membranes and prominent capillary congestion; ( **B** ) syncytial cells of pneumocyte II origin; ( **C** ) Extensive capillary congestion without DAD; ( **D** ) Microthrombi in alveolar capillaries; image reproduced from Menter _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> under the terms of the creative commons attribution license</u>\n\n【7】Despite COVID-19-associated ARDS meeting the criteria, it has been proposed that patients developing it could be categorized into type 1 ‘non-ARDS’ and type 2 ‘ARDS’ depending on lung compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Distinction between them can be made based on computed tomography (CT) scans  or, albeit substandard, response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Type 1 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with reasonable lung compliance while type 2 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with poor lung compliance.

Myocardial injury, in turn, has been shown to be independently associated with high mortality and various complications such as ARDS and electrolyte disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, increasing the risk of arrhythmias.

Rashes appeared either before (9%) or after (11%) hospitalization and were described as erythematous, widespread urticarial or resembling chickenpox.

In this study, patients received a variety of drug treatments and not all skin manifestations may therefore be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2.

A systematic review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> of 41 studies found the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 could be divided into three main categories: (i) neurological diseases comorbid with COVID-19, i.e. symptoms prior to the infection and neurological diseases that also act as a risk factor for developing the virus, (ii) non-specific neurological manifestations caused by systemic responses and partly the neuro-invasive behaviour of the virus and (iii) specific neurological symptoms and diseases including encephalitis, myelitis and seizures.\n\n【26】One national registry of 125 COVID-19 patients investigating neurological or psychiatric disease over a three-week period found 31% to have altered mental status including 16 (13%) with encephalopathy  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> and 23 (18%) with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Of the 23 patients, ten had psychosis; six neuro-cognitive dementia-like syndrome and four demonstrated an affective disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.

However, the extremely high number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 and the large percentage of those with stroke having other risk factors makes proving causality a challenge.

Morbidity and mortality most commonly occur secondary to pump failure or ventricular arrhythmias; however, a more infrequently seen complication is the formation of mural thrombi. More commonly seen within the left ventricle, thrombi can embolize leading to stroke or end organ infarction. We present the case of a male who presented with decompensated heart failure. The presence of biventricular thrombi was found on echocardiography and subsequent cross-sectional imaging revealed these had embolized resulting in the rare complication of extensive abdominal aortic thrombosis with renal and testicular infarction. Biventricular thrombi are rare but high risk due to the potential for embolization as demonstrated in this case. Prompt recognition and management with anti-coagulation are essential, followed by treatment of the underlying pathology, which resulted in the formation of thrombi to prevent recurrence.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heart failure is an epidemic resulting in significant health care expenditure and morbidity for patients. Mural thrombus is a rare complication most commonly seen in the left ventricle (LV) following anterior myocardial infarction. Biventricular thrombi have been infrequently described; we present a case of biventricular thrombi resulting in extensive embolization and end organ infarction.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male smoker presented with exertional dyspnoea and scrotal swelling, without testicular pain, on a background of hypertension and excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was consistent with decompensated heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure, anasarca, peripheral and scrotal oedema.\n\n【6】Initial blood tests revealed an N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level of 27 594 pg/ml (<400 pg/ml) with deranged liver and renal biochemistry including an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 2266 u/l (<50 u/l) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 35 ml/min (>90 ml/min).

The inferior mesenteric artery was also occluded at its origin although there was distal opacification and normal mucosal enhancement of the colon was preserved. In addition, there was reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally with occlusion of the testicular arteries .\n\n【11】Given the history of excessive alcohol consumption, this was presumed to be the most likely aetiology of the patient’s heart failure which subsequently resulted in the formation of biventricular thrombi leading to embolic extensive aortic thrombosis. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was deemed unlikely given the absence of anginal symptoms or ischaemic electrocardiogram changes. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy would be an alternative differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation. An underlying thrombophilia such as anti-phospholipid syndrome accounting for the multiple sites of arterial thrombosis was considered; however, a thrombophilia screen was negative.\n\n【12】A multifaceted management approach to this patient initially included treatment of heart failure with intravenous furosemide infusion and commencement of ramipril. His heart failure medications were further optimized with the addition of eplerenone and ivabradine with good symptomatic benefit. The patient was strongly encouraged to cease further alcohol consumption.\n\n【13】With regards to the extensive aortic thrombosis, a surgical approach was deemed prohibitively high risk given the patient’s poor cardiac function. A percutaneous thrombectomy via the femoral approach was attempted but was unsuccessful, and therefore the patient was managed conservatively with a heparin infusion and subsequently converted to warfarin.\n\n【14】Serum testosterone levels were found to be low at 1.3 nmol/L (7–26 nmol/L) due to testicular infarction, and therefore replacement was commenced. Following improvement in symptoms and renal and liver biochemistry, the patient was discharged on oral diuretics and long-term warfarin therapy with an INR target of 2–3 in keeping with guideline recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Follow-up.\n\nThe patient developed sepsis |$\\\\sim$| 2 months following the initial presentation, from the right femoral access site which was persistently discharging following the previous attempt at femoral thrombectomy. A post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis study was performed to exclude other potential sources of sepsis, confirmed a right groin collection. There was persistent extensive aortic occlusive thrombus as seen previously; however, there was evidence of new collateralization from rectus abdominis and paraspinal arteries filling the external iliac and femoral arteries. The biventricular thrombi had resolved and there was no evidence of propagation of the aortic thrombus or new arterial thrombosis.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】The formation of LV thrombus in the context of cardiomyopathy with LV impairment and reduced ejection fraction is well-documented; however, biventricular thrombosis is a rarer occurrence complicating up to 23.9% of LV thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Biventricular thrombi have been previously reported in the literature complicating acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. The proposed mechanism for ventricular thrombus formation in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy, as in this case, is blood stasis secondary to cavity dilatation and hypokinesis. A hypercoagulable state can also predispose to the formation of biventricular thrombi including conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. A thrombophilia screen should therefore be performed as part of the investigation for biventricular thrombi.\n\n【19】Complications of biventricular thrombi include systemic and pulmonary embolization which can result in significant end-organ damage such as pulmonary emboli, stroke, acute limb ischaemia and visceral ischaemia. Contemporary data suggest an annualized embolism rate of 3.7% despite treatment with anti-coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Ventricular thrombi complicated by such extensive aortic thrombus have not previously been reported in the literature to our knowledge. There was evidence of end-organ damage with left renal infarct and bilateral testicular infarcts. No pulmonary emboli were demonstrated in this case.\n\n【20】A high index of suspicion is required when predisposing factors for the formation of ventricular thrombi exist such as apical hypokinesia particularly following a large anterior myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial investigation of choice and has 35–60% sensitivity and 90% specificity for LV thrombus detection. Although CT has similar detection rates to TTE, delayed enhancement cardiac MRI is the gold standard for LV thrombus detection with 88% sensitivity and 99% specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】There are no guideline recommendations for the treatment of biventricular thrombus. In practice, patients are treated with low molecular weight heparin before being established on oral anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only approved oral anticoagulant for LV thrombus; however, emerging evidence suggests direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in selected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for up to 6 months for treatment of LV thrombus, with duration guided by surveillance TTE and consideration of bleeding risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thrombolysis remains a treatment option, however carries a risk of catastrophic embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thrombectomy should be considered in patients with a larger, more mobile thrombi which carry an increased risk of embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conservative management in the present case with warfarin resulted in the resolution of ventricular thrombi; however, due to persisting aortic thrombus, the decision was made to continue long-term anti-coagulation.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding associated with this case report.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required for this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Saad Ezad.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with total-colitis-type ulcerative colitis at the age of 15 years. He was then diagnosed with steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis. He was given golimumab, which resulted in remission. Ten months after beginning golimumab, he was urgently hospitalised with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Hence, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy was performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Pathologically, abundant infiltration of eosinophils was observed in the edematous intralobular stroma of the pancreas. He was diagnosed with EP, and treated with corticosteroids.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The various complications of ulcerative colitis include arthritis and skin symptoms, and, in rare cases, can include eosinophilic disorders. Previous studies have reported eosinophilic esophagitis and myocarditis as complications of ulcerative colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Eosinophilic pancreatitis (EP) is extremely rare among eosinophilic diseases, save for one report as a complication of ulcerative colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. EP is characterised by infiltration of eosinophils into the pancreatic parenchyma. It is often difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer and is generally diagnosed after surgery. We report a very rare case of EP that was diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) in a patient with ulcerative colitis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with moderate pan-ulcerative colitis at the age of 15 years. Treatment with mesalazine 3600 mg resulted in remission; however, he was referred to our hospital following a gradual worsening of both his symptoms and endoscopic findings. At the first visit, he described tenderness in the lower abdomen and reported 10 episodes of bloody diarrhea daily. Laboratory investigations showed an increased white blood cell count of 11 400 mm <sup>3 </sup> , C-reactive protein level of 10.77 mg/dl, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. Colonoscopy revealed pan-colonic inflammation with an endoscopic Mayo score of 2.\n\n【6】His symptoms improved with prednisolone 30-mg and mesalazine 4800-mg treatment. Steroids were gradually tapered over 2 months; however, he experienced symptom recurrence and eventually became steroid-dependent. No azathioprine/mercaptopurine was used for this condition. Thirteen weeks after the first visit, the patient was given golimumab 200 mg as an initial induction dose, which resulted in remission. Ten months after beginning golimumab, he had a fever of 39.8°C and severe epigastric pain. Laboratory examination revealed elevated pancreatic enzymes (p-amylase 1324 U/L, lipase 1318 U/L), increased white blood cell count of 14,400 mm <sup>3 </sup> with 25.4% eosinophils and normal IgE (166 IU), and a C-reactive protein level of 11.32 mg/dl. His ulcerative colitis condition was in remission. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse swelling of the pancreas . He was urgently hospitalised, confirming the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. He had no history of alcohol use, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia and gallstone disease. As IgG4 and antinuclear antibody were normal, type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging was contraindicated due to a tattoo. Hence, EUS-FNB using a 22-gage FNA needle (EZ Shot 3 Plus; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was performed with three punctures to obtain a definitive diagnosis. There were no abnormal findings in the gastric mucosa. EUS revealed generalised swelling of the pancreas and coarse parenchymal texture. The main pancreatic duct was not dilated . Pathologically, abundant infiltration of eosinophils was observed in the edematous intralobular stroma of the pancreas. Plasma cells were inconspicuous, IgG-positive cells were scarce and IgG4-positive cells were not found . No neutrophil infiltration or granulocyte epithelial lesions peculiar to type 2 AIP were observed. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with EP. He was treated with 30 mg of corticosteroids, which improved his symptoms and the CT findings . His corticosteroid dose was gradually reduced. He continued with golimumab treatment, with no recurrence of EP or ulcerative colitis for 2 years.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Abdominal CT obtained at admission shows diffuse swelling of the pancreas (arrow).

Furthermore, to our knowledge, there has only been one other case describing EP in the setting of ulcerative colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In EP, eosinophils infiltrate the pancreatic tissue, which, in many cases, increases eosinophils in peripheral blood. In the present case, eosinophils were 25.4% of white blood cells. The involvement of eosinophilic gastroenteritis and allergic diseases have been suggested as potential causes of EP, although these findings were not observed in our case. In addition, similar to IgG in AIP, IgE is important for the development of EP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, the IgE level was normal in our patient. A pancreatic cancer-like mass forms in many cases of EP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and the diagnosis is generally confirmed by pathological examination after surgery. In the present case, there was diffuse swelling of the pancreas similar to AIP and no tumor formation was observed. There are rare reports of EP that exhibit diffuse swelling as well as mass formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. To avoid excessive invasiveness, EUS-FNB should be actively considered for diagnosis.\n\n【12】There are several previous reports of elevated eosinophils in peripheral blood inpatients using anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) agents. The present patient was also receiving golimumab, which is an anti-TNF-α agent, and developed EP about 10 months after commencing golimumab therapy. However, as our patient improved without stopping golimumab, the role of the anti-TNF-α agent in the development of EP is unclear. In this case, continued anti-TNF-α agent had no effect on the pancreas. Anti-TNF-α agent and EP do not seem to be related. In addition, no study has reported the involvement of anti-TNF-α agent in the development of EP. Interestingly, there is one reported case of drug-induced pancreatitis with eosinophilia in a patient treated with vedolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In summary, we report a rare case of EP complicated with ulcerative colitis. As a large-scale research on this condition is difficult, it is very important to continue to accumulate reports of such cases.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to extend our thanks to Ms Noriko Arai for secretarial support.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients provided written, informed consent for the publication of this report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Yasumi Katayama MD, PhD.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRIOR PRESENTATION\n------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Asymptomatic cases may develop into symptomatic pulmonary hydatidosis due to the rupture of hydatid cysts. _Lophomonas,_ as causative agents of pulmonary lophomoniasis, is an emerging protozoan that mostly infects the lower respiratory airways. Clinical symptoms of these two diseases can mostly be overlapped. Herein, we describe the rare case of comorbidity of a ruptured cystic echinococcosis and lophomoniasis in a 38-year-old male farmer with a history of opium addiction from northern Iran.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hydatidosis is a parasitic and zoonotic infection caused by the larval stage of _Echinococcus granulosus_ ( _Taeniidae_ family). Most reports of hydatidosis in humans have been due to infection with _E. granulosus_ (cystic echinococcosis) and _Echinococcus multilocularis_ (alveolar echinococcosis). _E. granulosus_ is very common in countries where agriculture and animal husbandry are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–2 \\]</u>. Humans can accidentally become intermediate hosts by ingesting tape worm eggs. Cysts of this parasite involve almost all the tissues of the human body, especially the liver, lungs, spleen and kidneys. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, about one million people worldwide are infected with cystic echinococcosis (CE) each year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is expected to be more prevalent in rural areas of developing countries where the main occupation is animal husbandry and farmer. Iran (mostly western areas) is a hyperendemic region for CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Imaging findings such as complemented by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are generally very useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Also, different serological tests can support the diagnosis of CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since most cases of CE are asymptomatic, uncomplicated cysts on chest radiography are usually seen as round lesions, but complications such as infection and perforation may alter the radiographic appearance of the CE and make it difficult to diagnose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Asymptomatic cases may develop into symptomatic pulmonary hydatidosis due to the rupture of hydatid cysts. Cyst rupture can occur spontaneously or as a consequence of trauma, and in some cases, a severe cough can rupture the pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It has previously been reported that co-infection of human CE with bacterial, viral and fungal infections has occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_Lophomonas_ is a flagellated extracellular and emerging protozoan that infects the lower (mostly) and upper respiratory tract. This protozoan is found commensally in the lower intestines of cockroaches and termites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The main symptoms of a _Lophomonas_ infection include cough, sputum and shortness of breath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. So far, several cases of co-infection with lophomoniasis and other infectious diseases in the world have been reported. But there is no evidence of lophomoniasis and CE co-infection in the world. Herein, we describe the first case of concomitant infection of a ruptured CE and lophomoniasis from northern Iran.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 38-year-old male farmer with a history of opium addiction was referred to an emergency ward in northern Iran with symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, cough with massive sputum, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, weakness and lethargy. The patient was immunocompetent with any history of underlying disease. He had a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg, a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, a temperature of 37.8°C and an oxygen saturation (SO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 94% on examination. On chest examination, decreased breath sounds were noted on the left hemithorax, but there was no organomegaly in the abdomen. The results of his laboratory findings are shown in Table 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|An axial chest CT scan shows a thick-walled cystic lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung.

An axial chest CT scan revealed a thick-walled cystic lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung. It contains internal membranes in its dependent portion with associated bilateral patchy ground glass opacities, suggestive of a ruptured hydatid cyst.\n\n【19】Unfortunately, the patient suffered from severe coughs in the ward, and as a result, his general condition worsened. Due to severe cough, the patient was sedated with midozolam and underwent emergency fiber optic bronchoscopy, and a broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed. Then, two BALF samples were submitted to the hospital laboratory to rule out (R/O) BK (Bacillus of Koch) and fungal infections. A BALF specimen was also submitted to the Iranian National Registry Center for Lophomoniasis, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, to rule out _Lophomonas_ infection. Furthermore, a serological test for CE was requested to rule out CE. Finally, the result of the lab tests was as follows:\n\n【20】Fungal infection and tuberculosis were ruled out in the BALF samples. Besides, on microscopic examination of the BALF specimen under a light microscope, a number of live and oval-flagellated _Lophomonas_ protozoa were observed. Also, hydatid cyst protoscoleces (the larval forms of the parasites) were accidentally observed during microscopic examination. Furthermore, anti- _Echinococcus_ antibodies were detected in the patient’s serum.\n\n【21】Finally, the patient was treated with metronidazole (15 mg/kg; IV; for 2 weeks) to treat the _Lophomonas_ infection. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good general condition and with oral medication prescriptions after receiving albendazole tablets in several 1-month oral doses (10–15 mg/kg/d) separated by 14-day intervals for 6 months. One month after starting medical therapy, the patient underwent a minimally invasive thoracoscopic procedure to remove the cyst. A CT scan 6 months after receiving the treatment was requested to follow up on the response to the treatment. After that, the cystic lesion was resolved and the patient had no symptoms thereafter (data not shown). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. Also, CARE guidelines and methodology were followed in this study. The report was approved by ethical committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (IR.MAZUMS.IMAMHOSPITAL.REC.1398.002).\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】Hydatidosis usually involves the two main organs of the body: the lungs and liver. The lung is the second most common organ after the liver in hydatidosis. Cysts grow easily in elastic tissues such as the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. CE is always at risk of rupture and anaphylactic shock. About 3–17% of cases of hydatidosis lead to cyst rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Coughing, trauma and increased cyst size along with increased pressure inside the chest can lead to rupture of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Zakariai et al. presented a young woman with symptoms such as cough with excessive sputum, shortness of breath, salivation, nausea and vomiting with evidence of a large space-occupying lesion in the right lung with a diagnosis of CE. Unfortunately, following a severe cough in the patient, the CE ruptured, and she died of anaphylactic shock despite appropriate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our report, the patient’s cough, shortness of breath and chest pain were the main complaints. These symptoms may be mildly seen in intact CE. However, after entering the ward, he suffered from frequent and severe coughs, after which the pulmonary cyst ruptured and the contents of the cyst entered the bronchial space. Cavitary pulmonary lesions (CPL) occur in some different diseases, such as malignancies, infectious lung diseases and rheumatic disorders. On radiographic assessment of patients with pulmonary CE, several studies have shown evidence of CPL.\n\n【25】Recently, Taheri et al. reported that, for the first time, evidence of CPL was reported in the left lung of a patient with pulmonary lophomoniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Another causative agent of CPL is _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . According to the WHO report in 2020, tuberculosis is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. On clinical examination, it is impossible to distinguish between a ruptured hydatid cyst and lophomoniasis, and the clinical symptoms of both are frequently the same, ranging from chronic cough with or without sputum to chest pain, shortness of breath and sometimes hemoptysis. Therefore, examination of imaging findings can help in a better diagnosis of these diseases. It is noted that the lophomoniasis does not have pathognomonic radiological as well as bronchoscopic findings, and their findings are non-specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Some microbial infections have been associated to pulmonary hydatidosis in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, there have been no reports of _Lophomonas_ and CE co-infection. In the COVID-19 pandemic, however, _Lophomonas_ co-infection with other lung infections has been described. Using a molecular technique, Nakhaei et al. reported a co-occurrence of _Lophomonas_ infection in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The antibiotic metronidazole, at a dose of (500 mg three times a day for 2 weeks) orally or by injection (15 mg/kg 10 days) (in critical cases) for 2 weeks, is the standard treatment for lophomoniasis infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) can cause disease in immunocompromised patients as an opportunistic infection. To date, one co-infection of _Lophomonas_ with IPA has been reported in one immunocompromised patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> and several IPA cases have co-occurred with pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is noted that in some cases of pulmonary hydatidosis, such as mediastinal hydatidosis, a malignancy presentation may be mimicked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【28】Due to the similarity of clinical symptoms of lophomoniasis and hydatid cyst, it is highly recommended that physicians should consider _Lophomonas_ infection as an emerging and co-morbidity particularly in hydatid cyst endemic areas such as Iran. If CE is suspected, medical treatment should be started immediately because there is a possibility of pulmonary CE rupture following severe coughing and anaphylactic shock and death will occur.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declared none.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research was approved by the research ethics committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (IR.MAZUMS.REC.1397.2969).</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M.F. and M.H.T.J. were involved in the interpretation and collecting of data the manuscript.

We report a novel case of a 61-year-old Caucasian male with sarcoidosis presenting with recurrent chylothorax and chylous ascites. Pleural and ascitic fluid analysis revealed high triglyceride levels, consistent with chylothorax and chylous ascites, respectively. Common etiologies of chylous fluid such as thoracic duct surgical trauma, malignancy and infection were all excluded. Sarcoidosis was confirmed by the presence of non-caseating granulomas on a mediastinal lymph node biopsy. Conservative treatment with low-fat diet, prednisone, octreotide and multiple thoracenteses failed to effectively resolve the chylothorax.

It typically presents as interstitial lung disease with lymphadenopathy, primarily affecting African American women 20–40 years old. Our patient is an older Caucasian male with sarcoidosis who presented with rare complications of recurrent chylothorax and chylous ascites that failed conservative therapy.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old Caucasian male presented to the hospital for acutely worsening shortness of breath with chest tightness, productive cough and wheezing. His medical history includes sarcoidosis, COPD and a prior pleural effusion. The effusion was not investigated further due to its small size. He is a former smoker with a 32 pack-year smoking history. His vitals were as follows: temperature: 38.2°C; heart rate: 122 beats/min; respiratory rate: 28 breaths/min; oxygen saturation: 94% (on 2 l of oxygen). He had Type 1 respiratory failure with PaO <sub>2 </sub> of 57 mmHg (normal: 75–100 mmHg) and PaCO <sub>2 </sub> of 29 mmHg (normal: 35–45 mmHg). Procalcitonin level was 6.75 μg/l (normal: < 0.5 μg/l). Sputum culture, coronavirus disease 2019 testing and urine antigen testing for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Legionella pneumophila_ were all negative. A chest radiograph demonstrated interstitial pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. D-dimer was 2.2 μg/ml (normal: < 0.5 μg/ml). A chest computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism, and a standard chest CT confirmed a large right-sided loculated pleural effusion **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>** .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|\\[Chest radiography and thoracic computed tomography of the patient with sarcoidosis and prior pleural effusions.

A CT-guided thoracentesis and subsequent chest tube thoracostomy drained the pleural effusion, revealing white, cloudy fluid. Pleural fluid analysis revealed an elevated triglyceride level of 217 mg/dl, indicating chylothorax (diagnostic: > 110 mg/dl). Pleural fluid cytology was negative for malignancy. Pleural fluid gram stain, culture and acid-fast stain results were negative. A follow-up chest CT revealed hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple lung nodules and a dense right posteromedial hilar-pleural lung mass, suspicious for malignancy. Navigational bronchoscopy with transbronchial needle aspiration biopsies from the mass and multiple lymph nodes were all negative for malignancy, raising suspicion for autoimmune involvement.\n\n【8】For his recurrent chylothorax, a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed. Findings revealed extensive chyle seepage within the right anterior mediastinum near the pericardial fat pad, but no evidence of thoracic duct trauma. Suspected areas of chyle leakage from the thoracic duct and other lymphatic channels were ligated. Adjacent mediastinal lymph nodes were biopsied revealing non-caseating granulomas diagnostic for sarcoidosis **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 2 **)</u>** . Talc Pleurodesis was performed to reduce the pleural space. The patient was post-operatively managed with thoracostomy, octreotide, tapering prednisone and a low-fat diet. Chest tube drainage decreased, and he was discharged.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** and **B** ) Histopathological biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node within the pericardial fat pad revealed non-caseating granulomas.</u>\n\n【10】The patient required multiple follow-up outpatient visits for persistent shortness of breath and chronic cough. Multiple transthoracic ultrasounds revealed persistent right-sided pleural effusions. Routine thoracentesis drained chyle, and temporarily relieved symptomatology of recurrent chylothorax. He was continued on prednisone therapy. He later developed new-onset abdominal discomfort, and 10-pound weight gain. Physical examination revealed significant abdominal distention and lower extremity edema. Abdominal ultrasound and a follow-up abdominal CT revealed moderate-to-large ascites. A paracentesis was performed. Peritoneal fluid appearance and analysis was consistent with chylous ascites .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Transthoracic ultrasound revealed a right-sided loculated pleural effusion.

The octreotide and prednisone regimen were restarted. The patient’s shortness of breath and chronic cough improved. Imaging no longer reveals significant pleural effusions or ascites. He currently undergoes physical therapy.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Men are half as likely as women to have sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Caucasian men were four times less likely to be affected compared with African American women (40.02 vs 178.47 per 100 000, respectively; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>). Thus, this case of a Caucasian male with sarcoidosis is relatively rare.\n\n【16】Sarcoidosis commonly manifests in the lungs and lymph nodes, yet may affect multiple other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, pleuritic and peritoneal involvement is rare. Pleural effusions were reported in 1.1–3.0% of sarcoidosis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. To date, very few cases of chylous ascites are documented in patients with sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Furthermore, no other cases in available literature describe sarcoidosis with concurrent chylothorax and chylous ascites in a Caucasian male.\n\n【17】The exact pathophysiology of chylothorax and chylous ascites in sarcoidosis is unknown. However, few putative mechanisms have been proposed from related studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. First, inflammation from sarcoidosis invades the thoracic duct and other smaller lymphatics, resulting in chyle leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Second, bulky lymphadenopathy and intranodal fibrosis obstruct lymphatic flow through the thoracic duct and mesenteric lymphatics. The resulting congestion increases intraluminal pressure, resulting in chyle leakage into the pleural space and peritoneal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Sarcoidosis should be considered when investigating chyle leakage after more common etiologies are ruled out. In this patient, thoracic duct injury was ruled out by the lack of chest trauma and thoracic surgery history. Malignancy was excluded by negative lymph node and pleural biopsies and benign pleural fluid cytology. Tuberculosis was ruled out by negative sputum and pleural fluid cultures, and acid-fast staining. Sarcoidosis was confirmed by non-caseating granulomas in lymph node biopsies, and became the primary suspected cause of chyle leakage.\n\n【19】Conservative medical management with a low-fat diet, octreotide and prednisone initially helped manage this patient’s chylothorax. Long-chain fatty acids get absorbed directly into the lymphatic system via lacteals, forming chyle. However, low-fat diets only contain medium-chain fatty acids that bypass the lymphatic system, reducing chyle generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The somatostatin analog, octreotide, decreases chyle production by reducing mesenteric blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Decreased chyle production causes less chyle leakage from lymphatic channels. Prednisone reduces inflammation by inhibiting cytokine release, reducing lymphadenopathy and improving lymphatic flow. Thoracic duct ligation and pleurodesis are indicated when these conservative therapies fail **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 4 **)</u>** .\n\n【20】In essence, this case is a novel presentation of sarcoidosis due to uncommon patient demographics and thoracic duct involvement, resulting in chylothorax and chylous ascites. This case illustrates that sarcoidosis may be important in the differential when investigating recurrent chyle leakage. Similar rare cases require individualized treatment plans and referrals to sarcoidosis experts.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine for funding the article processing fee.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funded by Office of the Dean for Research and Scholarship, College of Osteopathic Medicine, University of New England.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by University of New England Office of Research Integrity (case # 011221-08).</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Verbal and written informed consent were obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Carol Brenner.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The patient initially was treated for empyema with antibiotics but later represented to hospital with worsening symptoms. He underwent a surgical Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure and lung biopsy, which revealed a diagnosis of mesothelioma. The young age of the patient as well as absence of significant risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis unexpected. The patient had total body irradiation (TBI) therapy for leukaemia as a child, which increases the risk of developing cancer. However, there are limited studies exploring the risk of pleural mesothelioma post-TBI. Young patients who represent to hospital, with limited response to initial treatment, and suspicious radiological features should be considered for lung biopsy to reduce the risk of a missed diagnosis. Patients with a background of TBI should also be considered for follow-up to monitor for any subsequent malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Mesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the mesothelium, most commonly presenting in the pleura. In the UK, it accounted for 1% of all deaths between 2016 and 2018. Mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos fibre exposure, and patients often have a background of occupational exposure. Other non-asbestos mineral fibres and therapeutic radiation are less common risk factors for developing mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Almost 20% of patients diagnosed with mesothelioma have no prior history of asbestos exposure. There are other identified causes of mesothelioma including: erionite mineral fibre, carbon nanotubes, irradiation treatment, thorium dioxide, viruses including the avian leukosis virus and also chronic serosal inflammation, such as that seen in familial mediterranean fever and chronic empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The presentation of symptoms can be as long as 40 years from asbestos exposure and deaths in the UK from mesothelioma commonly occurred between the ages of 85 and 89 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】This case report discusses an atypical presentation of pleural mesothelioma in a young patient in his 30s with no significant risk factors and absence of asbestos tissue in the body. The report considers total body irradiation (TBI) therapy contributing towards the diagnosis of mesothelioma and the clinical manifestations in this young patient.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 34-year-old male patient presented to hospital with a short history of persistent cough, shortness of breath and fever. The patient has a background of leukaemia as a child for which treatment included TBI. He also had thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a history of mental health issues. There is no family history of note. The patient reported having symptoms for three weeks prior to admission but no history of chest pain. On examination, he was noted to have reduced air entry on the left and was not clubbed. He was a non-smoker and there was no history of asbestos exposure. Blood results did not show raised inflammatory markers. The patient had a CT scan of the thorax which revealed marked pleural thickening with a left sided effusion . The patient refused pleural aspiration during this admission. The working diagnosis was empyema for which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient refused surgical intervention during this admission and his background of anxiety may have contributed to this decision. He was discharged with a prolonged course of oral antibiotics, with a view to early follow up.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CT scan of the thorax that shows left sided pleural thickening. CT scan of the thorax.</u>\n\n【8】Two months after his initial presentation to hospital, he was re-admitted due to worsening shortening of breath and chest pain. A repeat CT scan showed significant progression of his left sided pleural thickening with a new right sided effusion. Blood results again did not demonstrate a significant rise in infection markers. Microbiological and cytological analysis of pleural fluid did not reveal an obvious diagnosis .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【12】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\n【13】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【17】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\n【18】Open in new tab\n\n【19】With further counselling, he underwent a left Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure with pleural biopsy. The appearances were noted to be atypical for empyema as well as malignancy. There were post-inflammatory changes seen with a significantly thickened pleura, but no frank pus visible. Biopsies were taken from left lung parietal pleura, which confirmed an unexpected diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma T4 N1 M0 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|H&E x100—Parietal pleural tissue extensively infiltrated by epithelioid tumour cells forming cords, nests and tubular structures.

Sadly, the patient passed away 17 months after his initial presentation at the age of 35.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】The young age of the patient along with the absence of significant asbestos-related risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis of mesothelioma unexpected. Other factors should be explored which may have contributed to the development of mesothelioma.\n\n【25】The incidence of mesothelioma in those aged under 35 years old in the UK was 4 per 100 000, with the trend of incidence significantly increasing with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The young presentation of the patient without any known asbestos exposure would have suggested a low clinical suspicion of mesothelioma.\n\n【26】The patient underwent TBI therapy for the treatment of leukaemia during his childhood. The risk of developing cancer is increased after TBI. The latency of mesothelioma development after TBI was 29 years in our patient. The level of radiation along with age at which treatment was received can influence the clinical risk. A study looking at patients over a 45-year period found that higher dose radiation as well as treatment under the age of 20 significantly increased the risk of developing cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A further study also demonstrates that pulmonary toxicity increases after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】There is a difference in risk of secondary carcinogenesis between local radiation therapy and total body irradiation. A study looking at leukaemia in patients with cervical cancer who received local radiotherapy found that the risk of leukaemia increased two folds (RR = 2.0; 90% confidence interval = 1.0-4.2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The risk of malignant neoplasms increased by 2.8-fold after TBI (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval = 2.6-3.1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The study suggested lifelong monitoring for early detection of secondary carcinogenesis following TBI. There have been reported cases of peritoneal mesothelioma after TBI, however studies looking at reported cases of pleural mesothelioma are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The British childhood cancer survivor study that looked at outcomes of children diagnosed with cancer who may have received cancer treatment did not report any cases of pleural mesothelioma after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A systematic literature search has not shown any similar prior cases and, to the best of our knowledge, our case is the first of its kind.\n\n【28】The young age of onset of mesothelioma in this patient is an uncommon finding and the diagnosis could be missed or delayed in the clinical setting. In young patients diagnosed with clinical features of extensive pleural thickening, with a low suspicion of an infective aetiology, radiological investigation and subsequent biopsy should be considered early. Lifelong monitoring post-TBI therapy is also important for the early detection of secondary carcinogenesis. Although the risk of cancer is increased in patients with a background of TBI, further research into the risk of developing pleural malignant mesothelioma after TBI would be useful to guide clinical management.\n\n【29】DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n---------------------------\n\n【30】The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Doris Rassl for her assistance in interpreting the pathology samples.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

When occurring with an aortoenteric fistula, it represents a rare and potentially life-threatening disease state. We present the case of a 77-year-old gentleman initially treated as presumed ascending cholangitis. This was complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to an aortoenteric fistula and cholecystoduodenal fistula.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A cholecystoduodenal fistula (CDF) is the most common type of bilioenteric fistula, a pathological communication between the biliary system and the gastrointestinal tract. A CDF is specifically a connection between the gallbladder and duodenum, caused by gallstones, surgery, duodenal ulcers, malignant tumours and inflammatory bowel disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. The underlying pathophysiology differs between aetiologies. Most commonly, it is caused by chronic inflammation of the gall bladder leading to inflammatory adhesions to the adjacent duodenum, and subsequently eroded through by gallstone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Owing to varied symptomology, the diagnosis of CDF can be challenging.\n\n【4】The incidence of bilioenteric fistulas reported in the literature is 0.9% in the general population and 3.2% in patients diagnosed with biliary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common symptoms are epigastric pain and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Patients with bilioenteric fistulae can also present with either obstructive or non-obstructive symptoms. Non-obstructive symptoms include recurrent cholangitis and malabsorption, whilst obstructive symptoms include gallstone ileus, hematemesis or melena 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Another rare diagnosis is primary aortoenteric fistulas, which present with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. These occur in the absence of previous endovascular surgery and arise when inflammation of the aortic wall erodes into adjacent bowel. The most commonly cited aetiology is mycotic aortic aneurysms, as a result of bacterial seeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 77-year-old male was admitted to hospital for anorexia and deranged liver enzymes. He had no significant past medical history, no significant risk factors for liver disease and does not take regular medications. He denied abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. On presentation, he was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and had an unremarkable abdominal examination. However, his blood results showed cholestatic liver enzymes, with an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 145 unit/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(30–110)</u>, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 107 units/L (<55) and total bilirubin of 48 μmol/L (<20). He also had raised a white blood cell count and neutrophil count of 23.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (3.5–11.0) and 22.21 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–8 \\]</u> ×10/μL. An abdominal ultrasound showed no visible gallstones.\n\n【8】After fourteen inpatient days for monitoring and discharge planning, he became febrile and had worsening ALP and GGT, at 849 and 624 unit/L, respectively. His blood cultures showed _Escherichia Coli_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ bacteraemia. An initial diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed several hypodense focal liver lesions, multiple thrombosed portal vein branches, pneumobilia in the liver’s left lobe  and an incidental finding of a 5.8 cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|CT showing pneumobillia.</u>\n\n【10】He was commenced on Piperacillin–Tazobactam 4.5 g for sepsis from presumed ascending cholangitis. Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily was also started for new diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis. The patient initially responded well to medical therapy. However, two weeks later he had a large volume hematemesis and became clinically unstable. A repeat CT abdomen revealed interval increase in the size of the infra-renal AAA to 8 cm , raising the possibility of impending rupture and aortoenteric fistula.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT showing marked increase in infra-renal AAA size 2 weeks apart—left (previous), right (latter).</u>\n\n【12】Rivaroxaban was ceased. An urgent gastroscopy revealed large blood clots in the gastric fundus and body, with a pulsatile lesion at the second part of the duodenum (D2), which was suspicious for an aortoenteric fistula .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Endoscopy showing small aortoenteric fistula in D2.</u>\n\n【14】The patient underwent an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair to repair the aortoenteric fistula and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively.\n\n【15】One-week post-surgery, the patient complained of acute right lower limb pain and swelling. A Doppler ultrasound and CT abdomen angiogram revealed an extensive deep vein thrombosis in the right leg extending to the distal inferior vena cava. Senior staff deliberated the risks of anticoagulation and ultimately decided to commence an intravenous heparin infusion. Unfortunately, he experienced a second episode of hematemesis five days after despite remaining within therapeutic levels.\n\n【16】A third gastroscopy revealed a bleeding duodenal fistula at the D2/3 junction communicating with the gallbladder, confirming a diagnosis of CDF . A second laparotomy identified the fistula between the gallbladder to the lateral wall of the duodenum (D2), several stones and sludge in a contracted gallbladder and 6 mm stone in the ampulla. The fistula and the adjacent duodenal wall were repaired, and a cholecystectomy performed.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Endoscopy showing potential fistula in lateral wall of D2/D3, with clot sitting atop.</u>\n\n【18】In the next 24 hours, he had further hematemesis, following which a third laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a deep ulcer in D3. This ulcer formed another aortoenteric fistula with D3, with the aneurysm sac on this occasion bleeding into the duodenum from the iliolumbar arteries and inferior mesenteric artery. The aneurysm sac was opened, and the iliolumbar arteries and inferior mesenteric artery were closed from inside the sac.\n\n【19】The patient survived the surgeries, was admitted into ICU and later discharged from hospital with outpatient follow-up from subspecialty teams. Unfortunately, he was re-admitted 3 weeks later and passed away from an unrelated event.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】This case highlights the difficulty of diagnosing a bilioenteric fistula owing to the non-specific presentation, which could be explained by co-existing pathologies. Compounding this, our patient presented with symptoms found in both obstructive and non-obstructive patterns of presentation with CDF. Given the low incidence rates and faced with another rare diagnosis in the aortoenteric fistula, a bilioenteric fistula was not considered in the first instance.\n\n【22】The assumed series of events was that the initial sepsis from _E. Coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ noted on blood cultures are causes of cholangitis. The severity of the sepsis resulted in the complication of vascular thrombosis. A pre-existing AAA became mycotic and subsequently eroded into the duodenal wall within the D2 and D3 regions, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding concurrent with anticoagulation. The additional findings of a CDF were also notable, a rare complication of cholangitis and chronic gallstones. In retrospect, in the absence of previous biliary instrumentation, persisting pneumobillia on repeat imaging should have raised suspicion for CDF in this patient. Other reasons for pneumobillia include an incompetent sphincter of Oddi or infections of the biliary tract or liver. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may have been useful to define the anatomy and even detect enteric fistulous connections. In addition, there is a potential therapeutic role through stent placement and nasobiliary drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】This case effectively demonstrates how the combination of non-specific symptomology and multiple rare co-pathologies can lead to delayed diagnosis and management. It emphasizes the importance of considering rare complications of common pathologies, particularly if the clinical course does not progress as anticipated.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n-------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report did not require review by the relevant Ethics Committees.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient is deceased so obtaining consent was not possible.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by sustained hypereosinophilia associated with end-organ damage. Based on underlying molecular mechanism of eosinophilia, there are different subtypes of HES. Diagnosis of HES subtype can be challenging, especially in the absence of overt lymphoid/myeloid neoplasms or discernable secondary causes. Long-term outpatient follow-up with periodic complete blood count and repeated bone marrow biopsy may be needed to monitor disease activity. Somatic signal transducer and activation transcription 5b (STAT5b) N642H mutation was recently found to be associated with myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia.

He was in his usual state of health until 2 weeks earlier when he traveled to CA, where he was briefly hospitalized twice for chest pain, fever and diarrhea. He was diagnosed with ‘type B aortic dissection’, pneumonia and viral gastroenteritis.\n\n【6】He presented to our institute with dry cough and shortness of breath. He was on beta-blocker for recent diagnosis of ‘type B aortic dissection’. On physical examination, he was hypotensive (84/44 mm Hg) without tachycardia (88/min), afebrile, tachypneic (22/min) and hypoxic (SpO <sub>2 </sub> 85% at room air). There were bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. Initial differential diagnosis included aortic pathology, thromboembolism, infection and hematologic disorders. Electrocardiogram and serum troponin were normal. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed marked leukocytosis (50 k/μl) with eosinophilia (4.0 k/μl), thrombocytopenia (82 k/μl) and normal hemoglobin level (15.6 g/dl). Chest X-ray showed mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1a **\\]</u>** .

To confirm eosinophilia-related end-organ injury and rule out infection, diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed.

Prednisone was tapered off at 2.5 months. Repeated CT chest at 6 months revealed complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates. Patient followed with hematology/oncology service every 3 months. He continued to be asymptomatic with excellent performance status and no limitation in daily activities. However, 11 months after hospital discharge, CBC showed gradual worsening erythrocytosis (hemoglobin 18.8 g/dl and hematocrit 56%) with low serum erythropoietin level, and increase in eosinophils (3.2 k/μl). Bone marrow biopsy with NGS for myeloid mutation panel was performed at 4 months and 11 months post discharge. It revealed recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation and ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutation. Although no overt myeloid neoplasm was found, given reported association of STAT5b N642H mutation with myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, the working diagnosis evolved toward myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia. To control worsening erythrocytosis and eosinophilia, hydroxyurea 500 mg once daily was started. Cell counts subsequently improved. Given the inability to rule out myeloid neoplasm, patient was committed to long-term anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】HES with lung involvement can present as acute eosinophilic pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The radiographic manifestations can resemble pulmonary edema in the active phase with bilateral areas of ground glass opacity and smooth interlobular septal thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.

Frequently detected mutations by NGS are genes involving DNA methylation and chromatin modification, such as TET2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These mutations have also been frequently found in elderly general population (affecting about 10% of persons older than 70 years of age) and are associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus the detection of such mutations needs to be interpreted in the context of other clinical and pathological findings when establishing a diagnosis of clonal hypereosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Recurrent somatic activating STAT5b N642H mutation was recently found in seven cases of idiopathic HES and 20 cases of myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of STAT5b N642H mutation in patients with HES.\n\n【16】In summary, we reported a case of HES with recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation, suggesting possible underlying myeloid neoplasm.

The significance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica cannot be overemphasized. In most typical presentations, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not add value to confirm the diagnosis. If the clinical diagnosis is doubtful, nerve conduction study and magnetic resonance imaging may still be performed to exclude other mimicking pathologies.

The LFCN is a sensory branch of the lumbar plexus derived from the posterior divisions of the L2 and L3 spinal nerves. After emerging from under the lateral border of the psoas major muscle, the nerve courses inferolateral around the iliac fossa into a tunnel formed by the lateral attachment of the inguinal ligament and the anterior superior iliac spine. At the level of the inguinal ligament, the LFCN is susceptible to trauma and entrapment. As the nerve exits from the pelvis, it bifurcates into anterior and posterior branches, which provide sensation to the anterior and lateral thigh, respectively .\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old female cook at a childcare centre attended the General Medicine clinic with 2 months of persistent numbness and ‘burning’ sensation over the right anterolateral thigh. The symptoms were not aggravated by movement of the lower limb, and there were no relieving factors. She had no trauma to her back, right groin or thigh before the onset of symptoms. She had no backache, muscle ache or limb weakness. The bladder and bowel function were normal.\n\n【6】She had a history of minor back trauma > 30 years previously from which she made an uneventful recovery. She had well-controlled asthma on regular Seretide inhalers. She was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. Her general practitioner prescribed pregabalin 75-mg nocte and naproxen 275-mg twice daily to control the paraesthesia, but this offered her no relief.\n\n【7】Given the presenting complaint, a full neurological examination of the lower limbs was performed. She had no muscle wasting, and no deficits were elicited in tone, reflexes, power and coordination. The patient was able to demarcate a distinct area of paraesthesia on the anterolateral part of her right thigh. There were no overlying skin lesions on the paraesthetic area. Abdominal, inguinal and spine examinations were also unremarkable. She weighed 47.4 kg, and her body mass index was 23.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The yellow line is the right LFCN. The green line is the inguinal ligament.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral plexus using the routine lumbar plexus protocol revealed mild focal swelling in the right LFCN proximal to the foramen beneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine, compatible with underlying meralgia paresthetica . The rest of its length on the MRI showed no abnormality. There were no bony or soft tissue abnormalities within the pelvic cavity. Further investigations revealed a normal full blood count, renal function, thyroid function, vitamin B12 level and HbA1c of 5.5% (Normal < 6.4%). When the patient was reviewed in the clinic 4 months after the onset of symptom, she reported the paraesthesia had resolved completely and spontaneously.\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【13】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【17】Open in new tab\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Axial T2 FS image shoes mild focal swelling in the right LFCN underneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine.</u>\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a condition commonly seen in primary care, orthopaedic surgery, bariatric surgery, obstetrics and intensive care settings. It is less frequently encountered in a General Medicine clinic.\n\n【21】There are many causes of MP. Some mechanical causes include obesity, pregnancy, pelvic masses, wearing tight belts or trousers and orthopaedic procedures causing direct damage to the LFCN. Metabolic factors such as lead poisoning, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism are also associated with MP. In a series of 67 patients with MP, 10 patients (15%) had no associated condition, making idiopathic cause the second most frequent finding after obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although there was no apparent cause in our patient, the presence of focal swelling in the LFCN raises the possibility that recurrent microtrauma in her occupational role as a cook may have caused damage to the nerve pain fibres.\n\n【22】In this patient, the nerve conduction study (NCS) was reported as within normal limits. This finding is unsurprising because the NCS of the LFCN is often technically challenging to perform due to its anatomical position, the variations in its course, the presence of increased adipose tissue and the lack of a standard NCS protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In a retrospective, cross-sectional study from Korea, 26.9% of the patients with MP were found to have normal LFCN conduction study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This study suggests that NCS of the LFCN has a fairly low sensitivity in the diagnosis of MP and cannot be used as a substitute for a good history and appropriate physical examination. Nevertheless, an electrophysiological study may still be performed to rule out other mimicking diagnoses such as lumbar disk herniation and radiculopathy, especially if there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Traditional MRI is not routinely used to assess LFCN as signal intensity changes of small peripheral nerves are usually challenging to evaluate. It may be performed to exclude other conditions that may mimic MP such as metastasis in the iliac crest, lumbar disk herniation, lumbar radiculopathy and chronic appendicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–8 \\]</u>, and to identify other bony abnormalities that may cause compression along the course of the nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. With advancing technology, magnetic resonance neurography is increasingly being utilized to diagnose or exclude a neuropathy, assess the degree of nerve injury, characterize the culprit lesion causing nerve entrapment and aid radiological-guided injection of perineural medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the presence of neuropathy, the signal intensity of the injured nerve increases and is similar to the fluid-like signal intensity of the neighbouring vessels on T2 weighted imaging, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In conclusion, this case has highlighted the importance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. In most cases, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not help make the diagnosis. Raising awareness of meralgia paresthetica among physicians unfamiliar with the condition will prevent the overuse of investigations.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I thank Professor C.

Ocular metastasis secondary to gastrointestinal malignancy is rare. In managing patients with ocular metastasis, quality of life (specifically vision preservation) is one of the most important factors patients and providers consider when deciding on a treatment regimen. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have shown promising results as second-line therapy for patient with metastatic malignancy. We describe a novel case of a functionally monocular patient with known metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma who developed poor vision and a large choroidal lesion in his better seeing eye.

Choroidal metastasis may be a presenting sign of primary or recurrent malignancy, portends very poor survival rates, and is frequently associated with significant visual impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ocular metastases are present in up to 4% of patients with primary gastrointestinal malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, most commonly arising from the lower GI tract and rarely from the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.

We present a novel case of a patient with known esophageal adenocarcinoma who was found to have a new onset choroidal metastasis. The patient was treated with pembrolizumab with rapid visual improvement to 20/20 and complete resolution of the uveal mass.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 83-year-old Caucasian man with a history of a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema (receiving as-needed intravitreal bevacizumab injections in the right eye and advanced open-angle glaucoma with poor vision in the left eye) presented with new vision complaints. Six months earlier at his previous visit, his visual acuity was 20/20 with resolved branch vein occlusion. He described gradual painless loss of a half-moon of central vision in the right eye over a three-month period. Past medical history was pertinent for known recurrent HER2 receptor positive esophageal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and right pleural base as well as poor cardiac and functional status of 24-month duration. He was previously treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions 11 months earlier and completed local radiation to the primary esophageal mass 13 months earlier.\n\n【8】Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/150 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye (normal range 10–25 mm hg). Anterior segment slit lamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Posterior segment examination of the right eye was notable for a 10.5-sq-mm choroidal lesion centered along the inferior temporal arcade extending into the inferior macula with serous retinal detachment of the macula  with no additional lesions noted in either eye. In view of patient’s medical history, the mass was presumed to be choroidal metastasis secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Local and systemic treatment options including proton beam irradiation and immunotherapy were discussed with the assistance of the oncology team. Ultimately, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was selected to treat the lesion to preserve vision and maintain superior quality of life.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) Fundus photo of the right eye demonstrating a large inferior subretinal lesion.

Date et al. reported an excellent outcome in a patient with recurrent metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil and trastuzumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Other reports of choroidal metastasis of esophageal adenocarcinoma have been treated with external beam irradiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy and enucleation with variable improvement of visual symptoms but inevitable death from the systemic complications of the primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Quality of life is often compromised from these aggressive therapies.

The safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors continues to be under investigation, though it has been shown to have less adverse events than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced esophageal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Adverse events from anti-PD-1 therapy are thought to occur via excessive activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, which result in excessive inflammation in normal tissues. In a large meta-analysis of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced gastro-esophageal cancer, no major ocular-specific complaints were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, cases have described inflammatory ocular sequelae of pembrolizumab including serous retinal detachment, choroidal effusion and detachment, and posterior uveitis, including birdshot-like chorioretinopathy and retinal vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one particular case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma without ocular metastasis, after three months of pembrolizumab infusions the patient developed isolated biopsy-confirmed vitreous metastasis that was thought to be caused by pembrolizumab-mediated retinal vascular leakage.\n\n【17】In conclusion, pembrolizumab successfully and rapidly decreased the size of choroidal metastasis, restored vision without any adverse events and improved quality of life. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors offer promising treatment outcomes with improved side effect profile compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our patient demonstrated rapid improvement of lesion size and visual acuity without any adverse events observed at six months of follow-up.\n\n【18】FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES/FUNDING\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】None.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FROM PATIENT\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient (giving explicit permission for this report).</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Rare complications of this procedure include haemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumonia, mediastinitis and pericarditis (Asano F et al. Complications associated with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration: a nationwide survey by the Japan Society for Respiratory Endoscopy. _Respir Res_ 2013;14:50). I report an unexpected fracture of the tip of the EBUS-TBNA needle as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring during attempted insertion into a subcarinal node.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a relatively new procedure for assessing hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. It is generally safe, with a high degree of specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Its merit in assessing the mediastinal nodal staging for lung cancer is also recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. I report an unexpected event of the EBUS-TBNA needle tip snapping as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring during sampling of an enlarged subcarinal lymph node. After successful retrieval of the broken needle, the EBUS-TBNA sampling was completed using a new needle _._ Neither the patient suffered harm nor any damage occurred to the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man had wedge resection and mediastinal nodal clearance for a T2aN2M0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe, in November 2012. The patient declined a completion lobectomy. Hence he was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. He previously had excision of a T3N2M0 rectal cancer followed by chemotherapy, and was living with a long-term colostomy. No local or distant metastases from his rectal cancer were identified through more than 4 years of follow-up.\n\n【6】In November 2015, his surveillance contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed enlarged pre-carinal and sub-carinal lymph nodes, with the sub-carinal node showing central necrosis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT scan image showing the enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes with central necrosis.</u>\n\n【8】He had an EBUS bronchoscopy under sedation (midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg intravenously). The enlarged sub-carinal node was identified. Unexpectedly, the EBUS transbronchial sampling needle (22 gauge; Cook <sup>® </sup> , USA) hit a cartilage ring in right main bronchus just below the carina, and snapped, with a 15 mm broken end of the needle left stuck in the bronchial wall. The EBUS bronchoscope and the long part of the needle were removed _._ A video bronchoscope was introduced and the broken needle was retrieved by forceps _._ The patient was given top-up intravenous sedation with 2 mg midazolam and 50 mcg fentanyl and the EBUS procedure was completed using a new needle. The samples confirmed nodal recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma. Hence the patient was referred to the oncology service following a review of histology in the lung cancer multi-disciplinary team meeting.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】The first case of EBUS-TBNA needle breakage was described by Özgül _et al._ in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The accident had occurred while the needle was moved back and forth for sample collection during the third pass, following its successful introduction into the lymph node. In the current report, however, the needle broke at the first attempted pass as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring. Furthermore, the bronchoscopist was not aware of using excessive force, which might have caused the needle to break.\n\n【11】A recent national survey from Japan included 7345 EBUS-TBNA procedures, and reported a number of rare complications of EBUS-TBNA including bleeding, pneumothorax, infection such as pneumonia and mediastinitis, lignocaine toxicity, pericarditis and breakage of the EBUS bronchoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this survey, breakdown of the needle during EBUS-guided mediastinal node sampling was reported in 0.2% procedures only. However, it is not clear from the report whether these cases involved a complete break of the EBUS-TBNA needle, similar to the case described above, or simply had a minor kink in the needle, which sometimes does happen during sampling. The authors also did not further elaborate the outcome of the small number of procedures complicated by accidental needle breakdown or fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Fortunately in the case described here, there were no complications such as any harm to the patient or the EBUS bronchoscope getting damaged due to needle breaking in the right main bronchus. The patient remained stable post-bronchoscopy and was discharged the same day.\n\n【13】The bronchoscopist subsequently noted that the needle had snapped very close to the junction between the long, shiny electroplated portion and the coarse end of the needle , and wondered whether this junction is a relatively weak point along the length of the needle. Özgül _et al._ in their report had also noted the site of breakage close to the junction between the shiny long portion and the coarse short end of the needle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|The 15 mm tip of the EBUS-TBNA needle showing the site of fracture close to the junction between the long, shiny electroplated section and the coarse distal end.</u>\n\n【15】This unexpected event was discussed in the lung cancer multi-disciplinary team meeting and a report was filed on hospital's dedicated incident reporting website. The needle identifier number and batch number were noted and forwarded to the company supplying EBUS-TBNA needles to our endoscopy unit.

Mediastinal involvement from _S. intermedius_ is very rare. We present a case of 22-year-old male with newly detected mediastinal conglomerate nodal mass. On his way for bronchoscopy, he developed seizures and was found to have three brain lesions. The aspirate from brain biopsy grew _S. intermedius_ whereas the aspirate from mediastinum showed only acute inflammation. Follow up imaging after antibiotic treatment showed interval resolution of brain abscesses and the mediastinal mass. We believe that the patient had aspiration pneumonia from _S. intermedius_ which then metastasized to mediastinum and brain. Our aim is to make physicians aware of this unusual presentation of _S. intermedius_ infection as a mediastinal mass.

Along with _Streptococcus constellatus_ and _Streptococcus anginosus_ , it constitutes the _S. anginosus_ group, previously known as _Streptococcus milleri_ . _Streptococcus intermedius_ is known to cause pneumonia, endocarditis and abscesses in the liver, lung and brain in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Based upon severity, the infection may require medical as well as surgical management. We discuss a rare presentation and clinical course of _S. intermedius_ infection in a young man who developed mediastinal mass and brain abscesses secondary to its dissemination.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 22-year-old male from Ohio River valley in USA was referred for the evaluation of a newly detected mediastinal mass. His medical history was significant for three episodes of pneumonia treated with antibiotics in the last 1 year. His social history included cannabis abuse and binge drinking till loss of consciousness. Recent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest performed at outside hospital revealed a new 3.5–4.5 cm conglomerate nodal mass in the mediastinum compressing the main stem bronchi . For the further evaluation of the mass, an endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was planned for the next day.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT chest with 3.5 × 4.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> conglomerate nodal mass in the mediastinum compressing the main stem bronchi (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n【7】En route for EBUS-TBNA, he developed witnessed generalized tonic clonic seizures and was brought to the emergency department. On arrival, he was alert and oriented but complained of right upper extremity numbness and tingling. Physical examination revealed right facial droop, right pronator drift and brisk reflexes on the right side. Laboratory data showed elevated white blood cell count of 15 000/μL and elevated platelet count of 640 000/L. Emergent CT brain revealed supra-tentorial lesions in the fronto-parietal area, right thalamus, and posterior right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain confirmed the findings and better delineated the lesions . The differential included malignancy and infection, but in discussion with the radiology team, the MRI images were considered to be more likely infectious.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|MRI brain showing supra-tentorial lesions: ( **A** ) Axial T2 weighted image demonstrating one of the three masses in the right thalamus with a T2-hypointense rim and a modest amount of surrounding vasogenic edema. **B** ) A thick rim of enhancement seen along the periphery of the mass on the axial gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted image.

The cultures from the EBUS-TBNA were negative for bacterial and fungal infections. The following day, he underwent stereotactic right temporal lobe biopsy with aspiration of purulent material diagnosing an abscess. He had subsequent aspiration of the other two brain abscesses. Brain biopsy showed focal acute and chronic inflammation with mild gliosis. The purulent aspirate from the brain lesions grew _S. intermedius_ . Based on the microbiological sensitivities the antibiotic regimen was consolidated to intravenous ceftriaxone and later to meropenem due to development of rash with the former drug. Transthoracic echocardiography was negative for endovascular infection. Dental examination was also unrevealing. He was discharged on intravenous meropenem to complete 6 weeks of therapy.\n\n【10】Upon completion of intravenous antibiotics at 6 weeks, CT chest showed near-total resolution of the conglomerate mediastinal nodal mass . He also experienced significant improvement in his neurological deficits. Follow-up MRI brain revealed interval reduction in the size of the abscesses and no mass effect. He was placed on oral amoxicillin–clavulanate for 4 more weeks. At 3-month follow up he had full resolution of symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|complete resolution of the mediastinal nodal mass on the follow-up chest CT at 6 weeks.</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】_Streptococcus intermedius_ has been implicated in a variety of purulent infections and abscesses with predilection towards brain and liver. The production of intermedilysin, a human specific cytolysin by _S. intermedius_ is considered as the virulent factor in producing abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Giuliano _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> showed that all the disseminated cases of _S. intermedius_ had multiple brain abscesses.\n\n【14】Our patient had history of cannabis and alcohol abuse. He had recurrent pneumonia most likely from aspiration during his binge drinking. The development of lung and brain abscesses from _S. intermedius_ in a young patient with substance abuse has been previously reported by Traube _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We believe that _S. intermedius_ , a part of oral flora, was aspirated during these episodes and led to pneumonia. The bacteria then spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes causing mediastinitis and finally a conglomerate mediastinal mass. The infection hematogenously spread to the brain causing multiple abscesses leading to seizures. Till now, there is only one reported case of mediastinal abscess from _S. intermedius_ . It was caused by direct contamination of the lymph nodes with the oral flora during EBUS-TBNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To best of our knowledge, this is the first ever reported case of _S. intermedius_ infection presenting as a mediastinal mass due to mediastinitis secondary to recurrent pneumonia.\n\n【15】A diagnosis of _S. intermedius_ infection requires isolation of the organism from the fluid or tissue cultures. All the involved sites should be accessed until the organism is identified. In our patient, the cultures from brain aspirate grew _S. intermedius_ whereas the cultures from EBUS-TBNA were negative. Given the clinical improvement and radiological disappearance of the mediastinal mass with antibiotic treatment, we believe that the mediastinal mass was also caused by _S. intermedius_ .\n\n【16】Our aim is to make fellow physicians aware of _S. intermedius_ infection as a differential for mediastinal mass in a patient who is at risk for aspiration, or has history of recurrent pneumonia, or has multiple brain lesions. In the appropriate clinical setting, _S. intermedius_ can translocate from the oral cavity to the lungs and can further metastasize to the mediastinum and the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. If there are lesions involving multiple organs, an effort should be made to isolate the organism from the involved body sites and fluid cavities to confirm the etiology. In cases with documented or recurrent _S. intermedius_ infection, solitary mediastinal mass can be followed for resolution with appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent provided by the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Shahistha Hameed.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination and image studies showed a massive tumor of the nasopharynx, extending from the left-sided skull base to supraglottic structures. Histopathologic evaluation revealed the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated RMS. Due to the primary tumor size and involvement of crucial structures, extensive surgical excision was not amenable. Thus, the patient was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although very rare, nasopharyngeal RMSs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adult patients. This case report illustrates the difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of rare head and neck malignancies and encourages its reporting.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was first mentioned by Weber in Virchow’s Archives in 1854 and describes a malignant soft tissue neoplasm of skeletal muscle origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. RMS constitutes more than 50% of all soft tissue sarcomas in children but is exceedingly rare in adults. Less than 1% of all adult malignancies are soft tissue sarcomas, of which RMS accounts for only 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most common histologic variants encountered in children and adolescents are embryonal and alveolar subtypes, whereas the pleomorphic subtype and RMS not otherwise specified are more frequently seen in adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. RMS can arise in a variety of anatomic sites throughout the body but the most common primary tumor sites include the head and neck region, followed by the genitourinary and extremity primaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Routinely, patients are diagnosed with an asymptomatic mass or show symptoms that are associated with mass effects of the primary tumor site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is made by image studies including computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as tissue biopsies of the suspected mass. Treatment of RMS is multimodal and includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, RMS of the head and neck region are rarely amenable to extensive surgical excision due to proximity of vital structures. The outcome of adults with RMS appears to be worse than that of children with a 5-year overall survival rate of 27% versus 61%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To date, only a handful of cases of nasopharyngeal RMS in adult patients have been reported in the English literature. We report a case of an aggressive pulmonary metastasized RMS of the nasopharynx in an adult patient who was initially misdiagnosed and treated conservatively.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 24-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our outpatient department for persistent hoarseness and a painless left-sided neck mass. Both symptoms had developed 6 weeks ago and progressively worsened. Additionally, cervical radiculopathy occurred and was treated with non-beneficial physical therapy. Apart from being a premature born twin, status post-appendectomy and status post-tonsillectomy, the patient’s past medical and family histories were unremarkable. In physical examination, a painless, hard and non-mobile left-sided neck mass could be found in level II. With ultrasound of the neck a non-specific hypoechoic mass could be correlated . Endoscopic examination showed the left-sided palatal arch and pharyngeal wall to be protracted and unilateral paralysis of the left vocal cord. The patient’s tongue pointed leftwards and showed muscle fasciculation. Laboratory testing showed normal blood count and non-elevated inflammation parameters. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the head and neck was performed and revealed a 6.1 cm × 3.1 cm × 7.0 cm well-circumscribed, homogeneous, contrast-enhanced tumor extending from the left-sided skull base to supraglottic structures . Also, two suspicious lymph nodes were found in the left-sided neck in level II. Additionally, a contrast-enhanced CT angiography showed the lateralization of the carotid artery and indentation of the internal jugular vein but ruled out infiltrative tumor growth and bone erosion . Naso- and oropharyngeal tissue biopsies of the tumor plus ultrasound-guided tissue biopsies of the suspicious lymph nodes were performed. Histopathological evaluation was performed in our pathology department plus a referral center and revealed the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated RMS, whereas patterns of alveolar RMS or Myo-D1 mutant could not be identified. The case was discussed in an interdisciplinary tumor board. In conclusion, the tumor was defined as a poorly differentiated RMS of the nasopharynx with bilateral pulmonary metastases (T4N1M1). Rapidly emerging symptoms as recurrent syncope and increasing paralysis of affected cranial nerves IX, X and XII favored emergency irradiation of the parapharnygeal space and skull base, which was initiated 1 month after the first consultation of the patient. The patient received a total dose of 54 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions (1.8 Gy/fraction), followed by three courses of chemotherapy according to CWS guidance. At the time this case report was prepared, the patient received the last course of chemotherapy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Ultrasound of the left-sided neck showed a non-specific hypoechoic mass.

Parameningeal RMS include RMS of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, nose, middle ear, mastoid, infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa, whereas nonparameningeal RMS include RMS of the orbit, parotid gland, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The head and neck region accounts for most RMS, with the orbit being the most frequent primary tumor site, followed by the oral cavity. In contrast, RMS rarely presents originating from the nasopharyngeal space as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, when the patient was admitted at our institution, she had asymmetric endoscopic findings and experienced hoarseness as well as a painless left-sided neck mass. A variety of clinical symptoms can occur with soft tissue carcinomas mostly lacking a cardinal sign. Therefore, most patients have an advanced disease at the stage of initial presentation. RMS exhibit fast and aggressive tumor growth, reaching large dimensions, and are typically painless but associated with generalised metastases and high rates of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The most common site of metastasis is the lung, followed by metastases to the bone marrow. Other common metastases are found in bone or distant nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. RMS often is difficult to diagnose because of its resemblance with other malignancies of the head and neck region. To date, no clear risk factors for RMS have been identified. Compared with other soft tissue carcinomas, prognosis of RMS is relatively poor but depends on clinical staging and the anatomical site of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. When such lesion is suspected, tissue biopsy analysis is the key to diagnosis, and should be performed as soon as possible. A careful histological examination is required to differentiate RMS from other more frequent and aggressive lesions affecting the concerned site. For the head and neck region, the embryonal subtype is most commonly found and frequently occurs in children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Once a diagnosis is made, a combined, multimodal therapeutic approach involving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is needed for the management of RMS. The basic goal of RMS therapy is locoregional control, and prevention or treatment of systemic metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pulmonary metastasized poorly differentiated RMS of the nasopharynx in an adult patient. This case report demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach in cases of rare malignancies. Early image studies and timely biopsies should be of notice when RMS is suspected to accelerate the start of a targeted and appropriate therapy. Physicians should be aware of various atypical presentations of rare malignancies, so that further measures can be taken. Nasopharyngeal RMS, although very rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adult patients.\n\n【11】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【12】None.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Professor Matthias, Professor of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PATIENT CONSENT FORM\n--------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, acute liver injury in AOSD patients can have various other causes: it can be a result of an AOSD-induced macrophage activation syndrome or be associated to the drugs given for the underlying diseases and symptoms. Differential diagnosis can therefore be challenging. We here present a case of a 32-year-old male with acute liver injury following the initial diagnosis of AOSD to discuss the possible underlying reasons.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Recently, it has been demonstrated that liver dysfunction is one of the most prevalent features of patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) induced by adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Moreover, liver involvement has been described as a direct complication of AOSD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

The figure demonstrates the evolution of aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) in this patient with acute liver injury after the diagnosis of AOSD. Treatment with anakinra had been started 9 days before the onset of liver injury and was continued until the onset of liver injury. Concomitant medication before liver injury was prednisolone with an initial dosage of 75 mg daily from Days 16 to Day 3 before liver injury and Day 41 to Day 13 before liver injury. After the onset of liver injury he received a pulse therapy with prednisolone and then was started on canakinumab.</u>\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We here report the case of a 32-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed with AOSD following presentation with pharyngitis, fever ≥39°C, rash, arthralgia and leucocytosis, all of which belong to the classification criteria for AOSD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. He was started on high-dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) and anakinra (100 mg/d). A total of 21 days after the initiation of prednisolone and 9 days after the initiation of anakinra the patient presented at our hospital with acute liver injury. Upon admission, he showed highly elevated aminotransferases (AST 1139 U/l, ALT 2617 U/l, upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\] 49 U/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (1920 U/l, ULN 249 U/l) as well as hyperferritinemia(71 900 ng/ml, ULN 400). However, coagulation parameters, as indicators of liver function, were preserved, and no signs of hepatic encephalopathy were present. Following admission, the patient had non-remittent fever and reappearance of the arthralgia. Because drug-induced liver injury (DILI) could not be ruled out, all medications, including ibuprofen, which he had been taking per request for the arthralgia, were discontinued. Other causes for liver injury such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic, metabolic or ischemic hepatic disorders were ruled out. The further work-up included liver biopsy and a bone marrow examination. Liver histology showed a mild chronic active hepatic inflammation with perivenously accentuated necrosis and portal inflammation without relevant interface hepatitis and was classified as most likely drug-induced hepatic injury. There were no signs of a relevant infiltration with plasma or eosinophilic cells, no cholestasis and no fibrosis. The bone marrow analysis, however, revealed hypercellularity with a left shift of haematopoiesis and a strongly intensified granulopoiesis. In addition, hemophagocytosis was demonstrated. Based on these findings, AOSD-induced MAS was suspected and the patient was treated with high-dose prednisolone and later on a monoclonal antibody directed against interferon-1ß (canakinumab). After the initiation of prednisolone, aminotransferases started to decline together with a significant reduction of ferritin . However, the patient experienced persisting symptoms, in particular fever, which decreased upon the initiation of canakinumab accompanied by a further decline of aminotransferases. A total of 54 days after, the onset of liver injury the patient reached remission.\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】This case demonstrates the challenge of differential diagnosis of acute liver injury in patients with AOSD. Liver injury can be due to the underlying disease itself or to AOSD-induced MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, DILI due to the immunosuppressive treatment is another diagnosis to be considered. In this respect anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, has been associated with acute hepatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Identifying the cause of liver injury has major implications for the individual patient: intensifying immunosuppressive treatment is necessary in the case of MAS-induced liver injury, whereas suspending all unnecessary medication is the consequence in the case of DILI. As for the reported case, DILI was initially suspected due to the temporal association with the institution of anakinra and the histopathological features present in the liver biopsy. However, hyperferritinemia, persisting fever and the finding of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow analysis directed the diagnosis towards MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Since the patient was initiated on corticosteroid treatment shortly after the onset of liver injury, which can have beneficial effects on the evolution of DILI patients as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>, the final diagnosis remains equivocal. Importantly, DILI secondary to newer biologicals used for immunosuppression is still not well understood and clinical pictures may vary from DILI due to conventional medication, and thus DILI is often not identified until liver injury has become severe. In conclusion, acute liver injury in patients with AOSD can have various reasons including DILI, which should be considered in such patients, especially if immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory treatment has already been initiated.\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We want to thank Monika Hofstetter for the excellent technical support.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

Here, we describe a 67-year-old male who presented with atypical symptoms of worsening headaches associated with left-sided pupil-sparing, isolated third nerve palsy, blurry vision, diplopia and myalgias in bilateral extremities. He was immediately started on intravenous Methylprednisolone for suspected GCA. Subsequent biopsy of the temporal arteries showed panarteritis without giant cells and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. His symptoms improved in a day following treatment and he was discharged on a Prednisone taper. At the time of writing this case, there are only two cases in the literature of ptosis as a presenting symptom in GCA, thus highlighting the importance of recognizing rare red flag symptoms such as ptosis and diplopia. More study is needed in the prognostic significance of these unusual clinical features.\n\n【2】giant cell arteritis , ptosis , diplopia\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also commonly known as temporal arteritis, is a disease with severe morbidity, largely due to the devastating permanent visual loss that can affect up to 15–25% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It remains a disease of older Caucasians, with the highest incidence noted in Scandinavians and populations descended from them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although most healthcare providers are aware of the common red flag symptoms of GCA such as blurriness of vision, headache and jaw claudication, lesser known manifestations such as isolated third nerve palsies (ptosis), diplopia and Horner’s syndrome can also occur. In fact, there are only two reported cases in the literature of isolated third nerve palsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, highlighting the significance of this unusual symptom in what is already a rare condition.\n\n【5】Here, we describe an interesting case of GCA which first presented as ptosis and diplopia.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with progressively worsening headache that started 5 weeks prior. He described his headache as constant, sharp, localized to bilateral temporal regions with radiation to the eyes, waking him up from sleep and minimally relieved with Ibuprofen use. He denied having similar symptoms in the past. Four weeks after his headache started, he noted new left eyelid drooping with tearing, redness, double and blurry vision . The double vision had resolved upon presentation. In addition, he also described myalgias in all four extremities for ~2 weeks, limiting him from lifting his arms above his head or getting up from a squatted position. Past medical history was notable for COPD, hypertension and 80 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam was significant for trace left ptosis, conjunctival injection; visual acuity was 20/70 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left with unremarkable appearance of the optic nerves.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Patient 1 week prior to presentation.</u>\n\n【9】Laboratory studies obtained were significant for elevated C-reactive protein: 14.4 \\[reference range (RR): <1.0 mg/dl\\] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 54 (RR: 0–20 mm/h). Other laboratory work including thyroid stimulating hormone, creatinine kinase, vitamin D level, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed non-calcified pulmonary nodules without any concerning features. This constellation of findings was highly suspicious for temporal arteritis associated with polymyalgia rheumatica and he was immediately started on 1000 mg of intravenous Methylprednisolone given daily for 3 days. Imaging studies including CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiogram of head and neck were noted to be unremarkable. Bilateral temporal artery biopsy was obtained, which showed panarteritis, predominantly lymphocytes admixed with few histiocytes and occasional eosinophils. Giant cells were not seen. Elastic stain highlighted the disruption of internal elastic lamina .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Elastic staining of left temporal artery showing disruption of the internal elastic lamina (green arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Elastic stain showing disruption of internal elastic lamina of right temporal artery (green arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Patient 2 weeks after initiation of treatment.</u>\n\n【13】Patient reported improvement in symptoms after 2 days of steroids and he was discharged on a Prednisone taper. Two weeks after discharge, he reported feeling much better with only very mild headache and no visual symptoms at all .\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】GCA is a granulomatous vasculitis that affects medium-to-large vessels. GCA more commonly affects females and those over the age of 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its effects have been known to be devastating, with permanent visual loss being one of the known complications. Early diagnosis and treatment have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of irreversible blindness in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】ACR has well-known criteria for the diagnosis of GCA  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> since 1990. Three out of five are considered to be positive with a high sensitivity and specificity. Currently, these criteria are undergoing possible revision with the inclusion of imaging validations. Temporal artery biopsy is considered the gold standard; however, it has a sensitivity of only 15–40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. About 25% of biopsies do not show granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> as demonstrated in our patient above.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|ACR criteria for GCA.</u>\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of GCA remains poorly understood. One of the mechanisms appears to be the innate pathway in which there is recognition of host cells as foreign by dendritic cells, with activation of the inflammatory cascade, the key mediators being CD4+, IFN-y and IL-6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The other important mechanism is the antigen-driven response, by which vessels are affected—the arterial walls are compromised, resulting in focal ischemic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】As noted above, visual disturbances are important diagnostic symptoms, including visual loss, either partial or complete; amaurosis fugax; double vision and ocular pain. Of these, diplopia occurs rarely and is present in ~5–10% of GCA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, though this is likely underreported due to its transient and retrospective nature, as it was for our patient. Diplopia is associated with higher incidence of permanent visual loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Ptosis in GCA remains even more rare. Though there have been some reports in the literature of Horner’s syndrome in GCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>, pupil-sparing isolated third nerve palsies were only noted twice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u> The pathogenesis behind ptosis or Horner’s syndrome remains obscure, likely due to the rarity of this manifestation; however, evidence points to muscle ischemia as the cause behind the visual compromise. In an autopsy done of a patient with ophthalmoplegia secondary to GCA, the extraocular muscles were noted to be necrosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, suggesting that GCA contributes to internal and external carotid artery ischemia and, subsequently, muscle ischemia and necrosis. There are no data on the effect of Horner’s syndrome or isolated third nerve palsies on the prognosis of visual loss in GCA. This remains to be further studied.\n\n【21】Corticosteroids remain the first line of treatment in GCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In patients with neurological or ophthalmological manifestations, the equivalent of Prednisone at 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days is initiated after which a maintenance dose is started. In patients without visual involvement, 40–60 mg/day can be given to patients. Corticosteroids are often needed for months and it is important to give concurrent PPI as well as calcium and vitamin D supplementation.\n\n【22】Methotrexate has an important role in patients who are steroid-reliant by reducing the dosage required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Recently, Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6 receptor humanized monoclonal antibody, has been used as a steroid-sparing drug with excellent remission rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】GCA is a time-sensitive disease—early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing vision loss. Interestingly, ptosis and diplopia happen to be very rare ophthalmic symptoms of GCA. Hence, patients presenting with isolated third nerve palsies should be carefully assessed for high-risk vasculitis such as GCA.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Anoka Martis.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present an as-of-yet unreported case of actinomycosis in an 81-year-old gentleman who was found to have right-sided peritonitis and small bowel obstruction 11 months after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A complex loculated lesion was found on laparotomy with a protracted course of antibiotics being needed for treatment. The rarity of this condition will mean it remains a surprise diagnosis to many clinicians. However, it is important that clinicians maintain some index of suspicion to prevent unnecessary surgery and are aware of the protracted course of antibiotics that is needed for successful treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Actinomycosis refers to a progressive suppurative and granulomatous disease process attributed to a member of the actinomyces family; of which, _Actinomyces israelii_ is the most common causative organism. These microaerophilic bacteria are usually contained within the gastrointestinal, oral and genitourinary tracts, although if the mucosa is breached they can give rise to pathology. The common sites for infection are cervico-facial (60%), abdomen (20%) and pelvis (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with a subacute to chronic infective course possibly due to the relapsing and remitting nature of actinomycosis. As a result, it can take many years for actinomycosis to present clinically.\n\n【4】To further complicate the clinical features of abdominal actinomycosis, any organ within the abdomen can be affected as tissue planes can be crossed and fistulae or sinuses formed. Unsurprisingly, actinomycosis has been confused with tumours, inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, diverticular disease and peri-anal pathology. Various case reports reflect on pseudotumour-like syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, intra-abdominal collections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and varying degrees of peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This has led to actinomycosis being described as ‘a master of disguise’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】There have also been reports of iatrogenic actinomycosis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>. These case series all report biliary spillage, a lost stone or a gangrenous gall bladder at the time of surgery. Nevertheless, although such spillage is a relatively common intraoperative occurrence, progression to actinomycosis is rare. We present an as-of-yet unreported but life-threatening presentation of actinomycosis peritonitis in a patient with a recent history of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 81-year-old male was admitted to hospital with a 1-day history of faeculent vomiting and a 3-week history of a change in his bowel habit. He also described right-sided rib and hip pain, which required opiate analgesia prescribed by his general practitioner. On direct questioning, he admitted two stones of unintentional weight loss. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation (on warfarin) and hypertension. He had undergone an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy 11 months earlier for gallstone disease. At the time of surgery, there was minimal bile and stone debris spillage, which was nevertheless thoroughly irrigated and washed out.\n\n【8】On this admission, he was apyrexial, normotensive and normocardiac. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension with generalized abdominal pain and right flank/right upper quadrant peritonitis. Bowel sounds were absent, and rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. Laboratory testing revealed a high leucocyte count of 22.7 (10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and a C-reactive protein of 290 (mg/l). Plane abdominal and chest radiographs showed dilated loops of proximal small bowel and faecal loading; however, no evidence of pneumoperitoneum was present. A subsequent abdominal CT scan confirmed this pattern of bowel dilatation and while no clear cut-off point was visible, a right sub-hepatic multiloculated collection extending down the right lateral abdominal was seen . Generalized pneumobilia was also noted .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|A complex and loculated collection almost surrounding the liver and tracking down the right paracolic gutter. Faecal loading is also noted.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Peri-hepatic fluid is shown with marked pneumobilia present.</u>\n\n【11】With both the clinical and radiographic pictures pointing towards small bowel obstruction in the presence of a collection, perforation, ischaemia and underlying tumour were all possible differential diagnoses despite the CT findings. Due to the clinical uncertainty and the presence of obstruction, it was felt that the patient should undergo emergency laparotomy rather than percutaneous drainage of the collection to help identify and rectify the underlying pathology and relieve the obstruction. However, during the procedure, no perforation was found. The large purulent right upper quadrant collection was identified. Pus was aspirated and sent for microbiological culture, but was not examined for sulphur granules nor retained for subsequent examination. No other gross pathology was found, and a thorough abdominal lavage was performed. His postoperative improvement was slow and complicated by significant sepsis requiring intensive care admission for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and inotropic support. Eight days later, _A. israelii_ was isolated , and under microbiological guidance, treatment with tazobactam and piperacillin (Tazocin™) 4.5 g three times daily was continued.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Image of the species of _A. israelii_ grown.</u>\n\n【13】After completing a 2-week course, he was discharged home with a further 2-week course of intravenous Tazocin, followed by oral penicillin. Routine blood testing by the general practitioner showed persistently raised inflammatory markers. A repeat ultrasound scan of the abdomen at 8 weeks post discharge revealed a collection of extra-luminal fluid adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall measuring 8 × 9 × 7 cm. This was drained under ultrasound guidance, and the patient commenced on a further 3-month course of oral penicillin after which he made a full recovery.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Intra-abdominal actinomycosis is a rare complication of abdominal surgery with a variety of presentations from subacute infection to florid peritonitis with obstruction. The period between insult and presentation can vary from 1 to 11 years due to its low virulence potential and a relapsing–remitting course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Yet it is not just the rarity of actinomycosis that complicates its diagnosis. The presenting symptoms are usually non-specific including pain, malaise, fever, weight loss and the pressure effect of the granuloma on adjacent structures. Even when the disease process is identified, culture of Actinomyces is negative in up to 76% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The precipitating causes described in the literature are also broad, and include appendicitis, diverticulitis, intestinal perforation, trauma, bowel infarction, haemorrhage, cholecystitis, use of interuterine devices and bowel surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The severity of infective sequelae means that clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion for two reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention, although preoperative microbiological culture may not be possible. Secondly, without prolonged and specific antibiotic treatment, relapse can occur causing further morbidity and mortality. Suggested treatment regimens include surgical drainage and removal of affected tissue, with a 6- to 12-month course of high-dose penicillin.\n\n【17】In summary, although both perforation causing sepsis and pseudotumour-like obstruction are recognized in the literature, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first account of bowel obstruction caused by intra-abdominal sepsis in the absence of perforation. We feel that the most likely source of sepsis was either bile or stone fragment spillage, or transposition of bacteria while the gallbladder was inflamed. The rarity of actinomycosis means it will continue to be a surprise diagnosis in a majority of cases.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Mark Alexander, Consultant Radiologist, Department of Radiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital and also Dr Rohinton Mulla, Consultant Microbiologist, Department of Microbiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We treated a patient with a partial-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon by a series of four type I porcine collagen ultrasound-guided injections, at weekly intervals. At the same time the patient underwent physical therapy, consisting of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises. The patient was assessed before the treatment and up to 18 months after the last injection by the Constant–Murley score, the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and ultrasonography. Shoulder pain and functional limitation progressively improved and they almost completely disappeared at the last follow-up. Ultrasonography showed a gradual healing of the partial-thickness tear and a regeneration of the tendon structure. This is the first study on ultrasound-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Future research should confirm the excellent result achieved in this case report.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Partial-thickness rotator cuff tear (PTRCT) is one of the most common shoulder injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The supraspinatus (SSP) tendon is the most affected in PTRCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The treatment of PTRCTs remains disputed; non-operative treatment is the first approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Many injectable therapies have been proposed in the last years with controversial effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. According to literature, this is the first study on ultrasound (US)-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of PTRCTs.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In March 2018, a 55-year-old right-handed housewife came to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Practice complaining of pain and functional limitation in the left shoulder, lasting 2 months. She didn’t report neither systemic or genetic disorders, nor previous traumas or surgical interventions and nor allergies or intolerances. She suffered from hypothyroidism and she was in treatment with sodium levothyroxine. She didn’t smoke. She was habitually practising free-body gymnastics twice a week. She had already treated the shoulder pain with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, without improvements.\n\n【6】Based on physical examination we suspected left SSP tendon involvement. We excluded glenohumeral osteoarthritis by X-rays. Shoulder ultrasonography, performed by a radiologist with >20 years of experience in skeletal muscle US, revealed a partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the SSP tendon (Grade II according to Ellman classification). We decided to treat the patient with a series of four US-guided intratendineous injections of 2-ml porcine type I collagen at weekly intervals in combination with physical therapy. After a full and clear description of the study, the patient was invited to sign the informed consent.\n\n【7】Injections were performed by a single doctor with >10 years of experience using an anterior approach. The patient was seated on a chair with the arm in internal rotation in order to expose as much of the SSP tendon as possible. This position was best achieved by placing the patient’s arm behind her back. A 22-gauge needle was directed towards the tear of the SSP tendon as guided by US until the tip of the needle was seen in the correct position and then the collagen was injected slowly.\n\n【8】Physiokinesitherapy was performed starting from the first injection and during 4 weeks, three times a week, 30 minutes per session and consisted of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises, with the aim to recover range of motion and strength of the shoulder.\n\n【9】The patient was evaluated at the time of enrolment (T0), right before the third injection (T1), and 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after the last injection by means of the Constant–Murley (CM) score and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Clinical data are reported in Table 1 and their trends illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【13】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【17】Open in new tab\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Outcome measures of the CM score and the DASH questionnaire over the time.</u>\n\n【19】US assessment was performed at T0, T3 and T4 by the same expert radiologist. As shown in Fig. 2 , longitudinal US of the SSP tendon at T0 showed a well-defined hypoechoic area, indicating partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the tendon, without retraction (Grade II according to Ellman classification). Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (Grade I according to Ellman classification). Eventually, the T4 US assessment no longer showed tear within the tendon, which in addition appeared quite regular and isoechoic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|US assessment of the SSP tendon across multiple follow-up intervals.

( **c** ) At 18-month follow-up, the tendon looked quite regular and isoechoic, without any sign of tear (arrow).</u>\n\n【21】The patient was totally compliant, following all the appointments given. No adverse events have been described after collagen injections.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】According to literature, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of shoulder US on rotator cuff tear detection has a range of 46–95% and 50–95%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The variability is highly correlated with the level of experience of the operator and the patterns of the rotator cuff tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Non-operative treatment is the first approach to PTRCTs, and surgical option has to be considered when the conservative treatment has not effect within the first 6–12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical therapy is the first-line treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rest from exacerbating activity, especially repetitive overhead activity and heavy lifting, can improve the pain component. Cortisone injections may be helpful in alleviating pain in conjunction with physical therapy but offer only short-term effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Different injectable therapies have been proposed in the past years for the treatment of PRTCTs (e.g. hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, prolotherapy), but they have achieved controversial effectiveness according to literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】We have decided to treat the PTRCT of our patient with type I collagen injections on the base of (i) the positive effect proved by injectable collagen on the tendon structure of cultured tenocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; (ii) the good results achieved by collagen patches implanted arthroscopically in the treatment of large and massive RC tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and (iii) the promising outcomes of collagen injections in the treatment of epicondylitis and SSP tendinopathy without tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Studies of degenerative tendons have found a small but significant decrease in the total collagen content and an increased proportion of collagen type III relative to collagen type I. The increase in the collagen type III to collagen type I ratio was consistent with smaller, less organized and weaker tendons.\n\n【27】This case report has one main limitation: the patient was not previously treated with other injective therapies; so, we cannot state that the positive effect on the PTRCT is certainly due to type I porcine collagen only. It is well known indeed that tendon needling is able to disrupt the chronic degenerative process of tendinopathies favouring localized bleeding and fibroblastic proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, no data exist on the benefits of tendon needling as a stand-alone treatment for tendon tears.\n\n【28】In conclusion, the tear healing, the improvement in the tendon structure, the clinical and functional positive outcomes and the absence of side effects allow us to propose collagen injections as a valid option for the treatment of PTRCTs. A regenerative effect of collagen injections on tendon structure may be assumed to account the results achieved. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>An informed patient consent has been completed and it is held by the treating institution.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bruno Corrado.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. It is rare as a primary splenic involvement and is usually reported as a second malignancy after hairy cell leukemia. Here, we report the first case that describes the occurrence of primary splenic T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma in a patient with a previous diagnosis of recurrent hairy cell leukemia. A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia in 1996 and achieved complete remission with Pentostatin. Then, recurrence of hairy cell leukemia was diagnosed in 2015 and treated with Cladribine. In 2016, he presented with B symptoms and hypersplenism. Therapeutic and diagnostic splenectomy was performed. Histopathological study with immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed the presence of T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, second malignancies should be considered in patients with a previous neoplasm when symptoms recur or develop.\n\n【2】BACKGROUND\n----------\n\n【3】Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic, low-grade malignant lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. It is characterized by the accumulation of small, mature B-cells with abundant cytoplasm and hair-like cytoplasmic projections, with or without histiocytes within peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver and splenic red pulp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. The incidence of second malignancies has increased in patients with hairy cell leukemia, either due to the disease itself or secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of the therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a high-grade, morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It constitutes 2–3% of all B-cell lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. The primary occurrence of this subtype in the spleen is scarce. However, up to our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the development of primary splenic THRLBCL in a patient who was previously diagnosed with recurrent HCL.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in 1996 following symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections and easy bruising. Complete remission was achieved with Pentostatin. In 2015, he developed malaise, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow (75%), with focal infiltration by groups of large cells with clear eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei with perinuclear halos contain variable chromatin, and rare mitosis figures without prominent nucleoli were observed. There was a moderate increase in reticulin fibers . A mouse monoclonal IgG1 κ Hairy for the Dako immunohistochemistry was used. Bone marrow immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD20 and hairy cell antibodies \\[Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)\\] on large cells . Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was negative. The histopathological picture and immunohistochemistry findings confirmed the relapse of HCL. We achieved complete remission with Cladribine. The patient continued to do well until June 2016, when he was admitted to our hospital with a history of B-symptoms. Vital signs were within normal range. Clinical examination revealed grade I in-depth and II in-extension lower limbs with edema and a palpable spleen, 12 cm below the costal edge. The patient could not afford the high cost of flow cytometry, so we used antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The bone marrow biopsy sections reveal infiltration by a group of large cells contains clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear halo (arrow head).

In addition, we found no plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, which excludes the blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia. An abdominal ultrasound showed a massive homogenous splenomegaly (26 × 16) cm. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral blood smear exhibited some anisocytosis with a few tear-shaped red cells and a significant decrease in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelet counts. Echocardiography exposed preserved Ejection Fraction (EF) and mild regurgitation in the mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves with no significant gradient. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray (CXR) were within normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed homogenous splenomegaly (26.3× 16) cm, without other abnormalities. We transferred the patient to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic splenectomy due to suspicion of hypersplenism and without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【9】Gross examination showed massive splenomegaly . The spleen was cut into two segments measuring (24× 9× 8) cm and (22× 9× 8.5) cm . Microscopic examination using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) revealed splenic tissue infiltrated by monoclonal, large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei . Immunohistochemistry evaluation results were positive for CD20 on large cells , CD3 on some of the background small lymphocytes , CD15  and CD45. However, it was negative for CD30 and hairy cell staining. To exclude the possibility of blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia, we performed additional staining for Annexin A1 , TRAP  and CD103  in a private histology laboratory, which all became negative. Staining for CD22 and CD25 was not available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103. These results confirmed the diagnosis of T-cell rich B cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematology-oncology department to receive chemotherapy. The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP. The patient had an uneventful follow-up until Feb 2021, when we lost the follow-up with him for unknown reasons.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|A) gross examination reveals a huge splenomegaly.

HCL typically occurs in middle-aged men presenting with pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Morphologically, it is characterized by typical hairy cells with irregular, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cytoplasmic projections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–10 \\]</u>. HCL, hairy cell leukemia—variant (HCL-v) and splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma may have cytoplasmic projections. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate HCL from other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. HCL expresses TRAP and stains positive for annexin A1, cyclin D1, CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123. HCL also negatively stains CD5, CD23 and CD10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Although HCL-v could be TRAP-positive, CD25, cyclin D1 and annexin A1 are characteristically absent. Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (previously diagnosed as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes) lacks annexin A1, CD5, CD25, CD103 and CD11c 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. To exclude the blastic transformation of HCL in our case, we performed staining Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103, which all became negative. However, staining for CD22 and CD25 was not\n\n【18】available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103.\n\n【19】T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell Lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a new clinicopathological entity. It was first described in 1988. It constitutes almost 0.1% of all lymphomas. It is rare to encounter THRLBCL as a primary lymphoma in the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The WHO classification of lymphomas included THRLBCL as a specific histologic subtype of DLBCL; and reserved its diagnosis for cases in which the large B-cell component accounts for 10% or less of tumor cells, surrounded by a majority population of small polyclonal T cells, with or without histiocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The available knowledge about THRLBCL is scarce and mainly derived from published cases and case series. This subtype often has aggressive clinical behavior. Therefore, patients often present in advanced stages with splenomegaly and bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemical staining for B-cells is always positive for CD20 and CD45, whereas there is a rarity of the positivity of CD30. More than 50% of cases are positive for BCL-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The occurrence of a second malignancy with HCL synchronously or subsequently has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The most extensive study on this topic reported second cancer among 3104 patients with HCL and concluded that patients with HCL are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia and thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Many theories were suggested to explain this phenomenon, the shared genetic predisposition, environmental exposure to carcinogens and immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Pentostatin or cladribine remains the standard first-line treatment of HCL and could achieve cure rates of 70–90%. However, a complete cure with purine analog therapy is uncertain as patients are still at risk for relapse after an average of 15–16 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. On the other hand, Rituximab therapy showed cure rates of 10–54%, while a combination of purine analog and Rituximab could achieve cure rates of 88–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 14 \\]</u>. However, the latter is associated with increased immunosuppression, toxicities and second malignancies from purine analogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 13 \\]</u>. Moreover, the splenectomy could worsen immunity and allow for mutations and subsequent transformation of HCL into a more severe neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The patient, in this case, has undergone diagnostic/therapeutic splenectomy due to splenic recurrence of HCL. Splenectomy is a well-described part of HCL treatment that helps to enhance hematologic parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Surprisingly, the biopsy revealed the presence of THRLBCL as the malignancy in the spleen. Moreover, the flow cytometry came TRAP negative and HCL staining negative. However, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether the presence of TRCBCL was a coincidence or whether there is a causal relationship between the two malignancies. In our case, we rely on the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103 to exclude the blastic transformation of HCL.\n\n【22】In conclusion, hairy cell leukemia is an indolent, chronic lymphoproliferative malignancy. It is common to develop a second malignancy in this leukemia, attributed to several theories. However, THRLBCL is rare as primary splenic involvement and a second malignancy after HCL. Second malignancies should be considered, whether symptoms relapsed or new ones developed in patients who previously had neoplasm, especially HCL. However, we recommend close monitoring for early detection of possible new malignancies in HCL patients.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pathology department for helping with sample analysis.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by Damascus University.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written informed consent for publication of his clinical details and images.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HA and TA are the guarantor of this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It mostly involves the major salivary glands with highest incidence in the parotid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The minor salivary glands involvement is only about 8%, which includes the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, hypopharynx, pharynx, larynx, trachea and lacrimal glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. And among them, only 0.4% incidence in the nasal cavity has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These tumors have their peak incidence in third-sixth decade and have been observed more in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】PA in nasal cavity are often misidentified because of their high cellularity and less stromal component, contrast to those found elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.

There was no history of excessive sneezing, nose trauma, prior surgery, weight loss, fever or facial pain. She was non-smoker, did not drink alcohol and denied any history of substance abuse. On anterior Rhinoscopy examination, there was pinkish polypoidal, non-tender nasal mass in the left nasal cavity. The probe could be passed around the mass except in its medial aspect, where it was attached to the septum. Mild bleeding on probing was seen. Neck lymph nodes were impalpable. All cranial nerve examination was also normal.\n\n【7】With clinical diagnosis of bleeding granuloma endoscopic excisional biopsy was done under general anesthesia.

The tumor cells were arranged predominantly in sheets, focally in tubules and trabeculae with an overlying intact respiratory lining epithelium . The tumor cells lining the tubules in the abluminal layer exhibit myoepithelial differentiation with plasmacytoid, spindled as well as epithelioid morphology and were relatively monomorphic. Most of these tubules contain eosinophilic acellular secretions in their lumen. Multiple areas of myxoid matrix are identified with the myoepithelial cells seen to be melting in the myxoid stroma .

There was no sign of recurrence at sixth month of follow-up.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Intranasal PA, a rare finding, was first reported back in 1929 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Though unusual, 40 case studies of nasal cavity PA by Compagno and Wong 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> and 59 cases by Wakami 通用删除7(英):<u>(1996)</u> have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Literature review of 101 cases of sinonasal PA by Rha et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> showed the incidence more common in females. Most common site of origin of nasal PA was septum (57.42%) with one-sided nasal blockage as the most common presenting symptom followed by epistaxis, mass in the nose, external swelling, epiphora and mucopurulent rhinorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Diagnosis of nasal cavity PA is confirmed by histopathological examination. Histologically, PA comprises of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in stromal matrix. However, in PA of nasal cavity, myoepithelial cellularity is unusually increased, which makes diagnosis difficult sometimes as revealed by Compagno and Wong 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> as well as Shih-Hung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A misdiagnosed case of nasal PA as adenoid cystic carcinoma was reported by Haberman and Stanely 通用删除7(英):<u>(1989)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging helps in locating the tumor rather than diagnosing.\n\n【15】Although benign, it can have local recurrences. The mesenchymal component myxoid stroma could be locus for future recurrence if it gets spilled into the surgical field 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Occasionally, it can behave like malignant tumor. About, 2.5–10% malignant change over rate with female majority was reported by Compango et al. reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Wide local resection with histological clear margin is generally performed for intranasal pleomorphic adenoma to reduce the rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Different surgical approaches like intranasal endoscopic, transnasal endoscopic, lateral rhinotomy, external rhinoplasty and mid-facial degloving can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusion, nasal PA is not only rare tumor, but also difficult to diagnose. PA has high myoepithelial cellularity with less stromal matrix. In case of chronic unilateral nasal blockage due to mass, PA should be considered as a differential diagnosis. The recurrences of PA over a duration of 7–25 years after primary surgery have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, long-term follow-up is necessary as it gives an idea of extent of recurrence, if any, or malignant change over as well as the feasibility of treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge ENT department staffs who participated in the care of this case.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed for this case report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors obtained written informed consent from the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Gyan Raj Aryal.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A Leadless pacemaker, Micra-transcatheter pacing system (Micra-TPS) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), was implanted through the right femoral vein. The pacemaker had a poor threshold after the first deployment and was retrieved. It was redeployed, and a good threshold was achieved. Afterward, her systolic blood pressure decreased from 180 mmHg (at the time of admission) to 70 mmHg, resulting in cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion, which was suggestive of cardiac injury and cardiac tamponade. She underwent emergency pericardial drainage and 300 ml of bloody pericardial fluid was drained, after which she recovered from shock. However, due to persistent drainage of bloody pericardial fluid, we performed an emergency thoracotomy. We found a full-thickness traumatic myocardial injury measuring ~10 mm on the anterior surface of the right ventricle . The damaged part was not at the site where the Micra pacemaker was implanted, but the damage had occurred during the initial deployment.

This is an important, life-threatening complication of Micra-TPS implantation. Therefore, surgical implantation of a Micra-TPS should be done with caution.

Compared with platinum-based chemotherapy, EGFR-TKIs sometimes lead to significant tumor regression. There have been a few reports of organ perforation, such as pneumothorax, gastric 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and duodenal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> perforations, caused by tumor regression after EGFR-TKI treatment. However, there are no reports of diaphragmatic perforation and secondary hernia.

A year earlier, she was diagnosed with stage IIB (cT1bN1M0) lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion, which was treated with surgery. During the surgery, unexpected tumor metastases on the pleura and left diaphragm were detected , and the surgery was suspended. Soon after, afatinib was administrated as first-line therapy. After 6 months, a complete response of the tumor was achieved.\n\n【9】The patient visited the emergency department with nausea. There was no abnormality on physical examination or abdominal radiography. Infectious colitis or an adverse drug reaction related to the EGFR-TKI was suspected; she underwent intravenous rehydration therapy, which improved her symptoms, and she walked back home. The next day, she presented again with nausea and was admitted to the hospital. Her vital signs were in the normal range. There were no abnormal findings on physical examination and no abdominal pain. Other than a slightly increased white blood cell count (9800/μl), laboratory examinations were normal. Two days after admission, her nausea worsened and we performed chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). The left diaphragm was elevated according to the chest X-ray , and chest CT revealed a DH . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an abnormal color change in a gastric mucosal lesion . We suspected a strangulated hernia with gastric incarceration and performed urgent laparoscopic surgery. Although the gastric mucosa had turned dark red , the color recovered soon after repair of the hernia, and no organ resection was necessary. We observed a defect in the diaphragm  where we had previously detected diaphragmatic metastasis. The hole was sutured, and 1 month after the surgery, we confirmed that her gastric mucosal color had improved .\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Pleural spread in NSCLC is reported in 8–15% patients on baseline imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In addition, 3.7% of patients undergoing surgical treatment have detectable pleural dissemination during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Thin-slice CT has a sensitivity of 33–87.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>, and positron emission tomography/CT often reports false-negative results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, we could not detect pleural dissemination before surgery. Figure 3A shows pleural dissemination detected during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We found a defect at the same site during treatment of the DH by laparoscopy . We suspect that tumor regression caused by the EGFR-TKI resulted in diaphragmatic perforation, and the pressure difference between the thoracic and abdominal cavities resulted in the DH. The intrathoracic pressure is reported to be ~100 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O lower than the intra-abdominal pressure during maximal inspiratory effort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In addition, vomiting increases intra-abdominal pressure, which may also have played a role in the development of the DH.\n\n【12】DH is caused by congenital or acquired defects in the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Acquired DH is rare and can go unnoticed during the immediate phase without obvious symptoms; this diagnostic delay leads to an overall mortality rate of up to 31% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Since DH does not recover spontaneously, incarcerated organs lead to necrosis and perforation. Therefore, urgent surgery is necessary once a diagnosis of DH is made.\n\n【13】In conclusion, although EGFR-TKIs often cause gastrointestinal symptoms, we should consider the rare possibility of DH in lung cancer patients with potential metastasis to the diaphragm.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors participated in the preparation and writing of the manuscript.

On the 15th-postoperative day, the echocardiography showed a left ventricle with no regional motion abnormalities, a dramatically improved ejection fraction of 55% ( Supplementary Video 2 ), normal troponin levels and the electrocardiogram no longer presented LBBB . The pathology report described a pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score (PASS) of seven, which rendered the tumor as biologically aggressive. Furthermore, one out of seven resected lymph nodes had similar tumor cells, thus the tumor was staged as pT3N1 (TNM). At the 1-month follow up, the patient had normal blood pressure values (120/75 mmHg) and preserved LVEF (55%).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Ventriculogram showing left ventricular „ballooning”—midventricular akinesia ( **A** ) Telesystolic and ( **B** ) Teledyastolic; ( **C** ) Coronary angiography showing right coronary artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis; ( **D** ) Coronary angiography showing left main, left descending artery and circumflex artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Electrocardiogram ( **A** ) Before the surgery; ( **B** ) Immediately after the surgery; ( **C** ) on the 15th-postoperative day.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】We present the case of a patient with no history of systolic dysfunction who developed Takotsubo syndrome (TS) after the surgical removal of a pheochromocytoma, which raised complex issues regarding diagnosis and treatment. Pheochromocytomas are rare, catecholamine secreting tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An even rarer occurrence is the coexistence of pheochromocytoma and TS, probably due to catecholamine excess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The patient was monitored closely by the anesthesia care team and drugs which could promote catecholamine release were avoided. During the surgery, as the patient became hemodynamically unstable, the differential diagnosis consisted of acute coronary syndrome, hypovolemic shock and anesthesia induced hypotension. Because the condition manifested as acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock and electrocardiographic changes, coronary artery disease had to be ruled out. The patient’s recent history showed no indication of a viral infection, no inflammatory markers present and no pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Following the diagnostic algorithm of TS, the patient started with an InterTAK Score of low/intermediate probability, the coronary angiography showed no coronary lesions, he had no red flags of acute myocarditis and after 15 days he had no wall motion abnormalities, which leads to the diagnosis of TS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Sympathetic activation has a central role in the pathophysiology of TS, with high levels of circulating catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Therefore, the management of the patient was based on inotropic and vasopressors agents, while attempting to avoid any adrenergic agonists, as they could aggravate the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. When the patient became hemodynamically unstable, he was treated at first with dobutamine and noradrenaline. Then, he was started on levosimendane and vasopressin. But, as the blood pressure could not be elevated, he also received noradrenaline. Gathering all the arguments, we conclude that this case was a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, a transient systolic dysfunction associated with the surgical stress of the removal of a catecholamine secreting tumor.\n\n【15】TS is a complex pathology, frequently associated with an excess of catecholamines, which requires careful consideration regarding diagnosis and treatment. We regard this case as a suddenly acquired, reversible systolic dysfunction associated with the perioperative surgical stress of the removal of a pheochromocytoma.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Irina Tudose, Dr Vlad Mageriu.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this work.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been obtained from the patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This favorable tumor microenvironment helps the transformed cells to undergo further mutations and clonal expansion. Case 1 was a 42-year old female with a 1-year history of a right breast fungating mass which was histologically confirmed to be matrix-producing type of MBC. Case 2 was a 47-year old female who presented with a recurrent left breast mass. Histologically, the tumor was confirmed to be carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. MBC is a rare, heterogeneous tumor with poor prognosis due to its aggressive behavior. It is more likely to mimic other benign breast conditions, therefore contributing to delay of diagnosis as it was for both of our patients herein presented.\n\n【2】metaplastic , carcinoma , breast , chondroid , poor prognosis\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Nonepithelial tumors of the breast generally are rare including benign and malignant types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) encompasses various types including those with mesenchymal-only and combined mesenchymal and epithelial components, and its prevalence is less than 1% of all breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The vast majority of the types of MBC are usually triple negative for ER, PR and HER-2 implying poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【6】### Case 1\n\n【7】A 42-year old female presented with a 1-year history of a right beast mass. The mass was fixed to the underlying tissue with ill-defined margins. Incisional biopsy was done and was reported as pleomorphic liposarcoma. Baseline chest and abdominal CT scan revealed normal lungs and intrabdominal organs. Then toilet mastectomy was done. The tumor was extensively necrotic, and it measured 14 × 9 × 11 cm. Seven lymph nodes were dissected from the axillary tail. Histologically, the tumor was composed of areas of epithelial components with almost no tubular formation , areas of mesenchymal and epithelial components separated by a thick fibrous strand  and diffuse proliferation of atypical spindle cells with marked pleomorphism and hyperchromasia . Increased cellularity, atypical nuclei with binucleation of the malignant chondrocytes  and mitotic count of 40 per 10 high power field were also seen. All the seven axillary lymph nodes and the surgical margins were free of the tumor. Pathologic TNM stage T4aN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. Immunohistochemistry staining for ER/PR and HER-2 were all negative. Cytokeratin (CK5/6) was focally positive.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of the tumor cells with almost no tubular formation (H & E stain, ×100), ( **B** ) both epithelial (blue arrow) and mesenchymal (black arrow) areas of the tumor are shown (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic spindle tumor cells with marked hyperchromasia (H & E stain, ×200) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant chondroid matrix.

The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 months after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she remained uneventful for about 6 months, then she developed pleural effusion, wasting and generally worsening of her condition and she died after being confirmed with lung metastasis which was confirmed by chest CT scan. However, cytological analysis of the pleural fluid was not done due to the debilitating condition of the patient.\n\n【10】### Case 2\n\n【11】A 47-year old female presented with a left breast mass for more than 10 years. She reported that she had had lumpectomy done 6 months ago; unfortunately, the excised lump was not sent for histological examination. The patient started experiencing pain from the same breast followed by appearance of a mass not more than 6 weeks after lumpectomy. On physical examination, the left breast was swollen with inverted nipple and ulcerated overlying skin. Baseline CT scan survey of chest and abdomen for metastasis was normal. Radical mastectomy with dissection of three palpable axillary lymph nodes was done. Grossly, the tumor measured 10.5 × 6 × 3 cm and was extensively necrotic.\n\n【12】Histologically, the tissue sections revealed a diffuse, infiltrating tumor composed of atypical spindle cells with extensive necrosis . The tumor cells had marked hyperchromasia and pleomorphism . Brisk mitotic figures  and count of approximately 50 mitoses per 10 high-power field and giant tumor cells were also seen . The conclusion was carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. Pathologic TNM staging of pT4bN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. ER, PR and HER-2 all were negative. CK5/6 was positive in areas with carcinomatous component.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of atypical spindle tumor cells (H & E stain, ×40), ( **B** ) spindle tumor cells which are hyperchromatic with marked nuclear pleomorphism (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic epithelial spindle and ovoid tumor cells and brisk mitoses (H & E stain, ×400) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant ovoid and spindle tumor cells with giant tumor cells (H & E stain, ×400).</u>\n\n【14】The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 weeks after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she became stable. Three months later, chest and abdominal CT scan was done to evaluate for possible metastasis and was found to be normal. Six months post operation, the condition of the patient is stable without metastasis or local recurrence.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】MBC is histologically classified into five subtypes including spindle cell, squamous cell, matrix-producing, carcinosarcoma and osteoblastic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The differential histological diagnoses of MBC include myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma and adenomyoepithelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The median age at presentation for patients with MBC ranges from 48 to 59 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Patients with MBC present clinically with rapidly growing masses usually greater than 2 cm, and such masses are fixed to the underlying tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Zavadil et al. reported that, over 20% of patients with MBC in their study had tumors measuring more than 3.5 cm and fixed to the underlying tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Rarely patients with MBC present with axillary lymph node metastasis, and the incidence has been reported to range from 6 to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that accurate diagnosis for MBC is low. Li et al. and Zhang et al. reported that only 11.8 and 20% of the patients in their studies had accurate diagnosis before mastectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgery is the main stay of treatment of MBC. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be used based on the stage of the disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been found to decrease both the rate of recurrence and mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Single institution retrospective studies and genomic profiling reported that MBCs are highly chemoresistant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Because of being almost triple negative and at the same time chemoresistant, MBCs have very poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one study, the 5-year overall survival for MBC compared to IDC-not specified type was 67.9% and 88.9%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The presence of benign heterologous element, absence of intervening stroma and predominating carcinomatous component are good prognostic factors, whereas the presence of sarcomatous metaplastic elements including chondroid, osteoid and intervening spindle cells along with lymph node metastasis and tumor size are poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The importance of reporting these two cases in this paper is that the two cases have shown that MBC is more likely to occur in females who are below the median age (over 50 years). Additionally, the presentation of MBC in our cases should always be considered as it was that initially, the disease was presenting as benign, which contributed to the delay of diagnosis in both cases.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】MBC carries a very poor prognosis due to its aggressive biological behavior accompanied with resistance to chemotherapy, increased chances of recurrence and metastasis.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are thankful to the radiologists and surgeons for their invaluable contribution for furnishing us with necessary information we needed in the process of writing this paper.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest to be disclosed.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was provided by the Institution Review Board of the School of Biomedical Science which is under Makerere College of health Sciences.

The syndrome frequently involves digestive system besides other visceral organs such as liver, lungs, thyroid gland, spleen and nervous system. We present a case of a 36-year-old female with Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus that involved skin and musculoskeletal system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The rare BRBNS (Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome) was first reported by Gascoyen in 1860 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is characterized by malformations in the venous system of the skin and visceral organs. These malformations could be severe enough to cause bleeding and death. The malformations inhabit the skin in 93% of cases manifesting as button-like bluish papules and the gastrointestinal tract in 76% of cases causing bleeding, iron-deficiency anaemia and further complications such as torsion and intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Symptoms can vary depending on the organ involved. Vascular lesions in the nervous system may cause infarctions and bleeding, while respiratory involvement may include hemoptysis. Only 200 cases of the same syndrome were reported so far. Cancerous lesions have not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Diagnosis is mainly clinically supported by different modalities. Depending on the patient’s presentation and suspicion, the CBC is used to look for anaemia and faecal occult blood could be used to look for bleeding digestive system lesions. Dark urine will necessitate a urine test as bladder lesions could be the cause. Other radiological diagnostics are obtained depending on the specific manifestation, and for instance, musculoskeletal complaints may indicate the need for a simple X-ray or an MRI, while gastrointestinal incidents may require a CT or an endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Histopathological findings include a vascular network of dilated tortuous blood-filled vessels, lined up with a single layer of endothelial cells, surrounded by a delicate connective tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】There is no curative treatment. Systemic steroids are used to control intestinal growth. Interferon-alpha is used to treat coagulopathies.

The papules grew gradually to form nodules and small tumours that bleed easily when exposed to trauma. Nodules also erupted on mucous membranes and the ones on the tongue and tonsils were surgically removed due to dysphagia and discomfort they caused the patient. The lesions kept appearing until the patient reached 20 years of age. In addition to the papules, the patient noticed the appearance of soft masses of different sizes under the skin, some of which was tender.\n\n【10】Physical examination of the patient revealed a pigmented brown-blue patch on the back , several pigmented papules on the palms and soles , soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue  in addition to several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the right forearm  and back  that were tender to touch and not attached to the overlying skin.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A pigmented brown-blue patch on the back (8 mm × 7 mm).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.</u>\n\n【15】The patient did not suffer from any anaemia that was due to the CBC laboratory examination.\n\n【16】Apart from the scars of previous surgical excisions, the rest of the physical examination was normal including the lymph nodes, hair and nails.\n\n【17】Additionally, the patient reported musculoskeletal complaints of bone and joint pain for which an MRI was ordered only to disclose multiple tumours occupying the muscles of the forearm .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumors on the right forearm (8 cm × 4 cm).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the back (MAX: 8 × 3, MIN: 4 × 3).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 8|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin and eosin slide took from a biopsy from an excided papule.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 9|删除段之间换行|Showing the forearm MRI.</u>\n\n【23】At the age of 6, a biopsy was performed on one of the excised lesions by a dermatologist . Histological findings described by the pathologist were large dilated vessels in the lower dermis and the subcutaneous tissue accompanied by capillary vascular dilatations in the upper dermis. These findings of a cavernous vascular tumour combined with the overall presentation consider BRBNS, also previously referred to as Bean Syndrome.\n\n【24】The patient was offered cryosurgery or electrocauterization to remove bothersome lesions as she wishes.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】To differentiate this diagnosis from similar diseases and syndromes, we compared the specifications of our case with six other entities: Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis, Familial glomangiomatosis, Maffucci syndrome, Kaposi sarcoma and Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Absent at birth and developing during the first weeks of life, the Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis is characterized by multifocal tumours up to 20 mm in size that grows rapidly and regresses spontaneously without sequela when confined only to the skin. The tumours could form in the liver, lungs or nervous system, causing symptoms of obstructive jaundice, heart and lung failure, or intracerebral haemorrhage. The mortality rate is high in untreated individuals. Only large symptomatic lesions should be excised. Histopathology reveals endothelial cell hyperplasia in a lobular form, mast cells and a prominent basement membrane. Upon regression, lipofibromatous tissue is seen with mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our patient started developing skin lesions at birth which did not regress spontaneously, so the diagnosis of Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis was unlikely.\n\n【28】While being not congenital, Familial Glomangiomatosis manifests with hard (not rubbery) dark blue papules and nodules clustered in groups with less mucosal involvement. The lesions usually start in young children and are less likely to cause symptoms. Some patients report pain episodes elicited by menstruation and pregnancy. The biopsy findings could catch the diagnosis as they show venous malformation of glomus cells surrounding irregular veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The genetic syndrome of Maffuci generally shows a manifestation at the age of 4–5 years old with cartilage tumours and vascular anomalies including spindle cell endothelial tumours. The nodules are tender and asymmetric, localized more on the distal extremities. The hemangiomas could be superficial or deep. The probability for chondrosarcoma is possible around the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient’s age on symptom onset and that she was having central lesions on her trunk and in her oral cavity did not fit the classical picture of Maffuci syndrome.\n\n【30】In contrast to our patient who had several lesions, Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber presents with one large vascular nevus, mostly on the thigh, knee or leg, with overlying lymphatic bullae that could bleed after puberty. The syndrome also has bone and connective tissue hypertrophy with varicose veins that may or may not accompany deep venous anomalies. Doppler ultrasound is used to diagnose this syndrome along with MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】The nodular type of Kaposi Sarcoma can manifest in older males as lesions mainly on lower extremities and rarely on the face or torso. The lesions can be symmetric with accompanying lymphedema. Hyperkeratotic overlying skin can be seen with a chance of malignancy in the advanced lesions. The biopsy shows bland spindle cells forming slit-like spaces occupied by red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【33】Our case represents one of the rarest vascular syndromes where only skin, mucous membranes and musculoskeletal systems were involved. The importance of the biopsy is not to be forgotten in combination with the clinical assessment being put in the picture of the whole presentation, such as the age and the progression. Patient education and life-long follow-up are essential to detect probable more dangerous manifestations which might be life-threatening such as gastrointestinal and neurological manifestations.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no acknowledgements.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding resources.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was also taken from the Faculty of Medicine at Damascus University.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ayham Badran.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Androgen secreting tumors can arise from either the ovarian sex cord/stromal cells or from the adrenal glands. Cystadenomas are relatively benign ovarian epithelial tumors that have rarely been implicated as the cause of hyperandrogenism. Histologically these tumors are classified as mucinous or serous. We present here a case of a 60-year-old postmenopausal female with symptoms of hyperandrogenism including hirsutism and virilization for one year. Labs were significant for high total testosterone levels persistently. On imaging, our patient was found to have a left adnexal cyst, which was subsequently removed and found to be of serous histology. Upon removal of the cyst, patients’ total testosterone levels normalized. Our case highlights the importance of including cystadenomas in the differentials when evaluating for tumorous causes of hyperandrogenism.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is difficult to diagnose due to the normal hormonal changes associated with aging. Rapid onset and progression of hyperandrogenism symptoms should raise concern for a possible tumorous source. Androgen secreting tumors can arise from either the adrenal glands or ovaries. Clinical manifestations include hirsutism, acne, anabolic appearance, androgenic alopecia, deepening of the voice and virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The predominant androgens found in women are testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). High testosterone levels but normal DHEA and DHEAS levels indicate an ovarian origin for the increased androgens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most androgen secreting tumors of the ovaries arise from sex cord cells (thecal/granulosa) that surround the oocyte or from stromal cells. Androgen secreting adrenal tumors are commonly carcinomas, that secrete cortisol, resulting in women presenting with Cushingoid symptoms as well. Cystadenomas, tumors arising from the ovarian epithelium, account for 60% of ovarian tumors. They are usually benign adnexal masses further classified into serous or mucinous types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Cystadenomas can secrete beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), which can possibly stimulate androgen secretion resulting in virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Very few reports have been published over time citing these benign adenomas as the cause of virilization in postmenopausal women. We present a rare case of a testosterone producing serous cystadenoma in a postmenopausal female.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old postmenopausal female, with only a past medical history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years ago due to uterine fibroids, presented to the gynecology clinic for clitoral enlargement, hirsutism, deepening of voice, decreased sexual drive and increasing abdominal circumference for 1 year. Chemistry showed Creatinine 0.90, Blood urea Nitrogen (BUN) 15, Glomerular filtration rate 70. Hepatic function panel revealed alkaline phosphatase 99, Alanine Transaminase (ALT) 19, Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 21. All unchanged from baseline labs 1 year ago. Lipid panel revealed normal cholesterol levels but an elevated LDL of 108. TSH was within normal limits. Pelvic ultrasound revealed an anechoic, nonvascular, cystic lesion measuring 10.5 × 5.9 × 6.2 cm in the left adnexa .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Sagittal view of left adnexal cyst measuring 10.5 cm × 5.9 cm × 6.2 cm on TVUS.</u>\n\n【7】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was subsequently ordered and confirmed the ultrasound findings of a cystic left adnexal mass and of importance, no adrenal mass was noted . No abnormality was noted in the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach, liver, spleen and colon were unremarkable with no evidence of obstruction or abnormal growth.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Sagittal view of left adnexal cyst (yellow arrow) on CT abdomen and pelvis.</u>\n\n【9】Initial workup for hyperandrogenism revealed a normal free testosterone level of 4.2 pg/ml but an elevated total testosterone 264.3 ng/dl level. Further workup showed DHEA-S 29.2 ug/dl, CA-125 5 U/ml, Inhibin-A 1 pg/ml; all within the normal limits. The patient was scheduled for a repeat transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in 3 months for monitoring of the left adnexal cyst. Repeat TVUS showed no change in adnexal cyst size or characteristics but persistence of the hyperandrogenism symptoms. The patient was then referred to endocrinology clinic for further evaluation. Patient endorsed similar symptoms as before in the endocrinology clinic. Baseline labs were repeated again. Chemistry revealed unchanged with normal Creatinine, BUN, Glomerular Filtration Rate-indicating kidney function (GFR) and electrolytes. CBC also remained unremarkable, with no changed in baseline hemoglobin, hematocrit or white blood cells. Hemoglobin a1c was obtained, found to be 5.8. Hepatic functional panel also remained unchanged from before, with no elevation in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase or ALT/AST. HIV and Hepatitis B workup was negative for the patient. Repeat lipid panel showed elevation in LDL 通用删除7(英):<u>(116)</u> and triglycerides 通用删除7(英):<u>(178)</u>. The initial workup for hyperandrogenism was repeated. Repeat labs showed a slight elevation of free testosterone 4.7 pg/ml with continued elevated total testosterone of 276 ng/dl. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) (41.7 IU/L) and Leutinizing Hormone (LH) (26.6 IU/L) levels were within the normal limits for postmenopausal women. Fasting 8 am cortisol level was suppressed (1.0 ug/dl). DHEA, Estradiol and DHEA-S were within normal limits again. The patient had another TVUS that showed a slight increase in the adnexal mass, now measuring 11.7 × 5.5 × 8.3 cm. After a multidisciplinary meeting, including endocrinology, gynecology and gynecology-oncology, the patient was scheduled for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgical pathology report showed a serous cystadenoma of the left ovary. Repeat total testosterone levels, post-operative, returned to normal levels with gradual resolution of symptoms.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is usually attributed to tumorous causes. Androgen secretion normally declines gradually with aging, with levels rarely higher than premenopausal women. These levels can usually cause mild hyperandrogenism symptoms, including decrease in scalp hair and presence of facial hair. Development of severe hirsutism along with symptoms of virilization (clitoromegaly, deepening of voice and male pattern baldness) usually indicate a tumorous origin of such symptoms. These tumors can arise from the adrenal gland or the ovaries. Elevation of the specific type of androgen, whether testosterone, DHEA or DHEAS helps to delineate the source. Androgen secreting adrenal tumors usually secrete cortisol and androgens simultaneously. These tumors are rare and usually carcinomatous in origin. Testosterone production from an adrenal origin is extremely rare. Zhou _et al_ . published a case report of a purely testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor with no concomitant rise in DHEA or DHEAS. Such tumors are hypothesized to arise from translocation of gonadal cells or differentiation of adrenal cells into Leydig cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ovarian epithelial tumors are predominantly benign tumors, with very few cases citing cystadenomas as the cause of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Most cases of hyperandrogenism are reported in pregnant or women of reproductive age. Goudas _et al._ published a case in 1996 of an ovarian cyst as the cause of high testosterone levels in a postpartum female 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nizam _et al._ published a case report in 2021 attributing a mucinous cystadenoma as the source of postmenopausal virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our report, postmenopausal virilization due to elevated testosterone is attributed to a cystadenoma of serous histology. Transformation of nonfunctional cystadenomas into androgen secreting tumors is not clear. High LH levels causing excessive stromal stimulation is a possible cause of such transformation, though in our case, LH levels were within normal limits. Another proposed mechanism is the stimulation of ovarian stromal cells by increased blood flow due to the large size of these tumors. Production of antibodies that mimic the effect of LH is another hypothesis. Secretion of hormones including beta-hCG is another possible mechanism that may cause these nonfunctional tumors to start producing testosterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Evaluation of a patient with signs and symptoms of excess androgen requires thorough history taking, physical examination and diagnostic workup. In our case, initial imaging showed a relatively benign appearing cystic lesion which was later found to be the source of the excess testosterone. Adrenal causes were ruled out by CT imaging and normal DHEA/DHEA-S levels. Serial monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are critical to efficient management of such cases. As shown in our case, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy proved to be beneficial and curative for our patient.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】We presented a rare case of serous cystadenoma producing testosterone in an elderly female. Prior cases reported such clinical scenario in women of reproductive age, whereas this is a rare case reported in an elderly woman. Clinicians should keep it as a differential in elderly women presenting with rapid onset hirsutism and virilization.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Julia Vargas for her guidance.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from patient to publish the case.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Amnah Khalid MD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe a 55-year-old male with no history of coronary disease, who presented with worsening substernal chest pain with exertion, and was ruled out for myocardial infarction. On left heart catheterization and subsequent computed tomography angiogram, he was determined to have a dual LAD with a long LAD emerging from the right coronary artery. Moreover, this long LAD gave collaterals to a native long diagonal that ran parallel to this vessel from the left system and was chronically occluded. The long LAD, consistent with type IV classification, traveled in the anterior intraventricular groove to supply left ventricular myocardium; the chronically occluded long left native diagonal supplying lateral walls and apex is a unique variant. It is important to be aware of these anomalies to establish correct diagnoses and determine treatment options.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Anomalies in coronary artery anatomy can be incidentally discovered during cardiac catheterization performed for other indications. Alternative high-resolution modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) angiogram or magnetic resonance angiography (sensitivity 88%, specificity 100%), can further help to delineate the course of the vessels. A rare variation described herein is an anomalous left anterior descending artery (LAD); this vessel emerges from the right coronary artery but courses between the thoracic aorta and pulmonary outflow tract while finally transcending into the anterior intraventricular sulcus (AIVS). Spindola-Franco _et al_ originally described dual LAD physiology by defining it as an early bifurcation of the LAD into two vessels or a second LAD that emerges from the right coronary artery. One vessel remains in the AIVS and does not extend to the apex and the other continues distally in the AIVS towards the apex. Although this variation is not immediately pathologic, it complicates management decisions for revascularization when disease is found.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nicotine dependence presented with worsening substernal chest pain with exertion. Initial work up showed a non-contributory electrocardiogram and troponin levels within normal limits. Patient already had a recent stress test myocardial perfusion imaging scan performed at outside hospital that was negative for ischemia or scar or high-risk features. The patient’s persistent atypical pain and risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) soon resulted in cardiac catheterization for possible acute coronary syndrome. Left heart catheterization via the right radial artery showed a large left main coronary artery that bifurcates into left circumflex artery with minimal disease and short LAD that gave a small diagonal artery which was occluded proximally . Upon engaging the right sinus of valsalva, an anomalous course was discovered. The right coronary artery was small and nondominant. The long LAD emerging from the right coronary artery gave collaterals to the previously mentioned long diagonal system on the left . Ventriculogram showed normal ejection fraction with normal intracardiac and transvalvular pressures.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Catheter engagement of the left sinus of valsalva demonstrating angiographically significant vessels left main, large left circumflex with medium size OM and lPL branches.

It was confirmed that the right coronary artery traveled in the anterior intraventricular groove to supply left ventricular myocardium, consistent with a type IV dual LAD per Spindola-Franco classification . Moreover, the normal MPI was reassuring that there was not compression involved; since that was the case, intravascular ultrasound was not performed in order to further assess this point. Cardiovascular surgery was not pursued since anomalous long LAD supply of anterior and septal regions was adequate without disease. The chronically occluded native long diagonal had adequate collateralization from the right long anomalous LAD at the apex. This was effectively single vessel disease with chronic total occlusion and negative low risk stress test on intermediate medical therapy. By appropriate use criteria for revascularization, it was determined the best option would be for further optimal medical therapy. The patient was discharged on optimal medical management including multiple antianginals: isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg, ranolazine 500 mg po bid, atenolol 25 mg po daily. High-risk percutaneous intervention of the ostial D1 would be pursued if symptoms could not be properly controlled.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Right sinus of valslava with RCA and conus branches.

A lot can go awry in this complex process resulting in a range of variations from subclinical to sudden cardiac death. Prevalence of anomalies has been described from 0.64 to 1.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, with 81% considered benign according to a 28-year study at the Cleveland Clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A dual LAD is significantly less frequent with prevalence ranging from 0.01 to 0.03% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Spindola-Franco _et al_ classified dual LAD into 4 original different types though up to 10 have since been described (Source 9): . This unique variant with long diagonal reaching the apex on the left system has not been described to the best of our knowledge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Normal type—Normal line diagram demonstrating normal coronary anatomy distribution. Normal LAD originates from the left main bifurcation and travels in the anterior interventricular groove giving rise to septal and diagonal branches. Type I—Short and long LAD originate from common LAD trunk. Short LAD courses along proximal anterior interventricular groove. Long LAD after proximal course runs along left side of the interventricular territory into the distal interventricular groove. Type II—Short and long LAD originate from common LAD trunk. Short LAD courses along proximal anterior interventricular groove. Long LAD after proximal course runs along right side of the interventricular territory into the distal interventricular groove. Type III—Short and long LAD originate from common LAD trunk. Short LAD courses along proximal anterior interventricular groove. Long LAD after proximal course gives a intra-myocardial course and then finishes in the distal interventricular groove. Type IV—Short LAD originates as branch of LMCA and Long LAD originates from the right side and is labeled in accordance to how it courses with respect to the great vessels. Type IV is prepulmonic, or in front of the pulmonary artery.</u>\n\n【14】Normal type—LAD originates from left coronary artery and travels in the anterior interventricular groove giving rise to septal and diagonal branches until it reaches the apex.\n\n【15】Type I—Most common, short and long LAD both from LAD proper, the shorter travels in AIVS terminating before apex while the longer travels on the anterior surface of the left ventricle with the distal third entering the AIVS continuing to the apex.\n\n【16】Type II—Short and long LAD as in type I, but the long LAD traveled on the anterior wall of the right ventricle; anterior surface of the left ventricle was supplied by branches of the diagonal vessel.\n\n【17】Type III—Short and long LAD as in type I, short LAD gave off branches supplying the anterior interventricular septum while long LAD had intra-myocardial course again ending in the distal interventricular groove\n\n【18】Type IV—Long LAD originates from right coronary artery, descends on AIVS giving off septal and diagonal branches, the short LAD gave rise to septal and diagonal branches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Although the case we describe here is a type IV classification, there are two notable distinctions that make this case even more unique. Firstly, the RCA was dominant in all four cases described by Spindola-Franco _et al._ which contrasts with the dominant LCA we describe here. Secondly, the long branch seen on the left of this patient did not ever course in the interventricular septum but rather parallel to it, making it more specifically a diagonal branch .\n\n【20】As illustrated in this case, dual LAD anomalies complicate intervention in patients with diseased vessels. It can be difficult to determine anomalous courses if the vessel runs through the myocardium or inter-arterially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A short LAD (i.e. Types I–III) should not be interpreted as a completely occluded vessel. To help differentiate the two one should look for an avascular area near the left coronary artery without collaterals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although not demonstrated in this case, type IV dual LAD that travels between the aorta and pulmonary trunk has been implicated in sudden cardiac death associated with physical activity in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】It is theoretically impossible for any two patients to have the same coronary artery anatomy given small septal branches or distribution of vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, there can be large variation in the typical anatomy that one would expect. Therefore, it is imperative for cardiologists to be fully aware of the wide spectrum of possibilities to correctly evaluate and intervene when necessary. Intervention may be based on appropriate use criteria for revascularization and clinical judgment utilizing knowledge of distribution of epicardial blood supply. Moreover, surgeons must be aware of the anatomy to prevent ligation of anomalous vessels or inappropriate arteriotomy placement. Although it is possible to discover anomalies on coronary angiography it may be difficult to know the origin of some vessels without a 3D image 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we report a rare coronary artery anomaly of a dual LAD.

This is a malignant neoplasm with a median life expectancy of 14 months in patients treated with radical intent. Survival is dependent on several independent and interacting prognostic factors of which advancing age is a negative factor. We present a septuagenarian with a 3.5-year survival following aggressive management. The potential to improve glioblastoma survival in an elderly population by examination of additional prognostic factors and identifying biomarkers warrants further research.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour (~20%). Median survival is ~14 months in those treated radically: surgery followed by 60 Gy radiotherapy (XRT) and concomitant and 6-month sequential Temozolomide (TMZ). This standard of care was limited to patients < 70 years due to concerns regarding prognosis from advancing age and reduced tolerance to oncological therapy. Despite several trials addressing aggressive treatment in this older population (> 65 years), median survival remain short, i.e. 4 months for best supportive care to 9 months from combined chemotherapy and short course (40 Gy) XRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. We present the case of a septuagenarian countering such odds to become a long-term glioblastoma survivor for 3.5 years (whilst being IDH-1 wildtype).\n\n【4】CASE SUMMARY\n------------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man presented to hospital in June 2014. He had mild confusion, 24 h of left leg weakness and 6 months of headache. He was an ex-smoker of 43 years and enjoyed regular exercise. His baseline Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was > 90. A contrast CT  demonstrated two lesions: 65 × 45 × 43 mm (103 378 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) irregularly contrast enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe and a smaller 25 × 20 × 08 mm (7853 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) mass inferiorly to it. Total volume was 111 231 mm <sup>3 </sup> . This caused 12 mm midline shift, hydrocephalus and midbrain compression. High-dose dexamethasone was commenced.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** – **C** ) Contrast CT at presentation (axial, coronal and sagittal) demonstrating a large right temporal lesion and peri-lesional oedema (dashed arrow), contralateral hydrocephalus (short straight arrow), causing significant mass effect, including uncal and subfalcine herniation (long straight arrow).</u>\n\n【7】On transfer to our unit 9 h later, he deteriorated from GCS 15 to GCS 7 (localizing to pain, no eye opening and no verbal response). A repeat CT revealed worsening mass effect. 1 g of Levetiracetam (LEV) was given (and continued twice daily) orally and an overnight emergency surgical resection was performed to save life. The patient took several days to recover. Histopathology revealed a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) . Molecular markers revealed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) wildtype and O通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation. Ki67-index was ~ 25%. A post-operative CT and MRI  demonstrated a 95% subtotal resection (STR), as residual enhancement persisted, making a post-operative volume of 24 × 14 mm (5277 mm <sup>3 </sup> ). He underwent radical radiotherapy (XRT) of 60GY in 30 fractions and concomitant TMZ in September 2014. This was followed by 6 months of TMZ finishing in February 2015. Radiological surveillance was 3-monthly. The patient had a good response and his KPS score was < 70%. He was independent at home in all activities of daily living.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Histology and immunohistochemistry demonstrating pleomorphic cells and nuclear atypia ( **A** ), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression ( **B** ), IDH-1 <sup>wt </sup> ( **C** ) and Ki67 proliferation ( **D** ); from left to right.

The patient underwent re-resection and a 93% STR was achieved . The post-operative histology and molecular markers remained consistent. Palliative chemotherapy with TMZ was commenced. Following his third cycle, he was readmitted in May 2017 due to a week’s history of headache and transient facial weakness. MRI showed a sizeable right-sided subdural hygroma .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|: (A–C) A surveillance contrast T1W MRI (axial, coronal and sagittal) conducted at 33 months demonstrating lesional recurrence in the right temporal lobe (arrow) and minimal mass effect prior to re-operation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|: ( **A** – **C** ) Post-operative contrast T1W MRI (axial, coronal and sagittal) showing significant lesional reduction but medial lesional enhancement (arrow) representing a STR.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|T2W MRI (axial) conducted at 36 months from original presentation demonstrating a right sided subdural collection consistent radiologically to a hygroma (arrow).</u>\n\n【14】As his symptoms spontaneously resolved and there was no neurological deficit, this was managed conservatively. TMZ was continued and repeat imaging in August demonstrated improved appearances. An MRI in December 2017 showed new contrast enhancing areas in the resection cavity indicative of disease recurrence. He was switched to procarbazine and lomustine for 6 weeks. In March 2018 following his second cycle, and his KPS deteriorating to < 50, his treatment was stopped and supportive care instituted as a strategy due to further disease progression on MRI and worsening side effects of chemotherapy. The patient died on May 2018: 3 years and 11 months from initial diagnosis.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】The incidence of glioblastoma is rising 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. About 3–5% of long-term survivors (> 24 months) have a mean age of ~ 37 years. This is rare in advancing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Almost all studies demonstrate a negative correlation between increasing age and survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients > 65 years are considered higher risk for poorer outcomes due to poorer physiological reserve, therapy resistance and neurocognitive function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> irrespective of other prognostic factors, e.g. molecular markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, outliers do exist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Consequently, long-term survival is probably multifactorial.\n\n【17】Our patient had an STR. A gross total resection (no demonstrable contrast-enhancing residual tumour) is a positive prognostic marker in overall survival (OS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, OS is strongly dependent on adjuvant chemotherapy. The decision to offer such treatment is dependent on patient, imaging and surgical characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. A poor performance status (PS) is an independent risk factor for mortality 12-month following treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Our patient had a good PS until palliation. Therefore, assessment of patients should not centre on identifying advantageous molecular targets in isolation to broader clinical parameters. Scoring systems calculating co-morbidity and predicting mortality do exist, e.g. Cumulative Illness Rating Scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Regardless of age, it is imperative to identify patients who have an actual capacity to benefit from treatment.\n\n【18】The landmark Stupp protocol established the standard of care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It ironically excluded patients > 70 years. Recent studies demonstrate that O通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation combined to TMZ and short-course XRT improved survival compared with short-course XRT in older patients (suggesting aggressive treatment can be tolerated) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Our patient had MGMT methylation. MGMT encoded DNA-repair proteins remove alkylating agents causing chemotherapy resistance. Methylation results in transcriptional silencing increasing OS from TMZ and XRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. MGMT methylated GBMs are localized more to frontal lobes conferring a better prognostic outlook 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ironically, our patient had a temporal tumour. It is hypothesized that LEV in conjunction to TMZ could result in increased OS compared with TMZ alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> It enhances MGMT silencing. Our patient was on LEV.\n\n【19】Overall, a single biomarker is unlikely to correlate to a meaningful clinical response in all patients. The complex molecular cascade requiring activation to enable an anti-neoplastic response coupled to the molecular complexity of glioblastoma dictates this. Clearly, our patient demonstrated advantageous biology to endure two craniotomies and adjuvant oncology treatments. This highlights a need for individualized care.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【21】We demonstrate that older age does not exclude long-term survival of glioblastoma. With an aging population, it is ever more critical to individualize patient care in a holistic fashion.\n\n【22】CONFLICTING OF INTEREST\n-----------------------\n\n【23】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】This has patient consent.

Alcohol has been established to affect the autonomic function through liver injury and accumulation of vasodilators. Alcohol can induce peripheral neurological diseases as well. This case report describes a patient who had a chronic history of alcoholism and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus presenting for orthostatic hypotension and peripheral neuropathy without underlying liver disease or other endocrinopathies. Although diabetes mellitus was controlled pharmacologically and risk factors for orthostatic hypotension were managed conservatively, his symptoms did not improve which indicated an alcohol-related autonomic dysfunction, shedding light on one of long-term complications of alcoholism.\n\n【2】dysautonomia , neuropathy , alcohol\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】The autonomic nervous system, a division of the peripheral nervous system, coordinates the function of internal organs. It is made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. They are largely responsible for the involuntary, subconscious controls of viscera, smooth muscle and secretory glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Autonomic dysfunction or dysautonomia is a neuropathy affecting the autonomic nervous system. The effect of alcoholism on autonomic function tests have been well established through the mechanism of liver injury. In this case report, we describe a 36-year-old patient, who struggled with alcoholism, and presented with multiple episodes of orthostatic hypotension found to be a sign of autonomic dysfunction exacerbated by alcoholism. Despite treatment and control of the risk factors, the autonomic dysfunction persisted upon a long period of follow-up.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 36-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 3-week history of multiple episodes of dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision and tinnitus after standing up. He also reported an episode of near-syncope with trauma to the head 1 day prior to presentation.\n\n【7】The aforementioned presentation was his third in a period of 3 weeks. He endorsed a 40 kg unintentional weight loss in the past 2 years. He had increased sleep, muscle and bone pains, tingling and numbness of his fingers and in his lower extremities distally to his knees.\n\n【8】Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in January 2017 with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.9% which increased to 10.5% in December 2018 few months before presentation. His diabetes mellitus was being treated with Metformin which he was not compliant with. He also had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated with Gabapentin, right cerebellar gliosis 2/2 to right frontal ventriculostomy along with a history of depression and alcoholism (reports drinking 10 beers per day for 2 years. Each beer is 24 oz. He quit 3 weeks prior to presentation). He did not report any intake of antidepressant therapy or sedatives.\n\n【9】He is a thin, pale man of Asian descent. There were no signs of dehydration such as dry mouth, lips and eyes. Orthostatic blood pressures: 148/97 mm Hg while sitting and 93/64 mm Hg upon standing. Generally normal body and neurological exams. Neurologic exam was normal. Tilt table test was not performed because the hospital does not have the specific facility for the test. Pertinent initial laboratory findings were: HbA1c 10.2%, AST 87 mg/dL and normal ALT. An EKG showed long QT segment with QTc = 0.53 s.\n\n【10】He was admitted for further work-up of dizziness. Twenty-four hour telemetry were unremarkable. No cardiac echocardiography was performed. No dehydration was suspected due to normal laboratory work-up.\n\n【11】During hospitalization, he was evaluated by an endocrinologist and extensive laboratory studies including PTH, 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin B12, Free T4, ACTH, Cortisol, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin and IGF-1 levels all returned normal. Serum aldosterone and renin levels were normal excluding adrenal insufficiency as a cause for orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【12】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to rule out any liver injury secondary to alcohol use was normal. A CT brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial injury. A right cerebellar gliosis was evident along with prior right frontal ventriculostomy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild gliosis in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere underlying a right occipital craniectomy and a mild right frontal gliosis along a prior shunt tract .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|T2 weighted MRI axial image showing right cerebellar gliosis related to a previous surgery.</u>\n\n【14】He worked regularly with physical therapy and was taught posture stabilizing exercises, which improved his functional capacity and ambulatory abilities. He was diagnosed with dysautonomia secondary to alcoholism. His blood pressure improved to 130–140/70–80 mmHg with no significant drop on lying/standing measurements. He was discharged on midodrine 10 mg thrice daily, gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily and thiamine 100 mg daily.\n\n【15】In a 6-month follow-up visit, his HbA1c decreased to 6.5% being on insulin therapy. He denied any further alcohol intake. Although he was compliant to his medications, and was following instructions for management of his varicose veins, he still had intermittent episodes of orthostatic hypotension with blood pressure dropping occasionally to 100/50–60 mmHg. However, he did not report any further near-syncope episode. A gastrointestinal evaluation was scheduled because of significant weight loss.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Alcohol and its metabolites can increase the concentration of vasodilators such as nitric-oxide activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and increasing plasma levels of the vasoconstrictor–angiotensin II at higher doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This will in return increase the sympathetic activity causing an increase in stroke volume as well as cardiac output due to sympathetic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Montforte _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> studied 107 patients who struggled with alcoholism versus 61 control subjects to assess the functions of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems in patients. They found that 26 patients (24.3%) had autonomic neuropathy and 34 (32%) had peripheral neuropathy. They concluded that autonomic and peripheral neuropathies are common among patients with alcoholism, and that alcohol is toxic to both autonomic and peripheral nerves in a dose-dependent manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This is the mechanism that we believe explains our patient’s symptoms as he was consuming over 240 ounces of beer daily for many years. Another study by Matikainen _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> was performed on 28 male patients with alcoholism revealing significant polyneuropathy with neurophysiological findings in 7% of subjects. A delay in parasympathetic parameters could be detected in the alcoholics compared with controls.\n\n【19】The most common neuropathy that leads to autonomic dysfunction is diabetes mellitus. However, alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy (ALN) is another important etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Uncontrolled diabetes and alcoholism are both present in our patient. In recent studies, failure of thiamine treatment to reverse ALN, together with new information demonstrating clinical and electrophysiological distinctions between ALN and nutritional deficiency neuropathies, suggests that alcohol itself may significantly predispose and enhance development of neuropathy in the appropriate clinical setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. For example, neuropathy can still develop in alcoholics on who are not thiamine deficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, subperineurial oedema is more prominent in thiamine deficient neuropathy, whereas segmental de/remyelination is more frequent in alcoholic neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient reported mild improvement in neuropathy in the follow-up visits after receiving thiamine treatment, similar to Peters _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> randomized controlled trial, and after improvement of HbA1c which leads us towards a diagnosis of ALN on top of his already established diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【20】In conclusion, alcohol metabolites can alter the endothelium leading to changes to the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems which can rarely persist for a long time despite control of risk factors.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not needed.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Verbal and written consents have been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Georges El Hasbani.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In patients with cortical hearing loss (and in the absence of communication deficit, either total or partial, as in agnosia or aphasia), some attention-related or language-based disorders may lead to a wrong diagnosis of hearing impairment. The authors present two patients (8 and 11 years old) with no anatomical damage to the ear, the absence of neurological damage or trauma, but immature cortical auditory evoked potentials. Both patients presented a clinical history of multiple diagnoses over several years. Because the most visible symptom was moderate hearing loss, the patients were recurrently referred to audiological testing, with no improvement. This report describes the use of long-latency evoked potentials to determine cases of cortical hearing loss, where hearing impairment is a consequence of underdevelopment at the central nervous system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】We report two cases of centrally related hearing loss in children (8 and 11 years old) affected by an underdeveloped maturational processing in the primary auditory cortex that is initially observable through objective and subjective hearing impairment. Traditionally, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) have been used to obtain information of the area of the brain where the auditory cortex (primary and secondary) is located 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Long-latency evoked potentials (LLEPs) are said to relate to attention, memory and auditory discrimination skills 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We believe that LLEP is a robust test that can be applied to identify cortical hearing loss associated with immature central processing.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】An 8-year-old boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective hearing loss. The boy was initially diagnosed with a probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but no language-based learning disability had been found by a preliminary psychological assessment. A pure tone audiometry (250–4000 Hz) demonstrated thresholds of 45–60 dB hearing level (HL) for the right ear and 50–60 dB HL for the left ear . Tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) as well as crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflexes were normal. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. An EEG test to discard tumor/trauma showed normal results. A well-formed brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test was recorded bilaterally . Results in the perception test (identification of two-syllable words at different HL levels) proved 100% accuracy at 50 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 35 dB HL for the left ear. He then performed an LLEP test in three sweeps (80, 60 and 40 dB normal hearing level (nHL) tone bursts at 250–2000 Hz) in the right and left ears, alternatively, which shows the absence of CAEPs for the 40 dB nHL stimulation and polyphasic interwave morphology . The patient was widely awake during the procedure with eyes open.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Audiogram and BAEP results for the 8-year-old child (on the left) and the 11-year-old child (on the right).

Cortical maturation of the older child is similar to the young boy, which recommends further neuropsychological testing.</u>\n\n【9】### Case 2\n\n【10】An 11-year-old boy presented at the Otorhinolaryngology day ward with a medical history of moderate language-based learning disorders. The boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective and subjective hearing loss. The patient had a previous pathology of bone dysplasia in the left malar. A pure tone audiometry showed normal hearing , the results of the tympanogram and TEOAE were normal and the acoustic reflexes (stapedius reflex) of the middle ear showed no anatomical disorder. Results in the perception test proved 100% accuracy at 40 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 50 dB HL for the left ear. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. Neurological history was complemented with a BAEP test, which proved normality . The LLEP test shows that waves with polyphasic morphology plus no CAEP could be identified for the 60 and 40 dB nHL stimulations . The recording of CAEPs occurs while the patient was awake with eyes open.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Recent studies increasingly use CAEPs as an early indicator of cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present the same method adapted to children to identify immature cortical development that may only be appreciated through moderate hearing loss. Patients in this report present no lesion on the temporal lobe or any other neurologically related pathology. There is no visible damage to the anatomy of the auditory system or the peripheral nervous system. They share a long clinical history and moderate language-based deficit and/or attention. We have used latency (ms) but not amplitude as the measure to classify CAEPs 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1, N1a, N1b, P2 and N2)</u>. Amplitude may not be an objective measure for the population described here because its objective value decreases with attention, so it does not seem appropriate for younger patients or patients with a suspicion of attention deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Maturational changes in CAEPs include decreases in latency and amplitude as well as dynamic morphological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We have observed that interwave amplitude decreases with stimulus intensity, which was predictable. However, polyphasic morphology (multiple periods between CAEPs) should not be present in children older than 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. This fact is so obvious that it prevents from the identification of specific CAEPs. The neural generators of P1 originate in the thalamus–cortical projections to the auditory cortex and may represent the first recurring activity in the cortex. The emergence of N1, on the other hand, has been compared with the maturation of axon neurofilaments and various critical stages in speech perception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We could assume then that both P1 and N1 reflect second-order processing of the auditory cortex. Normal values for P1 can be found ∼97 ms for 7–8 years and ∼77 ms for 11–12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, these values seem normal (78 ms) for the 8-year-old child and slightly late (89.5 ms) for the 11-year-old child. However, more clear is the emergence of double negativity represented by N1a and N1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Latencies are delayed for the rest of CAEPs. The P2 component measures were 291.5 ms in the case of the 8-year-old child and 312.65 ms for the 11-year-old child (vs. normal 150 ms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>). The N2 component is present in the two patients, with late latencies (∼400 ms for both patients). Studies have also shown that the N2 component may be used as an objective measure of temporal processing ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Normal values for N2 are 243 ms (for 8 years old) and 226 ms (for 11 years old).\n\n【14】Overall, the preliminary diagnosis of hearing impairment in these patients needs to be complemented as a case of cortical hearing loss. The case of the pre-teen is especially important because objective and subjective audiological testing discarded severe hearing impairment, yet LLEP test indicates similar late maturation when compared with the younger boy. These cases are becoming more recurring in our clinic, which advises for the use of LLEP for two reasons: first, to identify whether we are dealing with a case of cortical loss and secondly, to assess the need to complement with neuropsychological testing (in the absence of neurological trauma/pathology). In the cases reported, values of P1 (78 and 89.5 ms, respectively) were within the normal range, with double N1 component and late latencies for P2–N2 when compared with standard values (291.5 and 312.65 ms for P2, respectively, vs. normal 150 ms; ∼400 ms for N2 vs. normal 243–226 ms, respectively). CAEP amplitude was not considered, but the polyphasic morphology of the waves and the absence of some CAEPs at various intensity levels were used to demonstrate underdevelopment at the cortical area that advises for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【15】In conclusion, this case report gives evidence of two children who display some learning difficulties, as reported by caregivers and psychologists. The two children are initially diagnosed with light to moderate hearing loss by the delivery of subjective tests (pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry). However, TEOAE and immittance audiometry (stapedius reflex) proved normal for both patients. In the absence of any anatomical damage to the ear or neurological lesion/trauma as tested by CT scan and EEG, a combination of two electrophysiological tests (BAEP and LLEP) led to the final diagnosis of a centrally related hearing loss: with normal BAEP results, late latency in LLEP proved the lack of maturational central processes in both children, which coincide with psychological evidence.

Our case report shows VZV reactivation following rituximab treatment in AAV patients. The recombinant zoster vaccine should be recommended before the start of induction treatment with rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels. AAV includes microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It may present with extrarenal manifestations with or without kidney involvement. Glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab for new-onset AAV are recommended as initial therapy. Although rituximab has been used for over a decade to treat AAV, there may be infectious complications during treatment.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 78-year-old woman had myeloperoxidase AAV and used a combination of induction regimens that incorporated oral cyclophosphamide and oral glucocorticoids. Due to refractory disease, she received remission induction therapy with three courses of rituximab. However, multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome after administration of the three courses of rituximab . She was diagnosed with a herpes zoster infection. After treatment with oral valacyclovir, significant remission of the background erythema with a gradual drying out of the old vesicles was noted after 5 days of antiviral therapy .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Significant remission of background erythema with gradual drying out of old vesicles after 5 days of antiviral therapy.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Patients with AAV have higher mortality than the general population despite advances in treatment. The majority of deaths within the first year are attributed to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with respiratory infection being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Wegener’s Granulomatosis Etanercept Trial, the annual incidence of herpes zoster in AAV patients was 4.5 events per 100 patient-years, which is higher than that in the general population (0.4 events per 100 patient-years; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>).\n\n【10】Rituximab—an anti-CD20 B-cell-depleting agent—has emerged as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in AAV. A single-center observational study that included 53 patients with refractory granulomatosis, with polyangiitis treated with at least two courses of rituximab, revealed 30 infections that required antimicrobial therapy and four herpes zoster infections during the follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Another cohort study that included 64 patients with life-threatening AAV treated with a combination regimen (a treatment protocol that included rituximab, low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, low-dose oral glucocorticoids and plasma exchange) revealed four herpes zoster infections during the 3-year follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A French multicenter retrospective study that included 98 adult patients with glomerular disease who received rituximab between June 2000 and October 2011 revealed four cases of herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Antibodies are involved in preventing herpes zoster reactivation. Their functional mechanisms include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, inhibition of cell-to-cell transmission and neutralization of the cell-free virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. After treatment with rituximab alone, the duration of B-cell depletion is ~6–9 months and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia may develop in a subset of adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Because the risk for herpes zoster is increased in patients with AAV following rituximab treatment, we should be aware of primary prophylaxis among these patients. Some experts have suggested zoster vaccination for patients aged 50 years or older who are receiving rituximab for non-malignant immune-mediated hematologic disorders. Recombinant zoster vaccine is preferred over zoster vaccine live 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, for live attenuated vaccine should be administered at least 4 weeks before immunosuppressive therapy, it limits the use for AAV, especially in the emergency setting.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to express my appreciation to Dr Wei-Hung Lin for his valuable suggestions during the development of this research and for comments that greatly improved the manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Wei-Hung Lin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

He was on formula since the age of 5 months. He was not taking any medications. His blood pressure was 90/53 mmHg, with a heart rate of 130/min and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. He had normal growth (weight 6.1 kg, length 68 cm) with a normal physical examination except pallor.

However, generally, most patients with sepsis from rural area initially visit the emergency department at a rural hospital and are managed in general medical wards in Japan. Here we report on an 81-year-old Japanese female manifesting septic shock caused by the upper urinary tract infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing _Escherichia coli_ secondary to the left ureter obstruction by the urothelial carcinoma. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Although critical for the source control of infection, drainage of the ureteropelvic junction could not be performed immediately because of catecholamine-resistant hypotension. Hence, we administered polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion, followed by low-dose hydrocortisone administration. After 8 hours of infusion, she recovered from the septic shock and successfully underwent emergency percutaneous nephrostomy. This presented strategy may provide a new resolution of catecholamine-resistant patients in urosepsis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Urosepsis caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) accounts for 20%–30% of sepsis cases, and uroseptic shock is a disease with high mortality, mainly caused by obstructive uropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is a device that purifies blood by neutralizing circulating endotoxins, thereby inhibiting the progression of the septic cascade mediated by lipopolysaccharide, a core lipid portion of the gram-negative bacterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Studies have demonstrated that PMX-DHP reduces hospital mortality and the length of intensive care unit stay in patients with acute-phase septic shock control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the long term effect of PMX-DHP on survival rate has been insignificant in the ABDOMIX and EUPHRATES studies, despite an improvement in mean arterial pressure elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Glucocorticoids increase the sensitivity of alpha- and beta-adrenaline receptors. An adjunctive low-dose steroid has been reported to significantly shorten the time to recover from septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Various effects of glucocorticoids, including immune-modulating properties through interaction with NF-κB and elevation of blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenesis in the liver and peripheral tissues, are favorable against septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In Furano city, a rural area in the northern part of Japan, there are no facilities such as helicopters to transfer patients to an intensive care unit of an urban hospital after sunset. Such patients need to be treated with available medical resources. In this case report, we present a case of uroseptic shock caused by the obstructive pyelonephritis, that was successfully treated at a rural hospital with a combination of PMX and a low-dose steroid.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 81-year-old Japanese woman with twice histories of UTI presented to our emergency department with fever, anorexia and immobility around 4 pm. Her initial physical findings presented clear consciousness, body temperature of 37.5°C that continued since 3 days ago, upper extremity blood pressure (BP) of 68/36 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm with irregular rhythm, respiratory rate of 24 cycles per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% with 6 L/min of 100% oxygen administration via a Venturi mask. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left costovertebral angle. The urine was white and cloudy in appearance and the leukocyte esterase test was positive. Microscopic examination revealed more than 50/hpf of white blood cells (WBC). Blood test revealed significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers, such as WBC, 27.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/μl with 93.8% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; blood urea nitrogen, 31.2 of mg/dl; creatinine, 2.7 mg/dl; C-reactive protein, 26.7 mg/dl; glucose, 70 mg/dl; lactate, 3.3 m mol/L; and endotoxins, 2000 pg/ml. The arterial blood gas test revealed a pH of 7.39, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 33 mm Hg, and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 80.9 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Noncontrast computed tomography imaging revealed a left ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction by a mass containing low-density fluid, which was diagnosed as an abscess by the radiologist . She was diagnosed with uroseptic shock secondary to the obstructive pyelonephritis with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 3 points.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography image of percutaneous nephrostomy.

Thus, the initial source control by percutaneous nephrostomy was not performed due to the hypotension. To further account for hypotension and sepsis simultaneously, PMX-DHP was initiated and intravenous hydrocortisone of 240 mg was administered. The BP, HR and mean arterial pressure recovered to 125/80 mm Hg, 95 mm Hg and 80 bpm, respectively, in 8 hours. Then, the percutaneous nephrostomy was performed and the abscess at the UPJ was successfully drained . Urine and blood culture results reported on Day 4 revealed the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ and therefore, the initial treatment of carbapenem was continued. The patient completely recovered in 2 weeks. She finally underwent total left nephroureterectomy on Day 65 with uneventful recovery.

Treatment of urosepsis associated with obstruction and abscesses requires drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Physiological changes may occur due to the prone position maintained during the drainage, such as increased intraperitoneal pressure and reduced venous return, which can potentially induce complications such as hypotension, arrhythmia, and syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Accordingly, optimal BP must be maintained before such a procedure. In our case, UPJ drainage in the prone position was too invasive with poorly controlled BP after the initiation of norepinephrine. Hence, PMX-DHP along with the administration of hydrocortisone was selected in advance to the drainage. The effect of PMX on septic shock patients with different endotoxin levels is currently being investigated in a clinical study, the results of which are expected to come in 2022 (NCT03901807). It is known that norepinephrine, which is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-adrenergic agonist effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, is the first line of treatment for septic shock hypotension; however, our patient showed catecholamine-resistant hypotension with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. The use of corticosteroids and PMX improved hypoglycemia and hypotension simultaneously before using vasopressin.\n\n【12】ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are resistant to numerous β-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Major risk factors for colonization or infection with ESBL-producing organisms are antibiotic exposure, prolonged hospital stays, and admission in an institution with high rates of third-generation cephalosporin use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In the present case, the patient had a medical history of UTI treated with cefcapene pivoxil, a third-generation cephalosporin, and it was suspected that the bacteria were already resistant to those antibiotics; thus, we chose an empirical treatment with carbapenem.\n\n【13】Limited or delayed access to proper medical care is a severe confounder of mortality in rural areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Even the critically-ill patients in rural areas reach hospital after some delay due to the distance. Furthermore, patient transfer was not an option in our case. A harmonized and efficient initial management, including correct diagnosis, vital sign control, empirical antimicrobial treatment and additional adjunctive treatment, is crucial in such cases.\n\n【14】In conclusion, we report a case of urosepsis in a rural area hospital that achieved optimal initial management, which included norepinephrine with hydrocortisone, PMX-DHP, and empirical antibiotics, ultimately resulting in good prognosis.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr Yoko Kato, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, for reviewing this case report.

Most cases reported in children were found to have unsuppressed viral loads and low CD4 counts. Although the aetiology of the disease is largely unknown, a few studies have postulated cytokine imbalance and immune activation as possible causes. Intimal staining of the involved cerebral arteries have revealed transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-gp 41. We present the case of an 18-year-old boy with congenitally acquired HIV-1 who presented with right hemiparesis at the age of 12 years and was found to have Moyamoya disease on neuroimaging. His CD4 count has always been low (<100 cells/cumm) in spite of being virally suppressed. He was started on anti-retroviral therapy at 5 and half years of age and he was continued on the same. He was treated conservatively and he continues to have residual right hemiparesis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Moyamoya disease has been seen in patients with long-standing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) now that survival has improved with good adherence to medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

We present the case of an 18-year-old adolescent with congenitally acquired HIV with moyamoya disease who first presented with a stroke at the age of 12 years.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-year-old boy with congenitally transmitted HIV-1 was diagnosed and started on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) at the age of 5 and half years with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. One month later, he was diagnosed to have abdominal tuberculosis and was given 6 months of anti-tuberculosis therapy. He also has a past history of varicella at the age of 2 and half years. His ART regime was later substituted to abacavir, lamivudine and nevirapine due to the phasing out of stavudine at the age of 9 years, and it was later changed to tenofovir, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir at 12 years due to suspected immunological failure. Lopinavir/ritonavir was later substituted to dolutegravir. He has been virally suppressed all throughout. However, his CD4 count has always been <100 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> in spite of being virally suppressed. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis has been given all throughout. No other opportunistic infections were seen.\n\n【6】At 12 years of age, he developed right hemiparesis with right-sided choreiform movements. Aspirin was started and the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal/fusiform aneurismal dilatation/ectasia predominantly along the left lateral aspect of the basilar artery just adjacent to its bifurcation, with ectasia of the origin of right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) measuring 8 × 8 × 8 mm along with aneurismal dilatation/ectasia involving the terminal left internal cerebral artery and its bifurcation measuring 6 × 6 × 6 mm, extending to involve proximal A1 and M1 segments along with paucity of M2 and M3 cortical segment vessels. Small vessel ischemic changes were also seen. Thrombotic workup was found to be normal. Renal and lower limb dopplers were normal.\n\n【7】Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) done a year later revealed ectasia of the basilar artery at the bifurcation of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) A1 segment saccular aneurysm. Both right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA) showed vasculitic changes of patchy appearance most pronounced on the left side. ART was continued along with daily aspirin and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy.\n\n【8】Repeat MRI done 5 years later revealed aneurysms at the left internal carotid artery (ICA), with bifurcation of size 5 × 5 mm, and at the basilar artery bifurcation of size 8.7 × 7.6 mm.\n\n【9】DSA repeated 6 years later revealed diffuse narrowing of both right and left supra-clinoid internal carotid arteries (ICA), with aneurysmal dilatation at the right ICA top involving the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), proximal M1 with non-visualization of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) beyond proximal M1 with distal reformation via extensive lenticulostriate collaterals giving a puff of smoke appearance suggestive of moyamoya phenomenon as seen as Fig. 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|DSA showing ( **a** ) left supraclinoid ICA and ( **b** ) right supraclinoid ICA narrowing with obliteration of the anterior carotid and middle carotid arteries and extensive lenticulostriate collateral giving a puff of smoke appearance on both sides.</u>\n\n【11】On examination, his weight was 42.45 kg and height was 160 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was 16.58 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ( _Z_ score between −2 and − 3 SD). His heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute and blood pressure was 114/80 mmHg. Old scars of varicella infection were present over the face. Cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a residual paresis on the right side with a power of Grade 5. The aspirin was discontinued and the patient continues to be on regular follow-up.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】HIV-associated vasculopathy in patients with HIV-1 disease has been found to be due to the proinflammatory state and cytokine imbalance, leading to endothelial damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Involvement of the regulatory protein Tat in cytokine dysregulation in the central nervous system has been mentioned as a possible cause along with elevated levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Immune activation in response to transendothelial migration of HIV strains coupled with HIV tropism for brain mononuclear cells has been postulated in the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Moyamoya disease should be considered in children with HIV having a stroke. The most common arteries to be affected are the ICA, followed by the MCA and ACA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient also showed involvement of both the ICAs. Medial fibrosis, intimal hypoplasia and loss of muscularis and elastic tissue are the common histopathological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Intimal staining of the involved cerebral arteries have revealed transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-gp 41, suggesting transendothelial migration of the virus and a direct effect of the virus in the pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Varicella infection and tuberculosis have been described as possible aetiologies of acute hemiplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. However, our patient did not show any clinical signs of active infection. Complications of moyamoya disease include cerebral ischemia and haemorrhage, leading to weakness, speech disorder and convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with hemiparesis on the right side with no speech abnormalities or seizures. Treatment in children is largely conservative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, revascularization surgery is being increasingly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Early initiation of ART plays a vital role in the prevention of HIV vasculopathy. Protease inhibitors have been linked to drug-induced vasculopathy. Monitoring of patients to maintain good adherence to ART, thus achieving viral suppression and good immunity, may help prevent vascular complications. Ongoing clinical monitoring to prevent rupture of the cerebral aneurysm and haemorrhage is vital in these patients.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Krishna Chidrawar, Clinical fellow—Interventional Radiology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400022.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding towards the article processing charges received from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Taken from Hospital Ethics Committee.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient’s written consent was obtained for publication.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Noella Pereira, Consultant—Paediatric HIV & Telemedicine, Paediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DETAILS OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH AUTHOR\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors were involved in patient management, preparation of manuscript and approval of the final version.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT AND INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE WORK SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022, India.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DISCLAIMERS, IF ANY\n-------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is usually part of benign illness and can occur at any age. Recurrent vomiting can be a symptom of life-threatening medical or surgical emergencies. It can be rarely caused by an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst. Early recognition is essential for preventing delays in management and potential complications.\n\n【2】Here we report a case of an extraluminal pyloric duplication presenting as progressive gastric outlet obstruction cyst in a 14-month-old Syrian boy. The diagnosis was made through abdominal ultrasound, gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography scan.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Vomiting is a common complaint in a multitude of disorders, ranging from gastrointestinal etiologies, central nervous system disease, pulmonary problems, renal disease, endocrine/metabolic disorders, and drugs (either as side effects or in overdosages) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Gastric Duplication Cysts (GDC) in particular are rare causes of pediatrics vomiting. It is accounting for 4% of gastrointestinal tract duplications or roughly 17 per 1 000 000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cystic duplication of the pylorus is scarcely reported, only 2.2% are of gastric origin.\n\n【5】To our knowledge, no more than 50 cases of pyloric duplication have been reported in the literature, most of them were extraluminal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 14-month-old Syrian boy was referred to our clinic for recurrent incoercible, non-bilious vomiting after feeding, 4-6 episodes a day, with abdominal pain and constipation for 1 month. He was born full-term, normal pregnancy without any complications after birth. His birth weight was 4 kg. The parents deny any history of medical ingestion, toxin exposure, trauma, or falls. In his medical history, the boy was diagnosed with patent duct arteriosus (PDA) that surgical ligation at the age of 12 months.\n\n【8】There was no family history of genetic disorders. On physical examination, his body weight was 11 kg (50.79%; _z_ score –1.5 SD), the length was 82 cm (87.49%; _z_ score −2.5 SD), he was vitally stable and generally well. The abdomen was soft with no masses or organomegaly. The patient underwent multiple investigations: Complete blood count (CBC), Blood gas test, Amylase, lipase, renal and liver function, electrolytes, glucose, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Urinalysis, culture, and sensitivity were within normal limits. Echocardiography was normal.\n\n【9】An ultrasound (US) of the abdomen revealed a thick-walled, round cystic mass approximately measuring 3.5 × 3.5 cm which was adherent to the posterior wall of the pylorus, and compressed the pyloric channel, resulting in partial gastric outlet obstruction. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed which showed a narrowing in the outlet of the stomach . An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed cystic mass compressing the pyloric channel . Based on the clinical presentation and radiologic findings, a pyloric duplication cyst was suspected.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed narrowing in the outlet of the stomach.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT showed cystic mass compressing the pyloric channel.</u>\n\n【12】An open laparotomy was undertaken for assessment and cyst removal. At laparotomy, a cystic mass was identified inferior and lateral to the pyloric channel which appeared to compress it, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. The cyst had no communication with the pyloric channel but it shared a muscular wall with the antimesenteric border of the pylorus.\n\n【13】The duplication was resected as well as the common wall and a pyloroplasty was performed .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|A cystic mass measuring ~35 × 35 mm.</u>\n\n【15】Histologic examination revealed gastric mucosa with a smooth muscle coat, which was consistent with a pyloric duplication cyst. No aberrant tissue was identified. The patient was discharged 7 days after surgery, with no postoperative complications. The patient was asymptomatic 4 years later.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Vomiting after feeding in a 1-year-old patient is frequently seen in gastroenteritis (GE), but GE is usually associated with diarrhea, and recurrent vomiting is not usual. The physical examination and laboratory were normal. That can be excluded the systemic infections, metabolic and endocrine causes. There was no medical history. A surgical condition such as a gastric duplication cyst usually presents at younger than one year of age, it is more prevalent in females. Only one-third of the duplications are present in the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】GDC may be associated with various other congenital anomalies like; alimentary tract duplications, genitourinary abnormalities, and an esophageal diverticulum in about 50% of cases, vertebral and spinal cord abnormalities (16–26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In our case, the patient had a corrected cardiac malformation associated with an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst which was the first case described in the literature.\n\n【20】Symptoms of pylorus duplication are non-specific that vary according to the size, site and the type of fluid secreted by their mucosa. Symptoms usually range from a nonobstructing lesion to an obstructing mass, even mimicking infantile hypertrophied pyloric stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient is male and has vomiting with good weight gain at 14-months-old.\n\n【21】The first report on the duplication cyst was by Calder in 1733. However, it was not until 1937 when William E. Ladd introduced the term duplication of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cystic Duplication of the pylorus has an embryonic origin, it probably develops in the sixth week of the embryonic period but the etiology has not been elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】GDC must be continuity of the cyst wall with the stomach and shared in blood supply. It should be no interruption between the smooth muscle layer of the doubling area and the normal intestine. The cyst should have an epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Diagnostic confirmation often requires complementary imaging tests such as US, CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The US is the most common modality used to image duplication cysts. GDC characterizes in US as a ‘double-wall sign,’ delineating the echogenic inner mucosa from the hypoechoic outer rim of muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the current case, US only made a diagnosis and showed an anechoic cystic mass with a double-wall sign.\n\n【23】Treatment of gastric duplication is complete surgical resection due to the risk of malignant transformation. Surgical resection can be performed by open and laparoscopic techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In summary, this was an unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction caused by an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst in a boy with cardiac malformation. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of using the US to diagnose gastrointestinal duplication cysts.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer, doctors in pediatrics and pediatric surgery departments, and laboratory assistants in Tishreen University Hospital laboratory.

A 60-year-old male presented with impaired consciousness and convulsions due to SAH from a ruptured aneurysm. It was managed by endovascular coiling 20 h after the onset of symptoms. Serial brain imaging for 2 weeks revealed progressive bilateral SHs, more on contralateral side of leaking aneurysm. Management of SH was discussed in a multidisciplinary setting to be conservative as there was neither significant mass effect nor hydrocephalus. The patient recovered neurologically except for mild dysarthria. The SH persisted for 2 months and then cleared gradually. We concluded that SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subdural space can be described as ‘subdural hygroma’ (SH), ‘external hydrocephalus’ and ‘subdural effusion’.

However, SH is rarely reported after endovascular coiling for ruptured aneurysms.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】The patient was a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco smoking. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute onset of headache and mild right-sided weakness. The patient had neither history of head trauma nor fever before the presentation. Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) of brain revealed extensive SAH. CT cerebral angiography revealed a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCA), 4.5 × 6 mm with neck 2–3 mm, and another internal carotid artery, para-ophthalmic, unruptured aneurysm on the right side. Hunt and Hess’s scale was 3, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14/15. The patient developed generalized tonic–clonic convulsion that was controlled by midazolam and kept on oral levetiracetam.\n\n【10】Endovascular coiling was performed 20 h after the onset of symptoms, and it was an uncomplicated technique. ICU management followed the standard protocol of SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】On the 5th day, GCS decreased to 11/15 and brain CT revealed the same degree of SAH and increased SH, but without any mass effect nor hydrocephalic changes. Transcranial Doppler to exclude cerebral vasospasm was requested but not done at that time due to technical problems.\n\n【12】No improvement was observed in the consciousness level, which deteriorated further. On the 10th day, GCS was 9/15 with worsened right-sided weakness (grade 2). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed right-sided sizable SH exerting mild mass effect and left basal ganglia ischemic focus. Multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) concluded that the patient had delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and significant SH with mild mass effect and recommended no intervention for SH.\n\n【13】At the end of the 2nd week, the consciousness level improved to GCS 11/15 and weakness was grade 3. Surprisingly, imaging revealed progressive right SH and new SH on the left side, but with no mass effect from either hygromas. Another MDM recommended continuing conservative management.\n\n【14】By the end of 1st month, the consciousness level was regained and right-sided weakness improved to grade 4 with mild dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed that SH had decreased. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center (RC) after 1 month of ICU stay.\n\n【15】Imaging after 2 months revealed that SAH was almost cleared, both SHs were still decreasing and a small left basal ganglia infarction. The patient was discharged home from RC without any residual weakness, fully conscious but with mild dysarthria.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】SAH is a serious medical condition with an increased fatality, an incidence of 9 per 100 000 and a fatality rate within 6 months of about 60%. In aneurysmal SAH, the three most important variables related to prognosis are the early neurological state, age and the degree of extravasation on imaging. Consciousness is the most important determinant for outcome after SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In 1932, Dandy described SH as a collection of nonblood fluid in the subdural space that can be encapsulated under a thin membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of SH is still unclear; however, two postulated mechanisms include a tear in the arachnoid membrane causing CSF influx or decreased intracranial pressure leading to passive effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Both external hydrocephalus and SH have unique clinical entities. External hydrocephalus is usually associated with disturbances in CSF flow caused by the imbalance between production and absorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Radiographically, external hydrocephalus and SHs are similar, but ventriculomegaly is the primary distinguishing criterion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Our case was managed by simple endovascular coiling through the femoral approach with the intervention of bleeding left PCA aneurysm (four coils were deployed), and the right one was postponed after complete patient recovery.\n\n【21】The serial imaging of our case never showed any ventriculomegaly during the course. This made it a unique case of SH post-coiling. A previous study reported a case of external hydrocephalus as it was associated with ventriculomegaly, which also complicated the course of coiling for ruptured aneurysm. However, the case remained asymptomatic and the collection resolved spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Subdural collections may be seen after clipping of ruptured aneurysmal SAH but rarely seen after coiling. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting alone is an effective and accepted procedure in post-clipping states. However, patients with subdural effusion that is not accompanied by hydrocephalus do not require subdural peritoneal shunt. When selecting the treatment for subdural effusion, it is important to consider the presence of hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The management strategies for cases of SH following aneurysmal SAH patients are still undefined. Close neurological observation is indicated to follow the progression of any mass effect or conversion into a subdural hematoma.\n\n【24】The management of our case regarding SH was challenging. The deteriorating consciousness level put more ambiguity on the clinical impact of SH due to the incidence of DCI at the same time of increasing size of SH and its mass effect. However, the absence of ventriculomegaly with a meticulous neurological assessment directed us to continue the conservative plan.\n\n【25】The etiology of the SH in the presented case is unknown as there was no history of head trauma at presentation, CSF diversion technique, nor craniotomy, which represent the potential causes for SH after SAH. Whether it is related to CSF flow dynamics post-occurrence of SAH or from a direct effect of coiling (although SH was mainly on the opposite side of bleeding aneurysm) is still to be defined.\n\n【26】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【27】SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was taken from a first-degree relative.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>W.O.A. and M.E.A.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This report presents an interesting case of this rare skin condition developing in a male patient following a diagnosis of stroke.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 87-year-old gentleman was admitted to our stroke rehabilitation unit following a right partial anterior circulation ischaemic stroke. The patient had a past medical history of hip osteoarthritis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, asthma and angina; no previous dermatological conditions were noted.\n\n【6】One month after the stroke, the patient developed a widespread maculopapular, blanching rash to the trunk and limbs. This was accompanied by petechial lesions on the dorsum of the feet. It was thought to represent a possible allergic rash and spontaneously resolved within 3 weeks.\n\n【7】A month following this episode the patient developed vesicular lesions on the palmar aspect of both hands . He then went on to develop two large bullae measuring 5 × 3 cm and 8 × 4 cm over his left foot and over the following days more bullae appeared over both feet. These were tense and most were haemorrhagic . He did not develop any blisters elsewhere and there was no mucosal involvement. Punch biopsy of a vesicle appeared to show an intra-epidermal lesion; however, the roof comprised of necrotic keratinocytes and it was commented that this could represent re-epithelialization of a sub-epidermal blister . Prominent eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate was noted in the superficial dermis, with extravasation of red blood cells. No sample for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was taken as the patient was reviewed at a peripheral site out of hours. Serum skin autoantibodies were found to be positive at a titre of >1/320 for pemphigoid and supported the clinical diagnosis of BP.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Vesicles appearing 1 month after the stroke.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Tense and haemorrhagic bullae appearing on feet.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The biopsy showed an intra-epidermal vesicle with a necrotic roof; the underlying dermis showed numerous eosinophils.</u>\n\n【11】The patient was started on an ultra-potent steroid cream (1 application once daily), emollients and long-term treatment with oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). Within a month the skin lesions resolved and the patient was able to once again participate in stroke-specific rehabilitation. Post-treatment titre was not evaluated as this is not routinely done at our institution.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】The immunopathogenesis of BP involves the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against two proteins: dystonin, also known as BP antigen 1 (BPAG1), and type XVII collagen, known also as BP antigen 2 (BPAG2), of 230 and 180 kDa, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Both are adhesion junction plaque proteins within the hemidesmosome, which anchors the basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane. When these proteins are targeted there is separation at the dermo-epidermal junction, with the formation of sub-epidermal blisters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】DBP is a clinical variant of BP distinguishing feature of which is the initial or persistent palmoplantar localization of the lesions. Bullae or vesicles can be haemorrhagic in nature, and purpuric lesions are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; as in the case described, some patients might have prodromal symptoms, mainly eczematous or papular eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis includes mainly dyshidrotic eczema, which presents with smaller and typically non-haemorrhagic vesicles, but also palmoplantar pustulosis, bullous tinea infection, scabies infection, contact dermatitis, bullous lichen planus and T-cell lymphoma. DBP is typically confirmed by skin biopsy, demonstrating sub-epidermal bullae and eosinophil infiltration, and DIF to show linear deposits of IgG along the dermo-epidermal junction. Treatment is dependant on disease severity. Topical steroids are often sufficient in mild disease and can be used in combination with oral tetracyclines as in this case. Oral steroid therapy is often required and systemic immunosuppression may be needed to wean steroid dose. Although skin lesions are not usually life-threatening, BP is associated with a 6–41% mortality at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】DBP has been associated with neurologic, psychiatric and cerebrovascular disorders. There are only three cases reported in the literature of DBP in patients with a past history of stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>; however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous case has been reported of DBP developing immediately after a cerebrovascular event. Stroke as a risk factor for developing BP has been studied in the literature. Shen _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> demonstrated with a large-scale population-based study that the hazard ratio of BP was significantly higher in stroke patients compared with the control group. The hypothesis behind this correlation is that damage to the blood‑brain barrier in stroke generates autoantibodies that cross-react with BPAG1/BPAG2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Interestingly, the inverse relationship might also be true: patients with a history of BP have a 2-fold increased risk of developing stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. BP patients seems in fact to have a dysfunctioning endothelium, as demonstrated by their higher serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the E-selectin, and this has been considered a risk factor for developing cerebrovascular events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusions, we presented a case of DBP developing after stroke. More studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between these two clinical entities. DBP should be considered in older patients presenting with blistering lesions to the hands and feet, particularly when haemorrhagic.\n\n【18】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【19】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【20】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【23】Written consent obtained.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】Authors confirm that the research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【26】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【27】Daniele Fanelli.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Despite its benign nature, RDD can cause serious hematological complications. A 14-year-old male, presented with 3-month history of hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and rash. After thorough investigation, RDD was diagnosed by mediastinal lymph node biopsy that revealed presence of S100 and CD68-positive cells with absence of CD1a confirming the diagnosis of RDD. Treatment involved combination of steroids and Rituximab, which proved to be highly effective. The patient had dramatic improvement and entered remission, with follow-up period of 2 years. It is important to note that although RDD is a rare disease, it causes severe complications, as evidenced by the patient's parameters. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. Histological diagnosis is of great value, as it helps confirming and guiding treatment decisions. With the right treatment, patients can experience great recovery and quality of life.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) has been classified as a rare nonmalignant condition marked by significant histiocyte proliferation in lymph nodes of the head and neck since its initial classification as a distinct pathological entity in 1969 as an uncommon instance of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, also known as sinus histiocytosis with extensive lymphadenopathy. RDD has a 1 in 200 000 incidence, affects more men and patients of African descent than other demographics and skin involvement is more frequent in Asian women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although the primary cause of RDD is still unknown, viral diseases such as the herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus may play a role in its development. RDD is characterized histologically by CD1a negativity, CD68 and S100 positivity. Depending on the afflicted areas, RDD may be categorized into three subtypes: nodal, extra-nodal and mixed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Herein, we present a case of a 14-year-old male who presented with rash that was later diagnosed with RDD complicated by hemolytic anemia.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 14-year-old male patient presented with a 3-month history of non-painful patches of skin hyper and hypo-pigmentations, distributed over the trunk area.\n\n【8】The patient initially sought medical advice from a dermatologist who treated him with antifungals as a case of fungal skin infection without improvement. At that time, he had no history of fever, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, hematuria or previous episodes.\n\n【9】Over the next months, he developed fatigue and exertional shortness of breath upon activity and reported occasional night sweats with undocumented weight loss. However, he didn’t seek medical advice until 3 months had elapsed, when he developed yellowish discoloration of his sclera associated with dark urine and no change in stool color.\n\n【10】On examination, patient had scleral icterus and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed hemolysis with hemoglobin levels of 5 g/dl, mean cell volume of 122.7 fL with normal folate and vitamin B12 levels, elevated reticulocyte count of 17.2%, red blood cells (RBCs) 0.79 × 106/μl, with leukocytosis and eosinophilia (25 × 103/μl and 7% respectively) and normal platelet count.\n\n【11】Anisocytosis was found on peripheral blood smear, with teardrops, microcytic hypochromic cells, schistocytes and nucleated RBCs consistent with acute hemolysis. Coombs test was significantly positive, indicating autoimmune hemolytic anemia, high lactate dehydrogenase 576 U/L and bilirubin 4 mg/dl, Direct Bilirubin 0.21 mg/dl, decreased haptoglobin levels and normal liver enzymes.\n\n【12】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 94 mm by the end of the first hour and the C-reactive protein was 19 mg/dl. Body fluids tested negative for microbiology. The viral panel was negative for Epstein–Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Brucella and toxoplasma.\n\n【13】Coagulation, autoantibodies and kidney function profiles, urinalysis, complement levels were all normal. Immunoglobulin levels were normal except for elevated IgE: 459 IU/ml. Abdominal ultrasound showed a liver span of 14.5 cm and spleen of 16 cm with otherwise normal findings.\n\n【14】Chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed enlarged lymph nodes in the perihilar regions of the lungs with hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【15】The symptoms continued with a progressive course. The patient was ill-looking, but stable vitally except for tachycardia. He was maintained on supportive care and was given packed red blood cells. A lymph node biopsy taken from the mediastinum via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery showed sinusoids filled with S100 and CD68-positive but CD1a-negative, confirming the diagnosis of RDD .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|RDD.

Immuno-stains supporting the diagnosis.</u>\n\n【17】Methylprednisolone 120 mg was given once daily for 4 days, leading to dramatic improvement in his overall status and substantial improvement in hemolytic parameters within 4 days. He was discharged on Prednisolone 40 mg daily with vitamin D, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and rituximab. Follow-up for 2 years showed no disease relapse, and no medications required.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】RDD is identified by infiltrating, pale, eosinophilic histiocytes that are S100-positive, CD68-positive and CD1a-negative. Although Rosai and Dorfman initially described this disorder in young Africans, it has been reported globally in individuals of all races. The etiology remains uncertain; nevertheless, the coexistence of autoimmune antibodies during disease activity, coupled with numerous reports providing serological evidence of recent bacterial or viral infections, particularly herpes viruses, suggests a potential association with immune dysregulation secondary to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Painless, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy is the most common presentation, with an average age of onset in the second decade. Fever, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hypergammaglobulinemia are some of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities that may be present.\n\n【21】RDD can be confused with other histiocytosis, both benign and malignant. However, the unique features of RDD, such as the presence of emperipolesis, the immunocytochemical profile and absence of cellular atypia, along with clinical and laboratory findings, can help distinguish it from other potential diagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Extra-nodal sites are involved along with lymph nodes in 43% of RDD cases. In 23% of cases isolated extra-nodal RDD occurs, with peripheral lymphadenopathy being the most frequent manifestation.\n\n【23】Extra-nodal RDD affects the skin, soft tissue, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and skeletal system. The severity of joint disease varied from mild polyarthralgia to disabling arthritis. RDD has been linked to autoimmune phenomena, with hematologic autoantibodies against red cell antigens being most commonly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】But acute life-threatening autoimmune hemolytic anemia complicating RDD is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】RDD management varies, and in some cases, like the one with our patient, steroids alone may suffice. However, in refractory cases, chemotherapeutic agents and blood transfusion may be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Multi-organ involvement and immune dysfunction are negative prognostic factors and necessitate treatment. Glucocorticoids and chemotherapy have been used with reported success in some cases where other cases had spontaneous resolution. Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine are commonly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion, early and appropriate management are crucial to achieving full recovery in RDD patients. Therefore, raising awareness of RDD among healthcare professionals is needed, leading to prompt diagnosis and appropriate management.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the patient who participated in this case report and allowed us to share their medical information.

Blood tests revealed a high C-reactive protein level (9.68 mg/dl).\n\n【2】A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a strong signal in front of the cervical vertebrae which coincided with the longus colli muscle in the short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) sequence .

We describe a case of a 74-year-old male who developed an aortic-cavitary fistulous tract as a complication of prosthetic aortic valve infective endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed an aorto-cavitary fistula (ACF) connecting the aortic root with the left ventricle, creating an intracardiac shunt, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation physiology. The patient underwent surgery with successful exclusion of the ACF. ACF is an unusual complication of infective endocarditis that creates an abnormal communication between the aortic root and the heart chambers, establishing an intracardiac shunt. This case highlights that physicians should be aware of the possibility of rare cardiac complications in infective endocarditis.

His past medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation on long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of 30% and aortic stenosis with two previous bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve replacements in 2004 and 2014. Two months prior to admission, he was diagnosed with IE caused by Group B _Streptococcus_ involving the aortic bioprosthetic valve. Initially, he presented with complaints of intermittent febrile episodes and night diaphoresis for approximately 8 weeks. At that time, the decision was made to treat him conservatively with oral antibiotics and close clinical monitoring. Blood cultures were negative in two different occasions, and the patient was discharged on stable conditions. However, a day prior to his second hospital admission, the patient noted sudden onset right upper extremity weakness (MRC power grade 3) and dysarthria. Upon further evaluation in the ED, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple embolic strokes .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed a perivalvular cavity around the aortic root, and this cavity was communicating with the aorta. Furthermore, the cavity was also in communication with the left ventricle (LV), creating a dynamic of retrograde flow, with blood passing from the aorta to the LV through the fistulous tract . As a result, the patient developed an ACF due to perivalvular endocarditis, which resulted in symptomatic severe aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【11】The patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further surgical evaluation. His physical examination was unremarkable, except for a slight right facial droop and mild dysarthria. All initial laboratory including new sets of blood cultures were unremarkable. He continued empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone. Sacubitril/valsartan and metoprolol were discontinued due to concerns of rapid progression to complete heart block in the setting of a perivalvular cavity.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

The consensus was that patient’s presentation was likely caused by a perivalvular abscess/pseudoaneurysm, which was further complicated by the formation of an ACF, requiring rapid surgical intervention. Coronary angiogram was performed as part of the preoperative evaluation, revealing smooth eccentric narrowing (50–60%) of the ostial/proximal left circumflex (LCx), which raised the suspicion of possible external compression from the known aortic root pseudoaneurysm/perivalvular abscess seen on CTA .\n\n【15】TEE in the operating room evidenced a large posterior aortic pseudoaneurysm underneath the left coronary artery, corresponding to the narrowing of the LCx. This was then confirmed by surgical exploration and visual inspection. Active infection with pus secretion was noticed around the aortic annulus, with small vegetations on the prosthesis. The surgical procedure consisted of a third cardiac redo surgery with full sternotomy, explantation of previous prosthetic aortic valve and exclusion of the ACF. The aortic root and valve were replaced with a 24 mm homograft, and the LCx was reimplanted.\n\n【16】The patient recovered without significant complications, and he went home with intravenous ceftriaxone through a peripherally inserted central catheter for a total of 6 weeks, and any further oral antibiotic therapy was not required. Close outpatient monitoring with follow-up with cardiology, neurology, infectious disease and primary care provider was arranged in the next week. All neurological manifestations were entirely resolved with treatment and rehabilitation.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】A well-documented complication of IE is the development of periannular abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, cases describing the progression of an abscess into a pseudoaneurysm that ruptures internally, while connecting the aortic root with the heart chambers, and resulting in a subsequent ACF are reported far less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. ACF is caused by the extension and infiltration of the pyogenic and necrotic tissue from the perivalvular abscess into the cardiac chambers. This results in the expansion and rupture of the weakened necrotic myocardium, creating intracardiac fistulous communication. It is possible to develop an intracardiac communication leading to blood flow dynamics similar to those seen in valvulopathies.\n\n【19】Prior to Anguera _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, the data was limited exclusively to case reports. According to this study, the prevalence of ACF is as high as 5.8% in individuals in whom endocarditis infects a prosthetic valve. TEE and cardiac MRI are valid imaging modalities for the detection of ACF in native and prosthetic valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Physicians should consider discontinuation of medications with negative chronotropic properties such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, as ACF has been associated with the development conduction abnormalities like complete heart block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The mechanism of atrioventricular conduction disorder in ACF is the result of inflammation from the bacterial colonization of the valve and surrounding tissues, and the electric conduction system of the heart is no exception. ACFs usually originate from the sinus of Valsalva, increasing the risk of invasive coronary angiography. Other imaging modalities to evaluate the coronary arteries such as coronary CTA may be considered in similar circumstances.\n\n【21】Surgery to repair the fistula is advised. Practitioners should have a high suspicion for cardiac pathology in patients presenting with IE and should not hesitate to consider urgent surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, patients who are severely hemodynamically unstable or those who have multiple comorbidities are not candidates to undergo surgery. Percutaneous procedure is another option in high-risk patients when active infection is healed with antibiotics.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT\n----------------------------\n\n【27】This case report does not require ethical approval.

A large amount of blood was aspirated through a nasogastric tube, and chest computed tomography showed bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions, which suggested aspiration pneumonitis due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Her respiratory condition exacerbated, and we initiated nitric oxide (NO) therapy. Bleeding stopped with conservative treatment. She was weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated on Day 6 after admission. Afterward, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a longitudinal linear scar indicative of Mallory–Weiss syndrome (MWS). MWS is rarely reported in early infancy since many of the risk factors are absent in infants. Patients with aspiration pneumonitis usually recover respiratory function within 24 h and severe respiratory failure is rare in aspiration pneumonitis. There are no pediatric case reports describing MWS with severe aspiration pneumonitis. Although MWS is a rare cause of neonatal hematemesis, patients can become severely ill and require multidisciplinary treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Mallory–Weiss syndrome (MWS) is a condition, in which a sudden increase in intragastric pressure causes laceration of the mucosa near the esophagogastric junction. It is a rare cause of hematemesis in infancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although it can sometimes cause anemia or even shock because of severe bleeding, no case of infant with MWS complicated with severe aspiration pneumonitis has been reported. Herein, we present a case of MWS complicated by severe aspiration pneumonitis in an infant.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 1-month-old girl presented with hematemesis and dyspnea. Two hours after breastfeeding, she suddenly vomited a large amount of fresh blood without any identifiable cause and was transferred to a hospital. A large amount of coagulated blood was aspirated through a nasogastric tube, and chest computed tomography findings showed bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions . The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【6】As acute respiratory failure progressed, she was intubated to secure the airway, and mechanical ventilation was commenced. Her hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL, and venous blood gas analysis showed mixed acidosis (pH, 7.277; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 49.5 torr; bicarbonate level, 22.6 mmol/L; base excess, −4.3 mEq/L). Red blood cells were transfused, and she was transferred to our hospital for further medical care.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions detected by chest computed tomography (A). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows a longitudinal linear scar at the gastroesophageal junction (B).</u>\n\n【8】The patient was born via normal vaginal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation. No abnormalities were noted during the perinatal period. She seldom vomited after birth. On admission, her body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and percutaneous oxygen saturation on mechanical ventilation were 36.7°C, 170 bpm, 75/42 mm Hg, and 96%, respectively. Her breathing sound decreased bilaterally. Her white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein level, and platelet count were 13 200/μl, 0.72 mg/dl, and 293 000/μl, respectively. Coagulation tests were unremarkable.\n\n【9】Her respiratory condition rapidly exacerbated and hypercapnia progressed, which were suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome because of aspiration pneumonitis. We initiated nitric oxide (NO) therapy to treat pulmonary hypertension, because ultrasonography findings showed features of increased right ventricular pressure. In addition, gastric ulcer was also considered as a source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and therefore, proton pump inhibitors were administered.\n\n【10】After NO therapy (20 ppm) initiation, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen increased from 57 to 195 torr. The patient’s respiratory condition gradually improved within 24 h, and she was weaned off mechanical ventilation. She was extubated on Day 6 after admission. Supplemental oxygen was stopped on Day 8, and she was discharged on Day 16. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 2 weeks after discharge showed a longitudinal linear scar at the gastroesophageal junction , which was consistent with the healing process of MWS. Her gastric mucosal findings were normal, and it seemed unlikely that gastric ulcer caused the bleeding. Neither reflux esophagitis nor the separation between the squamocolumnar junction and the diaphragmatic impression were pointed out by upper endoscopy findings. After stopping the administration of proton pump inhibitors, vomiting and hematemesis did not recur. Gastroesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia could be ruled out based on the endoscopic findings and her clinical course. Pathological findings of the gastric and esophageal mucosa showed nonspecific inflammation with mild eosinophilic infiltration, which did not meet the diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Hematemesis caused by MWS is a relatively rare condition in early infancy. Back-Lomaniszyn _et al._ reported that MWS accounts for 12.8% of pediatric patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. One reason for the rarity of this condition is that children rarely consume alcohol, which is known to trigger MWS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In addition, pathophysiological factors, such as greater tensile circumferential strength of the gastrointestinal tract of infants, may increase their resistance to mucosal laceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. An accurate pathogenesis of MWS in infancy has yet to be elucidated. In our case, there were no risk factors of MWS development, such as alcohol consumption, hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux. However, elevated abdominal pressure caused by heavy lifting or childbirth is a risk factor for MWS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, crying or hiccups can elevate abdominal pressure and may cause mucosal tears in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Our patient developed severe aspiration pneumonitis due to massive bleeding, which was managed with mechanical ventilation and NO therapy. Patients with aspiration pneumonitis usually recover their respiratory function within 24 h without antibiotics. One study showed that 17% of adult cases with aspiration pneumonitis were treated in intensive care units and 4% died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Few fatal pediatric cases of aspiration pneumonitis have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In one study, aspiration of stomach contents was found in 37% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Aspiration in infancy can be a cause of mortality and morbidity. The severity of our case can be attributed to the patient’s young age and inability to turn over, which caused much of the vomited blood to be aspirated into the airway. Although MWS is a rare cause of neonatal hematemesis, patients can become severely ill and require multidisciplinary treatment. Subsequent aspiration pneumonitis can cause severe respiratory failure that requires ventilator management and NO therapy. Notably, an animal study found that high-dose NO therapy may worsen lung damage when used for aspiration pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, in this case, NO therapy was necessary because hypoxia and hypercapnia progressed with conventional ventilation. Although no specific side effects were observed after providing NO therapy, careful follow-up examination is necessary to determine the long-term effects. Clinicians should consider MWS as a differential diagnosis when examining an infant who presents with hematemesis and dyspnea.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding to report for this case report.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This report was approved for publication by the ethical committee of Gunma Children’s Medical Center (GCMC2018–112).</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Akihiko Shimizu.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0a5adf29-eefc-4a5d-a396-63b8ac0178cb", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】An inverted (intussuscepted) appendix is a rare finding, often mistaken for a polyp as it presents with vague symptoms. This can result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Diagnosis is usually made through surgery. Rarely, endometriosis has been found as the cause of the intussusception. A 42-year-old woman presented with frequent loose stools over 2 years, an elevated calprotectin over 400 μg/g faeces (normal <110) and a serum C-reactive protein of 40 mg/l (normal <5 mg/l). Endoscopy showed an inverted appendix. Histopathology results showed inflammation and ulceration. Laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed successfully, and endometriosis was found on the inverted appendix. This is the first case reported of an inverted appendix containing endometriosis, in which the intussusception of the appendix has been diagnosed on endoscopy. This case highlights how endometriosis can involve just the appendix, without any involvement of reproductive organs. We suggest considering inverted appendix as a differential diagnosis when investigating caecal lesions.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】An inverted appendix, also referred to as intussusception, is rare, with a reported incidence of 0.01%. Endometriosis is the proliferation of endometrial tissue outside the endometrial cavity, classically involving pelvic organs and pelvic peritoneum. Rarely there can be intestinal involvement of endometriosis, reported to range from 3 to 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An inverted appendix can be mistaken for a caecal polyp as in previous reports, which has resulted in polypectomy and colonic perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is usually diagnosed with surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, we report here an unusual case of a patient with an inverted appendix and isolated endometriosis, with the diagnosis being made through endoscopy by the nurse endoscopist.\n\n【4】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【5】A 42-year-old woman had been suffering with chronic diarrhoea for two years, with elevated calprotectin over 400µg/g faeces (normal <110) and a CRP of 40 mg/l (normal <5 mg/l).\n\n【6】On index colonoscopy, it was reported as a large polyp in the caecum. The patient was referred to the significant polyp and early colorectal cancer (SPECC) MDT to discuss management where on reviewing the image it was felt that it was an inverted inflamed (ulcerated) appendix . **A biopsy taken from the polyp showed inflammation, ulceration and some distortion** . The patient had a small bowel MRI study, which excluded inflammatory small bowel disease but reported an abnormal caecum with the apparent polypoidal mass measuring 2.5 cm in diameter.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Close view of the polyp base, with appendiceal fold (arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Caecal polyp (inverted appendix), with wide ulceration.</u>\n\n【9】The case was discussed at the colorectal MDT and recommended to have either an ileocaecal resection or a laparoscopic appendicectomy. The patient proceeded to have a laparoscopic appendicectomy with the cuff of the caecum. To facilitate this, the caecum was mobilized from the lateral wall. The inverted appendix, 50 × 30 mm in size, showed a reverse pattern of the normal mucosa. The outer surface was lined by colonic type mucosa with lymphoid aggregates. In addition the muscularis propria contained areas of endometrial glands with associated stroma and hemosiderin deposition, in keeping with endometriosis . There was no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|At low magnification, inverted appendix lined by colonic type mucosa with underlying lymphoid aggregates.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|At higher magnification, endometrial glands and stroma in the muscularis propria.

Note the presence of a normal colonic mucosa on the right.</u>\n\n【13】Discussion\n----------\n\n【14】Presentation of an intussuscepted appendix can be acute or more commonly with chronic non-specific symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In two previous cases of inverted appendix, there was associated endometriosis on other organs and presented to the gynaecologist rather than the gastroenterology team 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. On reviewing the patient’s history, we found she did suffer with contact bleeding post coitus 5 years ago, and was investigated by gynaecology, who found that this was due to a large ectropion and cervicitis. This problem resolved with diathermy.\n\n【15】In our case, we found not only an intussuscepted appendix, but more interestingly, the presence of endometriosis. Appendiceal intussusception secondary to endometriosis is extremely rare, with less than 30 cases reported in the last 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, those cases involved endometriosis on other organs as well as the appendix. There are only three cases that has been previously reported in literature with isolated appendiceal endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, this is the first case in which diagnosis of inverted appendix was made through endoscopy, rather than surgery. Cases have also been reported of endometriosis on the appendix, without resulting in intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】It is important to highlight the differential diagnoses that were postulated originally; caecal polyp (epithelial lesion), mucocele of the appendix and/or associated neoplasm and inflammatory bowel disease, in view of the elevated calprotectin. The appendicectomy with local cuff of caecum can also help in the staging if it proved to be neoplastic.\n\n【17】Our diagnostic strategy was firstly colonoscopy, and referral to MDT, and finally MRI to rule out small bowel Crohn’s disease. Normally an inverted appendix is diagnosed through surgery and treated with laparoscopic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However in our case, when the inverted and ulcerated appendix was noted endoscopically, an MR Enterography was considered necessary to rule out additional lesions in the small bowel, that could explain the ulceration of the inverted appendix. Additional imaging such as CT is indicated in neoplastic lesions of the appendix but can be reserved after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Only by doing appendicectomy can we obtain histology with a definitive diagnosis. It was imperative we identified the lesion as an inverted appendix and not a polyp, as previous reports showed misdiagnosis and incorrect polypectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A key point is that when the well-trained nurse endoscopist diagnosed the condition, a polypectomy was not attempted, and instead the case was referred to the SPECC MDT. A second key point is that multi-disciplinary meeting helped the patient to get the appropriate treatment in a timely manner with the correct pre-op work up.\n\n【18】Although endoscopic appendicectomy has been reported, this is certainly not the standard treatment for polyps on the appendiceal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In fact, even with advanced endoscopic methods such as full thickness resection, appendicitis develops as a complication of the procedure in almost 10% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The laparoscopic appendicectomy involved resection of the caecal cuff, believed to be the ideal procedure for intussuscepted appendix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is because the cuff provides a margin of resection for appendiceal lesions, and more importantly the risk of leaving an appendiceal stump is removed. If the stump is left behind it can cause appendicitis and intussusception. It has been previously reported of a caecal intussusception post-appendicectomy, resulting in inversion of the appendiceal stump 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Endoscopic techniques, mainly endoscopic full thickness resection (EFTR) cannot be recommended in our case because of the risk of complication, and ‘lesion’ size was too large to achieve complete resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgement\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has given consent for her story to be published.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u></u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Thousands of people undergo investigations daily to explore the possibility of having coronary artery disease. With increasing demand, the range of available investigations to encompass both anatomical and functional tests for ischaemia has expanded in the last two decades. This, however, comes at the risk of replacing clinical acumen. Thus, the very first question a physician needs to answer has remained the same: What is the patient’s risk of having coronary artery disease?\n\n【1】In 1973, when the available tests were very limited, Dr Sanders T. Frank observed a common sign between 20 patients that had presented with angina: the diagonal earlobe crease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After publishing this case series in the New England Journal of Medicine, the sign is often called after his eponym. The sign is a deep wrinkle that can present unilaterally or bilaterally and extends from the tragus to the auricle at a 45° angle, as depicted in Figure 1 . The pathophysiology of the sign has remained a mystery for some time, with theories trying to explain the mechanism of its formation. A recent histological study by Stoyanov _et al._ supports the hypothesis that the presence of Frank’s sign is directly associated with atherosclerosis as the location of the line is formed prenatally and is therefore vulnerable to hypoxia-reoxygenation injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

However, there is still much controversy regarding its clinical relevance and predictive value. A study by Wang _et al._ that included 558 patients demonstrated that Frank’s sign was independently associated with a risk of coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> supported by a more recent single-blind cross-sectional study that included 1000 patients.

Other studies, however, show a weaker association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Despite the questionable sensitivity of the sign, the undeniable fact is that Frank’s sign has been documented throughout history, from the ancient Romans to Renaissance art, right through to modern-day popular culture.

Sometimes, it occurs in the left ventricular (LV) subepicardial wall.\n\n【2】This study introduces a child referred to our hospital with influenza-like symptoms and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, followed by cardiac failure. However, in our subsequent evaluation, there was evidence of severe LV and RV dysfunction based on the echocardiography. Moreover, cardiac magnetic resonance showed not only the major criteria of ARVC but also those of Lake Luise seen in myocarditis. Regarding the deteriorating condition during the hospital course, he was later scheduled for heart transplantation.\n\n【3】Finally, the histopathological study of explanted heart revealed RV myocyte atrophy with the infiltration of fibrofatty tissue in myocardium diagnostic of ARVC, resolving dilemma between ARVC and myocarditis.\n\n【4】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【5】Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder that leads to predominantly right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an excellent diagnostic modality in this disease, and the pathological findings also support it significantly. This case introduces a patient who had a combination of ARVC findings and myocarditis in CMR.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 9-year-old boy was admitted to pediatric ward with a history of flu-like symptoms of 1-week duration followed by abdominal pain.\n\n【8】He was on methylphenidate (10 mg/day) due to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for 4 years; his past medical history was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【9】In his family history, the sudden death of a sister at the age of 17 was considerable in which she had not been evaluated.\n\n【10】In the physical examination, he was afebrile with a 90/70 mm Hg blood pressure and an average cardiac rate of 135 beats/min. His oxygen saturation was 92% with no supplemental oxygen, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min was noted.\n\n【11】Moreover, his heart rhythm was irregular due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Also, lung auscultation revealed diminished basal sounds, and abdomen bulged with positive shifting dullness but no peripheral edema. Regarding this finding, abdominal sonography was performed which indicated the significant ascites. Consequently, an abdominal tap was conducted that showed a transudative fluid.\n\n【12】The lab data revealed an elevated cardiac troponin I (~1300 ng/ml), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (15 000 pg/ml) and C-reactive protein was (22 mg/l). His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 56 mm/h. The electrolytes were normal, and so was his complete blood count. Bilateral pleural effusion was observed in chest X-ray. The evidence of sinus tachycardia, epsilon wave and bigeminy PVCs were found, but no other remarkable findings were detected on electrocardiography (ECG) . Besides, transthoracic echocardiography illustrated a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (~20%) coupled with severe RV systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, color Doppler echocardiography revealed a severe regurgitation of mitral and tricuspid valves.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) The 12-lead ECG shows slight sinus tachycardia, epsilon wave, and T wave inversion in V1 and ( **B** ) Holter monitoring shows frequent premature ventricular complexes.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) B-SSFP image in mid short axis view shows the RV regional microaneurysm formation (yellow arrow), ( **B** ) STIR image reveals the regional myocardial edema (blue areas), ( **C** ) LGE image in SAX view indicates RV and LV apical clots (yellow arrow) and RV fibrosis (red arrow), ( **D** ) LGE image in mid-SAX view illustrates LV lateral wall subepicardial fibrosis (yellow arrowhead) and ( **E** ) LGE in axial view shows the multiple RV apical clots.

A significant decrease was also observed in RV EF (15%) and RV end-diastolic volume index (120 cc/m <sup>2 </sup> ), which met the major criteria of ARVC. Biventricular apical clot, active myocardial edema and fibrosis of base and mid-LV lateral wall were also identified . Based on CMR data, a precise differentiation was challenging between active myocarditis and acute phase of ARVC.\n\n【16】During hospital course, repetitive ventricular tachyarrhythmia episodes occurred , for which amiodarone and lidocaine were prescribed to suppress ventricular arrhythmia, and intravenous immunoglobulin with corticosteroid was administered with suspicion of possible myocarditis.\n\n【17】Nevertheless, because of refractory ventricular arrhythmia and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) IV, successful heart transplantation was done after 1 month despite full medical treatment. Besides, examining removed heart at transplantation was done. Moreover, in the gross pathologic specimen, RV had a thin, papered appearance. In the histologic specimens at LV lateral and septal wall, as well as RV free wall, there was evidence of fat replacement in RV free wall accompanied by myocardial fiber atrophy. Moreover, LV sections showed focal epicardial fibrosis with scant inflammation and focal myocytolysis .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) RV specimen indicates the evidence of RV free wall fat replacement and adjacent myocardial fiber atrophy and ( **B** ) LV specimen revealed focal epicardial fibrosis and scant inflammatory cell infiltration with focal myocytolysis.</u>\n\n【19】During a 14-month follow-up after the heart transplantation, the patient had NYHA FC = I. Endomyocardial biopsy showed no evidence of rejection, and heart catheterization revealed that RV pressure was ~20/6, mean pulmonary artery pressure = 12 mmHg, LV end-diastolic pressure of 10 mmHg and aortic pressure was ~105/60 mmHg. Moreover, the echocardiography data documented a preserved biventricular performance (LV EF = 50%, aortic velocity-time index = 16 cm, E/E′ = 10, RV ‘tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion’ = 18 cm and systolic tissue velocity of tricuspid valve annulus = 9 cm/s) with no more than mild valvular regurgitation.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】This patient was a challenging case with several findings in favor of active myocarditis versus an acute phase ARVC or a combination of both.\n\n【22】In this regard, the acute clinical picture of disease with a rise in cardiac biomarker levels, LV involvement, and CMR tissue characterization findings supported the diagnosis of active myocarditis. In contrast, RV regional microaneurysm formation, severely diminished RV systolic performance in CMR coupled with RV myocardial atrophy and fibrofatty replacement in the histologic specimens were in favor of ARVC. In a case series including six pediatric patients with a genetic diagnosis of ARVC who presented by myocarditis-like symptoms, active inflammation in myocardium compatible with acute myocarditis was seen in CMR in all the cases; however, it was without any evidence of documented infection preceding this episode, except in one patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】In previous case, three main hypotheses can be concluded based on clinical, imaging, histology, and lab data.\n\n【24】1.  Myocarditis superimposed on ARVC: The first hypothesis states that diseased myocardium in ARVC is more susceptible to a viral infection which results in the myocardial inflammation superimposed on ARVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】2.  Cardiotropic viruses with consequent ARVC: The second hypothesis assumes some viruses such as enterovirus and adenovirus can activate the mediators that damage the cardiac adherent junctions. Moreover, this process results in the irritability of ventricular myocardium with or without ion channel disruption and consequent ARVC symptomatology as a result of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】These cardiotropic viruses involve both ventricular myocardia with the complex cellular and adherent junction interaction, resulting in RV and LV inflammation and apoptosis that eventually induces myocardial fibrosis and remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, in a case report study by Tanawuttiwat _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, they assumed that there was a likelihood of insult from myocarditis by acquiring a desmosomal injury that eventually led to the anatomic and clinical presentations of ARVC.\n\n【27】1.  The active phase of ARVC: The third hypothesis reinforces the concept that these myocarditis-like episodes are active phases of ARVC itself. In this line, Duarte Martins _et al_ . indicated the data which ARVC could manifest as recurrent myocarditis-like episodes in the presence of myocardial inflammation evidence in CMR without an infectious trigger. They hypothesized that this presentation was an ‘active hot phase’ of disease course which might lead to disease progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】We suppose that, in our case with preceding flu-like symptoms coupled with the significant LV involvement and cardiac biomarkers rise, the first and also the second hypotheses are at the top of list. However, we cannot completely rule out the acute phase of full-blown biventricular failure due to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, especially when a family history of sudden death exists. Unfortunately, the genetic and molecular analyses were not performed for this patient and his family, due to the high price of the test.\n\n【29】Because of our case and another rare case report that has shown the relationship between acute myocarditis and ARVC, we suggest a comprehensive assessment of RV by cardiac imaging accompanied with the genetic test in the case of acute myocarditis to rule out ARVC, especially when the representing symptom is a cardiac arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support was received for this study.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We declare that we have taken a permission note from the patient parent to publish the case report.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient parents have signed an informed consent form to participate in this study.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nahid Rezaeian is the guarantor of this study.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In this report, we describe a case of gastric metastasis from a primary breast cancer occurring 20 years after mastectomy.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 79-year-old woman who had undergone a left breast mastectomy 20 years ago presented with epigastric discomfort. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography at our hospital revealed a thickened gastric wall and type 4 advanced gastric cancer without direct invasion of the surrounding organs. In addition, there was no obvious lymph node enlargement; however, evidence of suspected bone metastasis in the thoracic vertebrae and sciatica were found. Endoscopic findings from the previous physician showed stiffness and enlarged folds of the gastric body, and histopathological examination led to the diagnosis of linitis plastica gastric cancer. She was then referred to our hospital for close examination and treatment of type 4 advanced gastric cancer. Although mastectomy was performed many years ago and the symptoms were not typical, we performed an EGD again in consideration of gastric metastasis of breast carcinoma. Biopsy samples were taken from the lesion in the gastric body , and from the antrum, which appeared normal on EGD . All biopsy sites showed signet-ring cell carcinoma infiltration. IHC revealed diffuse nuclear expressions of estrogen receptor and GATA binding protein 3 in the neoplastic cells, whereas E-cadherin was mostly negative in the neoplastic cell membranes . Chest and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormal findings in the right breast, and this case was considered to have gastric metastasis due to postoperative recurrence of left breast cancer. This is a very rare case of breast cancer observed 20 years after mastectomy. IHC led to a definitive diagnosis, and chemotherapy was decided. Currently, she is on oral therapy with 2.5 mg/day letrozole. During the course of treatment, she presented with cellulitis of the left upper extremity for a time, which improved, and she is continuing her current treatment with no side effects of chemotherapy or significant elevation of tumor markers.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|**Endoscopic images** The gastric body mainly exhibits gastric wall stiffness and poor wall distension (a), with no erosions or ulcerations suggestive of a primary lesion; normal mucosa is observed in the pyloric antrum (b).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|**Metastasis of breast cancer to the stomach** Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows an infiltrating adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features in the gastric lamina propria; IHC reveals diffuse nuclear expressions of estrogen receptor and GATA binding protein 3 in the neoplastic cells, whereas E-cadherin is mostly negative in the neoplastic cell membranes.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】The common metastatic organs affected by breast cancer include bone, brain, liver and lung.

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two based on clinical course, endoscopic findings and imaging studies.

Mucormycosis is an opportunistic infection and usually a rare condition.

A new recognized risk factor for this opportunistic infection is the rampant use of corticosteroids in a background of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which facilitates mucormycosis by different mechanisms including, low oxygen and acidotic environment, high iron and glucose level and impaired function of phagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although it affects most commonly the paranasal sinuses, the presence of mucormycosis in the laryngeal tract is a very rare condition. In this context, we review a rare case of subglottic invasive mucormycosis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old woman presented with malaise, fever and shortness of breath 4 weeks before admission. She had a history of DM and hypothyroidism and was treated with Metformin and Levothyroxine. She had no history of COVID-19 exposure. Physical examination revealed a conscious woman with no respiratory distress. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 105/70 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats/min, body temperature 38.2°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and no pulmonary rales nor crackles. Although, the initial laboratory test showed poor controlled DM (fasting blood sugar: 245 mg/dl and HbA1C: 11). A Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was done and revealed multilobar ground glass opacification, which was in favor of COVID-19 infection . She was admitted to the ward based on peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88% and received 4–5 l per minute of oxygen nasally. Dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day/IV and Remdesivir 200 mg stat and then 100 mg daily/intravenous (IV) were started. Also, she was given regular and NPH insulin, and they were adjusted every day to control plasma glucose. RT-PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2; COVID-19 Delta variant). During the course of treatment, on September 22 at 4:00 P.M, she developed mild hot potato speech, dyspnea and subtle respiratory distress. Indirect laryngoscopy could not be done due to severe pooling and lack of patient’s cooperation. As her symptoms worsen over time, a spiral chest, PNS and neck CT scan with IV contrast was done and revealed normal paranasal sinuses and the lung parenchyma, with resolved pulmonary opacities. Soft tissue swelling of the right side of the supraglottis, glottis and subglottis were depicted on the neck CT scan. A non-enhancing soft tissue in favor of necrosis was visible in the posterior subglottis, with extra laryngeal extension posterior to the upper trachea . Based on the initial impression of bacterial subglottis infection, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) were started giving an infectious disease consultation, other treatment was continued with close observation. Initially, her respiration got better, but over the next 2 days, her breathing became progressively labored. Video laryngoscopy was done and revealed a yellowish lesion in the subglottic area . She underwent an emergency awake tracheostomy. Following tracheostomy, direct laryngoscopy revealed ~1\\*1.5 cm white to yellowish lesion similar to crusting and necrosis in the subglottis. Multiple biopsies were taken and sent to the laboratory for histopathological and mycological evaluations. Microscopic examination showed scattered areas of necrosis infiltrated by numerous large, branching non-septate hyphae. The hyphae mostly demonstrated significant branching at 90-degree angles. Also, scattered inflammatory cells infiltration was seen in surrounding vital tissue. Additional ancillary histochemical staining (Periodic Acid Schiff—PAS- and Grocott’s Methenamine Silver—GMS) confirmed the presence of the fungal hyphae throughout the specimen, in favor of mucormycosis . Dexamethasone was discontinued and she was given liposomal amphotericin B 250 mg/IV/daily. The follow-up laryngoscopy showed a subglottic lesion about 1-week post-operation. Therefore, she underwent another direct laryngoscopy with debridement of the subglottic necrosis. The following indirect video laryngoscopy after about 1 week after the second debridement showed no sign of any necrosis or lesion. The general condition of the patient was completely improved after 4 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B and there was no evidence of recurrence during the outpatient follow-ups after 4 weeks of oral Posaconazole (5 cc/every 6 h) .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Chest CT scan was done and revealed multilobar ground glass opacification, which was in favor of COVID-19.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Axial contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck depicts soft tissue swelling of the right side of the supraglottis, the glottis and the subglottis.

Depending on the underlying conditions and the risk factors, mucormycosis have a specific predilection to affect common anatomic sites like sinus, orbit and respiratory tracts in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Wolf _et al._ reported a poor control DM patient with an intraluminal mucormycosis in the first tracheal ring that was treated after infected tissue resection and prolonged amphotericin B 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In another report Mohindra _et al._ described a female DM patient with tracheal mucormycosis after H1N1 influenza 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It seems that like our case DM is the main predisposing condition correlated with upper respiratory mucormycosis.\n\n【13】The differential diagnosis for the necrotic lesion in subglottis includes secondary ischemic injury to the tracheal wall due to prolonged intubation, neoplastic lesions (chondrosarcoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and lymphoproliferative disorders), inflammatory diseases (Wegener’s granulomatosis and sarcoidosis) and infectious disease (bacterial, tuberculosis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>). Biopsy of the lesion is important for precise diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【14】Current guidelines recommend a combined medical and surgical approach for achieving the best outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Liposomal amphotericin B is the mainstay antifungal treatment for mucormycosis. Surgical debridement of the involved area in conjunction with antifungal treatment is also necessary as performed in this case and the in older reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The mortality rate and survival of the patients with mucormycosis depend on several factors. Although, many studies reported a high mortality rate for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14–16 \\]</u> but the severity of underlying medical disorders, early initiation of antifungal therapy and effective surgical debridement have key roles in the prognosis of the patients. Surgical debridement without reversing the immunocompromised conditions is not adequate and may lead to disseminated disease and also required repeated debridement. Even one study demonstrated that controlling the underlying DM, and antifungal therapy without surgical debridement is a good treatment option in localized diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, special consideration should be given to the underlying immunosuppression status and stop the rampant use of corticosteroid because mucormycosis usually do not affect an immunocompetent person. Furthermore, it has been shown that patients with tracheal mucormycosis and limited pulmonary involvement have better survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Our patients had isolated subglottis involvement without rhino–orbito–cerebral or pulmonary mucormycosis. Fortunately, early diagnosis and combined antifungal therapy and serial surgical debridement of necrotic tissues in conjunction with aggressive control of the blood glucose and also, discontinuation of dexamethasone are the keys to our successful outcome.\n\n【16】The interesting aspects of this case were the presence of mucormycosis in a rare anatomical site with atypical clinical presentation. The patient developed the symptoms in a period of active COVID-19 (Delta variant) disease. The management of the patient was similar to current guidelines.\n\n【17】During the COVID-19 era, any necrotic tissue in the airways in immunocompromised patients should raise suspicion of mucormycosis and be diagnosed early with a rapid biopsy of the affected area.\n\n【18】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The project received institutional research ethics board approval prior to the beginning of the study from the Otolaryngology Research Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex Ethics Board.\n\n【20】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【21】Not applicable.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【23】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【24】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【25】Not applicable.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】None declared.\n\n【28】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【29】MSZ and BA did the tracheostomy, tissue debridement of the patient and gathered the necessary data and were the major contributor in writing the manuscript.

The result of weight for the age was −3.29 standard deviation (SD), height for the age was −0.83 SD, weight for the height was −3 SD and mid upper arm circumference for the age was −3 SD (World Health Organization growth chart). Body weight before having these symptoms was 10 kg and he was having meals three times a day with carbohydrate (rice), protein (eggs, fish and chicken), and vegetables.\n\n【13】Laboratory examinations showed anemia (hemoglobin: 6.3 g/dl; N: 11.5–13.5 g/dl), leucocytosis (white blood cells:19 010/μl; N: 5500–15 500/μl), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin: 2.03 g/dl; N: 3.4–5.0 g/dl), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (serum CRP: 10.18 mg/dl; N: <0.3 mg/dl). Stool examination showed that diarrhea was a dysenteriform (leucocyte: 6–9/hpf). On the 15th day, IgM anti salmonella typhi(Tubex® TF) performed with a result of 6.00 (reactive). Blood culture revealed _Salmonella_ spp. that is sensitive to ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, tigecycline, aztreonam, meropenem and resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, amikacin, ampicillin and cefazolin. On the 26th day, seramoeba test (Entamoebalisa IgG) performed with non-reactive result.\n\n【14】Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple liver cyst at the right liver lobe. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple inhomogen hypodense lesions at the IV, V, VI and VII sections of the right liver lobe, the largest lesion was 9.5 cm × 8.8 cm × 11.5 cm, suggestive of multiple liver cyst. Due to prolonged fever, abdominal distention and multiple cysts findings in the liver, the surgery was planned to remove the cysts that might be infected but delayed because of prolonged fever, waiting for preoperative imaging and then due to limited facility availability for postoperative intensive care unit.\n\n【15】The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy on the 42nd day of hospitalization. We found a dilated common bile duct adhered to the inferior side of the liver, gall bladder, transverse colon and stomach, containing 500 cc of bile fluid. No intrahepatic cyst was found. Intraoperative cholangiography revealed only extrahepatic bile duct dilatation without intrahepatic duct involvement. We performed choledocal cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Amebic cysts and rod shape bacteria were found in the microscopic examination of bile fluid .\n\n【16】The patient was diagnosed with type 1 choledocal cyst with secondary infections of amebiasis and _Salmonella typhi_ with severe malnutrition. During hospitalization, the patient was given ampicillin and gentamicin for the first 3 days, and then changed based on blood culture results and cilinical signs of intestinal infection to chloramphenicol and metronidazole for 40 days. The patient improved after 13 days of antibiotic and antiparasitic administration. For calory requirement we used a formula of resting energy expenditure multiply stress factor with a result 700 kcal/day consisting of 3 meals. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative Day 1. Clinical condition improved with significant weight gain after 1 month of discharge.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】Choledocal cyst is a congenital dilatation of biliary tree and is most commonly found in children, especially in Asia. Pancreatobiliary malunion was thought to cause the disease. Large cysts can cause spontaneous bleeding, infection, and compression to biliary duct branches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, we found type I choledocal cyst, which was a dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct. It is the most common type and seen in 75–85% of cases. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the diagnostic method of choice for biliary ductal pathology. Obstruction usually due to stenotic distal duct and sludge may cause cholangitis. To prevent cholangitis and malignant progression, the definitive treatment of choledocal cyst is total cystectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\n\n【19】In 1968, Babbitt’s described an abnormality of pancreaticobiliar union (APBDU) in three children with choledocal cysts and hypothesized this abnormality was the cause of choledocal cysts. APBDU is defined as the union of the pancreatic and biliary ducts outside the duodenal wall and proximal to the Ampulla of Vater. Choledocal cysts are divided into Type IA, IB, IC, II, III, IV and V 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Acute suppurative cholangitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with biliary diseases. Bacteria, usually from the gastrointestinal tract through the lymphatic system or blood vessels, ascend along the bile duct and cause of inflammation of it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The most common micro-organisms associated with cholangitis were _Escherichia coli_ (17.5%), _Klebsiella_ spp. (15.7%), _Pseudomonas_ spp. (14.6%) and _Salmonella_ spp. (5.8%), _S. typhi_ (53.8%), _S. enteritidis_ (17.9%) and _S. typhimurium_ (10.7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The mechanism of the presence of cystic form _E. hystolytica_ in bile fluid without evidence of a liver abscess is still unknown. Routes to the gall bladder could through the sphincter of Oddi that usually seen in patients who have undergone surgical intervention or could migrate to the liver via descending or hematogenous route and secreted in bile fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The stool examination and seroameba shown negative results, this might be caused by the low sensitivity and specificity of conventional microscopy on a single stool specimen for different species of _Entamoeba_ , or can also be caused by chronic amebic infections. Moreover, _E histolytica_ and _E. dispar_ are morphologically identical but the last one can cause negative seroameba examination. Species should be differentiated using zymodane analysis that unfortunately we did not perform.\n\n【22】In this patient, _Salmonellas_ spp. was isolated from both blood and stool _._ We believe that this patient might have had a chronic amebiasis or maybe infection by _E. dispar_ and _Salmonella typhi_ infection at the beginning. Secondary bacteremia supervened and severe malnourishment might have contributed to this condition because as we know, it can impair the immune system, besides the condition itself contributed to the low intake that could make the malnourished condition become severe.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】Choledocal cysts should be considered in pediatric patients with infection and multiple hepatic cyst. MRCP should be done to evaluate this congenital biliary dilatation. Percutaneous cyst drainage may be needed to relieve the cholangitis faster before performing definitive surgery that might help to shorten the duration of antibiotic given. Recognition of the clinical manifestations of choledocal cysts is needed for the early management and to prevent secondary infections and complications such as further malnourishment that can affect the prognosis and recovery phase for the patient to undergo surgery.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None Declared.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No Ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Riyadi adrizain.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present a 60-year-old man with a tender left-sided neck mass due to a ruptured aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Cultures taken intraoperatively grew _Salmonella enterica_ ser Dublin.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Infection with _Salmonella enterica_ usually results in a self-limited gastroenteritis characterized by fever, diarrhea, and less often nausea, vomiting and headache. However, according to CDC data, ~8% of laboratory confirmed cases are complicated by bacteremia, arteritis, meningitis and osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Occasionally, extraintestinal infections result in infected or mycotic aneurysms. In the USA, _Staphylococcus_ is the most common organism associated with mycotic aneurysms, whereas _Salmonella_ is much more common in East Asian countries such as China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Mycotic aneurysms associated with _Salmonella_ infection rupture over 50% of the time and if untreated have a mortality ranging from 16 to 44% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Thus, prompt recognition and treatment are key to improved patient outcomes. We report the first published case of a middle-aged man who developed a carotid mycotic aneurysm due _S. enterica_ ser Dublin, a serovar that is usually associated with cattle (ground beef and unpasteurized milk).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer (treated with docetaxel ~2 weeks prior to presentation), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on rivaroxaban) and right knee osteoarthritis (status post total knee replacement) presented to the emergency room with left sided neck pain and swelling. He first noted left sided neck pain 1 to 2 weeks prior to presentation. Initially, he noted some discomfort and a small nodule on his left neck. However, the nodule grew over time and the pain progressed to the point where he noted discomfort with swallowing and breathing. Accordingly, he presented to our medical center for care. On the day of admission, he was febrile (38.7°C), tachycardic 通用删除7(英):<u>(122)</u>, hypertensive (152/94). Fortunately, despite the tender neck swelling, there was no airway compromise.\n\n【6】The physical exam revealed a tender non-pulsatile mass on the left neck extending to the angle of the mandible. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck with contrast revealed a focal outpouching of the left carotid artery . There also appeared to be a mass encircling the left carotid artery (4.3 cm × 2.5 cm × 3 cm) with lateral displacement and compression of the left jugular vein.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|CT scan (coronal) of neck with contrast showing thrombosed aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery (arrow)</u>\n\n【8】A vascular surgery consultation was obtained and given concern for a contained ruptured aneurysm, the patient was taken to the operating room (OR). During the surgery, an aneurysm with a posterior perforation and contained rupture was noted . Pathological specimens from the surgical site were notable for significant atherosclerotic disease. Also, purulence was noted along with extravasated blood and cultures taken from intraoperative specimens revealed pan sensitive _S. enterica_ ser Dublin. The affected and ulcerated portion of the carotid artery was excised and replaced via end-to-end anastomoses with a bovine mesenteric vein graft. Interestingly, all peripheral blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. He was treated with ceftriaxone 2 grams IV daily for at least 6 weeks.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Perforated posterior wall of the left internal carotid artery seen intraoperatively (arrow)</u>\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】We report the case of a middle-aged man who presented with a subacute painful neck swelling that was due to a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the left carotid artery. Given his history of cancer, a malignant metastasis was among the differential diagnoses. However, CT imaging helped us to quickly narrow the list of possibilities.\n\n【12】The concern for a ruptured aneurysm prompted a vascular surgery consultation and ultimately surgical exploration. The aneurysm was found to be infected with Salmonella. Mycotic aneurysms of the carotid artery are relatively rare and those due to _Salmonella_ spp. are even rarer. Our review of the literature revealed ~22 published cases of a carotid mycotic aneurysm due to _Salmonella_ spp. Mycotic aneurysms tend to involve the aorta causing aortitis with or without aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only ~5% of mycotic aneurysms involve the carotid artery. In general, male gender is a risk factor for development of mycotic aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Other risk factors include age >50, diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Our patient had many of the traditional risk factors. He was also fully anticoagulated while the aneurysm was developing and had recently been treated with chemotherapy. We suspect that these factors likely contributed to his presentation as well.\n\n【13】We did not identify a discrete episode of gastroenteritis or bacteremia. He had been taking chemotherapy ~2 weeks prior to presentation so typical symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting might have been misattributed to medication side effects. There are a few published case reports of mycotic aneurysms due to Salmonella with negative blood cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. This may reflect the fact that gram negative bacteremia is frequently transient.\n\n【14】The standard management of mycotic aneurysms is open surgical repair. There are multiple case reports describing an endovascular approach, but studies comparing endovascular versus open repairs are lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A minimum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy is often recommended although there are no data to support a specific duration of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The Maryland State Health Department performed the microbiological testing in this case and confirmed the Dublin serotype, which usually causes gastroenteritis in both cattle and humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There are very few case reports of mycotic abdominal aneurysms due to the Dublin serotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of carotid mycotic aneurysm associated with the Dublin serotype. Although most _Salmonella_ spp outbreaks have been linked to eggs, poultry and occasionally pet reptiles, outbreaks due to _S. enterica_ ser Dublin have been linked to the consumption of contaminated ground beef and raw or unpasteurized milk. The Centers for Disease Control reported an outbreak of the Dublin serotype in 2019 that involved eight states. The outbreak was linked to ground beef 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】This case report brings into focus several important clinical and epidemiological points. First, an infected aneurysm should be considered in the differential diagnosis for a patient who is febrile and presents with a tender neck mass. Second, since mycotic aneurysms frequently rupture, prompt referral to a vascular surgeon is paramount. Finally, since our patient likely contracted _S. enterica_ ser Dublin from ground beef or milk, it is imperative that we continue surveillance for this organism in our environment.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This Case Report does not require IRB approval as it is not considered research and does not contain any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A signed written consent was obtained from the patient for this case report.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Adrien L.

Although diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known complication of diabetes, diabetes mellitus is usually protective of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to DKA is extremely rare; however, cardiogenic shock is a potential complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. We present a rare case describing diabetic ketoacidosis leading to profound acidosis causing stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that is successfully managed with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】The patient is a 25-year-old woman with no prior medical problems who felt weakness and lethargy for 2 days. She was found unresponsive and brought to the hospital. Initial physical exam revealed Kussmaul breathing at a rate of 32 respirations/minute, heart rate of 113 beats per minute and blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg. The patient’s extremities were cool and clammy. Initial glucose was incalculably high. She received 3 liters (L) fluid and started on insulin at 6 units per hour. Initial lab work revealed pH < 7.0 and a bicarbonate of 2 meq. Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with borderline prolonged QTc at 501 ms. BNP elevated at 329 on admission. Initial troponin 0.27 ng/mL, peaking at 4.68 ng/mL.\n\n【4】Shortly after her arrival to ICU, she became hypotensive. The patient’s acidosis was managed aggressively with 8 additional liters of isotonic fluid, a sodium bicarbonate drip, a total of 550 meq of sodium bicarbonate, electrolyte repletion and maintenance on an insulin infusion. Bedside cardiac ultrasound was concerning for an ejection fraction (EF) 20–25% with regional wall motion abnormality, suspicious but typical for stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission confirmed these findings and demonstrated basal and mid anterior wall abnormalities as well as basal and mid-septal abnormalities, consistent with the typical pattern of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . A bubble study was negative for shunts. Cardiology and cardiac surgery were consulted emergently.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic Echocardiography, Hospitalization Day 1.

Patient clinical picture was more consistent with cardiogenic shock at this point. The patient was also developing an acute kidney injury with oliguria despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. She was not a candidate for a mechanical assist device, including Impella, because of her short stature, so the decision was made to initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). TEE was performed at the request of the cardiac surgery team at time of VA-ECMO cannulation. With initial settings of pump speed 3905 revolutions/minute (rpm), blood flow 4.75 liters/min, FiO2 of 100%, Sweep O2 of 2, she was transferred to a tertiary center.\n\n【7】The cardiac transplant team evaluated the patient while she remained on VA-ECMO for 6 days. Right heart catheterisation was performed on hospital day 6 while the patient was maintained on milrinone, revealing central venous pressure 17, pulmonary artery pressure 35/24 通用删除7(英):<u>(27)</u>, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 23, cardiac output 7.4, cardiac index 4, systemic vascular resistance 832, prior to decannulation. A left heart catheterisation revealed no coronary artery disease.\n\n【8】Further work to evaluate potential alternative causes of cardiomyopathy included COVID testing that was negative on admission; additionally, COVID antibodies were negative. Viral titers including Epstein–Barr virus, Coxsackie virus, Human Herpes Virus, Parvovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis panel and HIV were essentially unremarkable. Autoimmune cardiomyopathy was considered, and ANA and ANCA were negative. All four criteria for diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy were met based on the mayo clinic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy  revealed no significant inflammation, granulomas, giant cells or fibrosis. Additional staining with Congo Red excluded amyloid deposition. Additionally, iron staining did not reveal any significant hemosiderosis. The only explanation for this patient’s cardiomyopathy is stress-induced cardiomyopathy, secondary to profound acidemia in DKA. The patient’s hospital course was further complicated by the development of polyglandular failure and polyradiculoneuropathy of bilateral lower extremities, confirmed with EMG testing, ultimately consistent with toxic/inflammatory neuropathy secondary to profound shock and metabolic derangements after extensive imaging and lab studies, including MRI, US, were unrevealing for other attributable causes. A diagnosis of type I diabetes mellitus was confirmed with anti-GAD antibodies. It was felt that her polyglandular failure was strongly related to an autoimmune process related to her type-1 diabetes. The patient received five sessions of IVIG.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Endomyocardial biopsy. Hematoxylin and eosin stain.

Her cardiac and renal function eventually fully recovered. Repeat TTE on hospital day 6 demonstrated a recovery of EF to 50% with global hypokinesis . She was transferred out of the cardiac ICU on hospital day 10 and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation unit after a 23-day hospital stay, maintained on daily aspirin, lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiography, hospitalisation day 6.

It has been described more frequently in recent years as a cause of cardiomyopathy, when ischemic cardiomyopathy and all other potential causes are ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is a potentially fatal possible complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy if it is not recognised and managed appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is described in less than 10% of cases related to stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】We present a rare case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that was successfully managed by VA-ECMO in a previous healthy 25-year-old female who was diagnosed with severe DKA.\n\n【15】Various endocrine conditions have been described as precipitating stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Although diabetes has been described as protective against stress-induced cardiomyopathy, the patient’s profound acidosis was significant enough to overcome any protective benefit and lead to cardiogenic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. All other causes of transient cardiomyopathy were ruled out with extensive work during her admission.\n\n【16】The prompt recognition of cardiogenic shock is vital to ensuring favorable outcomes. In our case, cardiogenic shock was identified within the first few hours of presentation, and prompt management and initiation of VA-ECMO led to the patient’s meaningful recovery.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no acknowledgements to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Riley Gurreri, DO.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is followed by hyperglycemia, and other systemic diseases. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea associated with the same etiology have been reported, but cases with different etiologies have rarely been reported. We report a case in which the patient experienced both strokes and post-stroke-related hyperglycemic hemichorea. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain appeared different in these two episodes. Our case demonstrates the importance of evaluating every patient presented with recurrent hemichorea carefully, as the disorder may be caused by different conditions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The unilateral movement disorder, hemichorea, commonly stems from acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of contralateral cerebral lesions and is typically followed by hyperglycemia and other systemic diseases, such as hypoglycemia, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea have been reported and associated with the same etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>, However, different etiologies could contribute to the recurrence of hemichorea in the same patient. Differential diagnosis should be made by detailed history taking, laboratory examinations and image studies. Among them, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a helpful tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this work, we report a case of recurrent same-side hemichorea with different etiologies diagnosed by brain MRI images.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 58-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes for 12 years was presented at our hospital 4 years ago. Because of poor compliance, the patient has not been able to achieve the target glycemic treatment goal during the past 4 years. We observed two episodes of right hemichorea resulting in similar involuntary movements but in different brain MRI images and etiologies.\n\n【6】### The first episode\n\n【7】The first episode of right hemichorea brought him to our emergency room 2 weeks after a fall. Hyperglycemia (712 mg/dl) was also noted at that time. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain disclosed no specific findings. He was admitted and an MRI scan of the brain showed an old lacunar infarct at the left basal ganglion . His right hemichorea was resolved the day after admission without any treatment of the disorder. He had no neurologic deficit. Basal bolus insulin therapy was given for blood sugar control, and aspirin was given to prevent recurrent stroke after discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MR FLAIR image demonstrated one tiny hyperintensity lesion on basal ganglia (arrow) in patient’s first admission.</u>\n\n【9】### The second episode\n\n【10】After 4 years of follow-ups in the outpatient department, the patient’s compliance was still poor. He was hospitalized because of involuntary movement in his right upper limb and right jaw for 2 weeks. The involuntary movement subsided when he fell asleep. The neurological examination showed that muscle power and sensation of bilateral limbs were intact. His blood sugar was high (671 mg/dl) without ketoacidosis. The serum creatinine level was normal, and the HbA1c was 17.3%. A CT scan of brain showed increased density in the left basal ganglia . Further MRI scan was also performed to exclude acute stroke and disclosed an increased signal intensity on the T1-weighted image in left basal ganglion , which was compatible with hyperglycemic hemichorea. Initially, we prescribed Clonazepam and haloperidol for the hemichorea and basal bolus insulin for the hyperglycemia. His blood sugar improved dramatically, but the hemichorea only improved a little after 10 days of hospitalization. He was discharged with Clonazepam 0.5 mg QD for the hemichorea, and basal insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control. Two weeks later at an outpatient visit, his hemichorea improved gradually because the blood sugar was better controlled.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Brain CT scan showed increased density in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|T1 MRI showed hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】We reported a case of recurrent hemichorea in a 58-year-old man exhibiting different etiologies demonstrated by specific brain MRI findings. The most common cause of hemichorea is acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and the second is hyperglycemic hemichorea. Other causes including hypoglycemia, Sydenham’s disease, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome have also been reported. These different etiologies of hemichorea result in different brain imaging appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Typically, in hyperglycemic hemichorea, CT scans show hyperdense lesions at the contralateral basal ganglia and T1 MRI shows hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Both the CT and T1 MRI of our patient showed similar features. In an acute stroke, the MRI demonstrates lesions with hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images and with hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In an old ischemic stroke, MR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images demonstrate hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In hypoglycemia, T2 hyperintensity was noted at the basal ganglia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In uremia, T2 hyperintensity lesions with edematous and a rim enhancement were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, the MRI is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of the causes of hemichorea.\n\n【15】In addition, hyperglycemic hemichorea is a rare neurologic complication of poorly controlled diabetes, which was first described by Bedwell in 1960 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Most cases were old Asian women. The prognosis of hyperglycemic hemichorea was good and rare recurrences were reported after blood sugar was better controlled. The mean recovery days of hyperglycemic hemichorea is about 69 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, according to a recent report in Korea. Blood sugar control is key for the recovery of hyperglycemic hemichorea and neuroimage findings on follow-up MRIs are usually reversible as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In our patient, recurrent hemichorea with different etiologies was diagnosed primarily based on different neuroimaging findings, but also based on differences in the durations of the courses. The duration of the hemichorea was short for the first episode and diagnosed to be stroke related. The duration of the hemichorea was longer for the second episode and was diagnosed to be hyperglycemia related. This could be caused by the different etiologies or by hyperglycemic stress superimposed on the same atherosclerotic lesion.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by grant FEMH-2022-C-013 from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written and signed informed consent for publication of clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rong Lin is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Sporadic cases are still reported, particularly among alcoholics and malnourished. Herein we present an unusual case of a previously healthy 15-year-old Caucasian girl, who was recently hospitalized for low velocity spine fractures, back pain and stiffness over several months and rash for 2 years. She was later diagnosed with scurvy and osteoporosis. Dietary modifications were instituted together with supplementary vitamin C, supportive treatment with regular dietician review and physiotherapy. Gradual clinical recovery was seen over the course of therapy. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing scurvy even among low-risk populations to ensure prompt and effective clinical management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Vitamin C not only plays a vital role in the maintenance of oxidation–reduction (redox) balance, tyrosine metabolism and carnitine synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but it also affects the treatment outcome of chronic degenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The deficiency of vitamin C, termed as scurvy, is the manifestation of clinical syndrome from its deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In scurvy, small blood vessels become fragile and easily rupture causing small bleeding areas around the hair follicles, known as perifollicular haemorrhage—a tell-tale sign of a severe vitamin C deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Apart from that, vitamin C deficiency also causes alteration in the structural collagen, contributes to defective osteoid matrix formation and leads to an increase in bone resorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In 80% of cases, scurvy manifestations include musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, haemarthrosis or muscular haematomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Radio-imaging may show osteolysis, loss of joint space, osteopenia or periosteal proliferation, with trabecular and cortical osteoporosis being a common observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Our article aims to describe a challenging case of a young lady who presented with recent low-energy spinal fractures in the presence of long-standing diffuse perifollicular papules and perpetual fatigue.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 15-year-old, otherwise healthy, Caucasian girl was referred to us by our orthopaedic colleague for detailed assessment following a T12 wedge fracture caused by a low impact trampoline injury. There were features of osteoporosis and a significantly reduced Z score on a DEXA scan.\n\n【8】She also complained of progressive fatigue with persistent low back pain and back stiffness for the past 8 months. Thoracolumbar X-ray showed widespread biconcave and plate depression over the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae , with minor loss of T9 vertebral body height and minor depression of the superior endplate of T8.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|(A) Widespread biconcave and plate depression over thoracic and lumbar vertebrae  in comparison with (B) normal thoracolumbar lateral X-ray.</u>\n\n【10】Physical examination noted a slim body habitus with mild kyphosis. Her body mass index was 16.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> at third percentile  with a weight of mere 36.2 kg, well below the fourth percentile for her age and height. In view of the multiple wedge-shaped compression fractures throughout the thoracolumbar region on imaging that were likely to be related to significant insufficiency of the endplate, our orthopaedic team has considered the diagnosis of Scheuermann disease, especially in view of other signs to suggest haematological disorder and no prior history of prolonged steroid therapy. She was then referred to a dietician and was given a review appointment.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Body mass index percentile chart.</u>\n\n【12】However, 5 months later, she was readmitted for lethargy with patches of ecchymoses noted over bilateral knees. Examination also revealed perifollicular purpuric macules over bilateral lower limb and forearms , claimed to be present since the past 2 years with no abrupt worsening.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|The figure shows diffuse perifollicular haemorrhages and hyperkeratotic papules on left forearm extensors.</u>\n\n【14】There were no joint swelling, joint tenderness, palpable masses or lymphadenopathies on peripheral examination. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable. Her blood pressure was normal for her age and height with a normal resting heart rate.\n\n【15】Our first clinical impression at that point was autoimmune disorders or vasculitis. An extensive work-up was performed (including serum electrolytes, trace minerals and thyroid function) with equivocal results. Her renal, liver functions, coagulation profile, Vitamin B12 and folate level were within normal limits, and Vitamin D level and iron studies were within acceptable range. Her immunological screening with rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibody came back negative. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 42 mls/h (N:0–20 mls/h) and C-reactive protein was 6 mg/L ( _N_ < 5 mg/L).\n\n【16】A suspicion for scurvy was only established after a detailed dietary history suggested anorexic behaviour of restrictive type since the age of 10. Vitamin C level was sent and subsequently came back undetectable ( _N_ \\= 26–85 umol/L). Her breakfast typically includes two slices of dry toast and plain pasta, with chocolate rice cakes for lunch and tea. She exceptionally lacks red meat, fish, chicken, green vegetables and fruits in her diet. Otherwise, there was no history of prolonged diarrhoea or vomiting, and no history of gastrointestinal diseases in the family. Coeliac disease screening was also negative.\n\n【17】She was prescribed with oral Vitamin C supplement 500 mg daily, ferrous fumarate 1 capsule twice daily (100 mg elemental iron) and calcium carbonate 10 mmol 6 hourly. A referral for psychiatric assessment and psychological services to rule out psychogenic cause of poor dietary habit was made, and she was also seen by a dietician for proper dietary advice and consultation.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】We presented a rare case of symptomatic scurvy in a Caucasian adolescent. The case posed as a diagnostic challenge as scurvy is exceedingly rare in a first world country. Our patient was initially referred due to concerns of anorexia nervosa or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), therefore routine evaluation of vitamin D and calcium level were sent as part of the standard practice. We only sent for vitamin C level when she developed other associated symptoms.\n\n【20】Scurvy is a clinical cutaneous diagnosis presenting with diffuse perifollicular purpura with corkscrew hair in the presence of low Vitamin C level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is a rare nutritional deficiency and is almost forgotten in developed economies; the disease is commonly associated with malabsorption, malnutrition, alcoholism and old age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The normocytic nonregenerative anaemia associated with scurvy is multifactorial, often coupled with iron, vitamin B9 and B12 deficiencies with evidence of systemic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, our case serves as a reminder to the clinicians to be wary of the disease as it is still being sporadically reported. Its clinical appearance can be dramatic, but the disease is readily and completely reversible with restoration of vitamin C levels.\n\n【21】Hence, scurvy should be considered in an appropriate clinical setting, in patients with bleeding tendencies and cutaneous features, after ruling out other haematological conditions. This case highlights that vitamin C deficiency is still relevant in the modern era and raises the need to educate the primary care provider, who are often the first contact, for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research authorship and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study has been registered with the National Medical Research Register of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR-21-1392-60 859).</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication of the case and photographs used was obtained from the legal guardian.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ku Md Saad and Glackin will act as the guarantor for the paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, the urethral polyps would not be considered in the differential diagnosis process by a huge number of physicians, mainly owing to the rarity of documented cases in the medical literature and because of the wide variety of unspecified symptoms the urethral polyp might demonstrate. Urethral polyps are more common in males than in females, and they are usually diagnosed at an early age. Treatment options include transurethral resection, endoscopic suprapubic approach and open surgery. The disease prognosis is excellent as it does not usually recur after being completely removed and the risk of malignant transformation is very low. We are going to report a case of a 3-month-old boy who presented with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis, which revealed the presence of a large posterior urethral polyp.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Urethral polyps are irregular growths that occur in the urethra. They are rare, and they are more common in males than in females. Posterior urethral polyps (PUPs) are more frequent than anterior urethral polyps, which are very rare. John Hunter is credited with the first documented case of urethral polyps in the literature, which he described in an ox in 1763 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, whereas Thompson was the first to report this case in a patient in 1855 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 1899, Neuberger diagnosed the first urethral polyp using an endoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thus far, there has not been a plethora of documented cases about urethral polyps in the medical literature.\n\n【4】PUPs are benign irregular growths in the posterior urethra. Although the lesion is uncommon, it is considered as an important cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Because of its obstructive qualities, there is a wide range of clinical symptoms that include dysuria, recurrent urinary infections, hematuria and urinary retention. Infrequently, urethral polyps may be associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and hydronephrosis and this is what we are going to report in our case.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 3-month-old boy presented with a history of unexplained excessive crying episodes, mostly occur during micturition. On hospital admission, physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies including blood and urine tests were normal, as well. The patient underwent abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, which showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis involving the dilation of the entire ureters . Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed that revealed a moderate VUR on both sides . In addition, a dilation with a filling defect in the prostatic urethra was detected . Cystourethroscopy unfolded a urethral polyp 7.5 <sup>* </sup> 0.5 <sup>* </sup> 0.5 cm in size. The polyp pedicle was attached to the verumontanum ile the polyp extended into the bladder . We also detected a small diverticulum on the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of the lesion was done using endoscopic scissor, and the resescted mass was removed out of the urethra by urethral foreign body forceps . Histopathology examination showed that the lesion is a polyp lined with squamous epithelia and covered with a smooth muscle layer, with no signs of malignancy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Ultra sound imaging showed the hydroureteronephrosis on both sides.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|VCUG imaging was done.

The boy’s parents reported later that the micturition-related crying became significantly less recurrent.\n\n【13】1 year following the surgery, we conducted a new ultrasound and VCUG imaging which affirmed that the VUR and the hydronephrosis fully retreated on both sides . In addition, a follow-up cystoscopy was performed to confirm that there was no recurrence of the polyp.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|VCUG was repeated 1 year after removing the polyp. No filling defect, hydronephrosis nor VUR were detected.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Urethral polyps are uncommon benign polypoid masses of the urethra, and they typically manifest as single tumors rather than multiple separate masses. Until 2004, 181 cases of urethral polyps have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Since then, only a few cases have been found and described in the medical literature. Diagnosing urethral polyps might be difficult and carries a challenging differential diagnosis for clinical practitioners and physicians, because they are infrequent and they could present in a large variety of unspecified symptoms. Urethral polyps are notably more prevalent in males than in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In males, polyps that arise from the posterior urethra are significantly more frequent than anterior urethral polyps, which are rarely described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This entity is extremely rare in females, and it could be located in any part of the urethra without any specific common location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The pathogenesis of this condition is still poorly understood and controversial. However, congenital, irritating, septic, traumatic and obstructive factors have been discussed and proposed as potential causes for urethral polyps. Moore and Kuppusami suggest that maternal estrogen levels during gestation could cause secondary epithelial changes which in turn might develop urethral polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Because the higher portion of cases diagnosed around birth is seen in healthy newborns and most cases are diagnosed in the first decade of life, the congenital theory is considered the most reliable in explaining urethral polyp’s origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Urethral polyps are typically asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, the clinical manifestations are widely diverse and mainly associated with age. In early infancy, intensive crying especially while urinating is the most prominent symptom, whereas older patients often present with hematuria, dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infection and urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In regard with the obstructive characteristics of the lesion, repetitive urine retention and stasis could result in developing VUR and hydronephrosis. The polyp may protrude from the urethral meatus, mainly in females.\n\n【19】Although ultrasound imaging is important in the diagnosing process, it is not diagnostic and cannot detect the lesion successfully in most cases. VCUG assists in establishing diagnosis by showing a filling defect in the urethra and it also reveals accompanying comorbidities like VUR. The presence of urethral polyp is detected mainly by endoscopy and histologically confirmed by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The standard treatment for urethral polyps is endoscopic transurethral resection by either cold knife, scissor, electrocoagulation or laser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The resected polyp should be fully removed and taken out of the urethra, either by foreign body forceps or a stone basket. For polyps with larger sizes, turning the polyp into fragments and the removal of them all using a transurethral approach is the treatment of choice. Open approach surgery is indicated when the transurethral resection or the endoscopic suprapubic approach cannot be done. The urethral polyps prognosis is excellent, as the symptoms usually fully subside after proper management and the tendency of recurrence or malignant degeneration is seldom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The follow-up by doing ultrasonography and VCUG should be done after 1 year.

The treatment of nail psoriasis is essential to improve the health outcomes and quality of life among patients. Pain associated with intralesional injections, inadequate penetration into the nail and underlying tissue, poor adherence to therapy, limited efficacy and recurrent relapses are among the many challenging issues with topical therapy. While conventional systemic therapies are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis. We report a case of nail psoriasis improved with treatment by risankizumab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Psoriasis is a widespread chronic skin condition mediated by the immune system. It affects the skin, nails and joints with systemic involvement and has a major negative impact on the quality of life of affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Psoriasis has a global prevalence of 2% with observed regional variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Psoriasis has various clinical manifestations and subtypes, with psoriasis vulgaris being the most common.

This percentage can reach up to 90% in patients with psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis can impair the quality of life as it may trigger a major social issue, and if left untreated, progress to weaken the nails that can lead to impairment of function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis is challenging to treat and is often resistant to treatment. On the other hand, treating it improves patients’ health outcomes and standard of living 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Nails are known to be epidermal appendages, and are as such, usually affected by psoriasis. Nail disease clinically can involve either the matrix, the nail bed or the periungual tissue, depending on the origin of the inflammatory phase, resulting in distinct injury patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Features such as leukonychia, pitting (punctures or cupuliform depressions), red spots in the lunula and crumbling can result in patients with nail matrix involvement. Onycholysis, salmon or oil-drop patches, subungual hyperkeratosis and splinter hemorrhages may be caused by nail bed involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Psoriasis therapy has advanced tremendously.

He presented with a 2-year history of nail dystrophy and tenderness. It initially involved the left thumb nail then progressed to involve almost all fingernails. Patient denied any history of skin lesions or joint pain. Moreover, no similar history was noted in the family. He visited the primary care clinic where he was diagnosed with onychomycosis based on positive nail culture for candida albicans and treated accordingly with oral terbinafine for 2 weeks then he was given oral fluconazole 300 mg once weekly for 6 weeks. However, no improvement was noted upon follow-up and the patient was referred to dermatology. On examination, bilateral fingernails were found to have trachonychia and longitudinal ridging except the right index and little fingernails . The toenails were clear and no skin or scalp lesions were noted.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Right hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and right hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Left hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and left hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).</u>\n\n【13】A nail biopsy was taken, which showed hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and neutrophils in the nail plate, and came negative for grocott methenamine silver stain .

In addition, during adalimumab therapy, the patient developed cutaneous psoriatic lesions over the extremities following the third dose of adalimumab . He was switched to subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg (at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter).

However, it involved almost all of the fingernails, significantly impairing his quality of life and resulting in significant distress.

Hyperprolactinemia can lead to various different symptoms including anorgasmia. It is important to identify any sexual dysfunction, but also any other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, in elderly patients during medical history taking and not to assume that elderly people are sexually inactive. Anorgasmia and any other sexual dysfunction in elderly can have an impact on their mental health and may even lead to depression and anxiety.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hyperprolactinemia is defined as excessive prolactin levels in the blood. Prolactin is primarily secreted from the anterior pituitary gland. The endocrine function of prolactin is to enable lactation.\n\n【4】In women of reproductive age, hyperprolactinemia may lead to secondary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and infertility. Other symptoms of hyperlactatemia include lactorrhea and anorgasmia. However, the majority of hyperprolactinemia cases remain asymptomatic.\n\n【5】Prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is primarily controlled by hypothalamus. Lactotrophs exhibit D2 receptors, which can be stimulated by dopamine. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion by binding to D2 receptors. Thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of prolactin.\n\n【6】Chest wall irritation (e.g. HZV infection or surgery) can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Other causes include prolactinoma, antipsychotic medication, anti-hypertensive treatment and renal failure amongst others, but some are idiopathic.\n\n【7】The mechanism in which herpes Zoster infection over the chest can cause hyperprolactinemia is by nerve stimulation that leads to prolactin release.\n\n【8】The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia is 0.4% in the general population and most cases are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】CASE\n----\n\n【10】A 98-year-old lady living in a residential home was referred to mental health services by her GP following concerns raised by her carers who reported she was low in mood. Her carers additionally suspected that she was planning on taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets.\n\n【11】The duty mental-health professional who assessed the referral for patient X had conducted a visit to her home. In the assessment, patient X disclosed that she was embarrassed to reveal the reason behind her mental health deterioration, despite this she was willing to talk about it because she wanted to find a solution to her problem. Patient X was started on the antidepressant Mirtazapine for her low mood; however, her mental health did not improve. She reported continuing symptoms that could be attributed to a depressive episode including insomnia, reduced appetite and an inability to relax due to feeling tense all the time.\n\n【12】Patient X revealed that from the time she started developing shingles a few weeks earlier she had been unable to reach orgasm by masturbation, but that she still had intense sexual urges. She explained that her anorgasmia had caused her anxiety and depressed mood. Patient X’s distress had led her to becoming suicidal and to wanting to harm herself by overdosing on tablets or stabbing herself. She was then admitted to an inpatient mental health unit due to her high risk of self-harm.\n\n【13】She was not responding to the antidepressant medication that was started. Her inpatient medical team conducted investigations to identify potential organic causes for patient X’s anorgasmia.\n\n【14】Interestingly, her admission blood tests revealed a raised prolactin level of 1068 ml/u. Her only symptoms attributed to hyperlactatemia were increased facial hair and anorgasmia. She also had pain over her chest which was believed to be due to her herpes zoster infection. There was no lactorrhea or breast engorgement noted on examination.\n\n【15】Recent blood tests indicated that her thyroid function, liver function, kidney function and full blood count were within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan was ordered to exclude a prolactinoma, and this was normal. She also had several physical examinations done of her genital area and pelvis to exclude a herpes infection causing sexual dysfunction. The results of these examinations were unremarkable. On physical examination of her chest, an erythematous rash with blisters was evident over her right breast, extending to her nipples. She also complained of neuropathic pain. The distribution of the rash and clinical picture was in accordance with a recent herpes zoster infection. No Breast mass was detected.\n\n【16】A medication review was made to identify any pharmacological causes of the raised prolactin levels. Patient X was on regular amlodipine for hypertension which is not known to raise prolactin levels. Because of her psychotic symptoms, patient X had been started on aripiprazole, an antipsychotic medication that is not known to cause significant raised prolactin levels (and is sometimes used as an adjunct to lower prolactin levels caused by other antipsychotics that cause raised prolactin).\n\n【17】After conducting the aforementioned investigations for raised prolactin levels, it was concluded that the patient’s hyperprolactinemia was most probably secondary to her recent herpes zoster infection/shingles, which was fairly extensive, involving the patient’s right breast and extending all the way to the nipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As the patient’s herpes infection improved with treatment, patient X’s prolactin levels also normalized gradually and her inability to orgasm resolved.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Doctors should consider the more unique possible causes of the raised prolactin levels when treating a patient with hyperprolactinemia. Any chest wall irritation can cause hyperprolactinemia due to the stimulation reflex. Examples of some of these causes are chest wall trauma, burns, surgery and herpes zoster infection.\n\n【21】It is important to consider elderly patient’s sexual wellbeing, especially if hyperprolactinemia has been detected as this may have a negative impact on their sexual health. One possible cause of sexual dysfunction is hyperprolactinemia and patients with such problems should have their prolactin levels checked. Once hyperprolactinemia is diagnosed, it is important to exclude any pituitary prolactinoma excreting excessive prolactin using MRI brain imaging. Prolactinomas are the commonest types of pituitary tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hyperprolactinemia may be a result of pregnancy, lactation, chest wall stimulation, stress, sleep, epileptic seizures, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal failure amongst other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The patient’s medications should be reviewed as certain medication groups such as antipsychotics, antidepressants as well as antihypertensive medications can cause hyperprolactinemia. Amongst these medication groups, antipsychotics are the primary pharmacological cause of hyperprolactinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is appropriate for clinicians to start psychotic patients with known hyperprolactinemia on antipsychotic medication that have a safer profile when it comes to prolactin levels. The consultant responsible for patient X’s care appropriately chose the second-generation antipsychotic Aripiprazole because of the fact that the prolactin levels are less likely to be affected by this medication.\n\n【24】In patient X’s case, the only explanation remaining for her hyperprolactinemia was the herpes infection across her right breast. The onset of her sexual dysfunction also coincided with the onset of her herpes infection.\n\n【25】The cause of this 98-year-old patient’s mental health deterioration was her anorgasmia, which was a result of hyperprolactinemia caused by irritation to her chest wall from a recent herpes infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I am grateful to staff at Scadbury ward, Oxleas NHS Trust, for their safe and appropriate management of the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval not required.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been gained, and consent form was signed by the patient.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Sarah Moslehi is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Also, we performed EEG that revealed centro-parietal theta rhythmic activity with 2–3 hz generalized waves and spikes, which is a characteristic EEG pattern in infants and children with primary generalized seizures.\n\n【12】However, the child did not exhibit any particular subtype of epilepsy, and since the first incident of seizures, the child took sodium valproate daily with a dosage of 500 mg repeated twice.\n\n【13】On physical examination, the patient was responding well to the examiner. His blood pressure measurement was 90 over 60. His pulse was feeble and rapid. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sustained wide QRS tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia) that mimics a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology in the superior axis, that is, negative QRS in leads II, III and AVF, and positive in lead AVL. The patient was initially given Amiodarone with a loading dose of 5 mg/kg over 20 to 60 minutes repeated twice up to a maximum dose of 15 mg/kg. The patient did not respond well to the initial treatment. Synchronized direct-current (DC) was carried out, which successfully restored sinus rhythm.\n\n【14】Following hemodynamic stability, biochemical testing was performed. Complete blood count (CBC), K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cr and TSH values were normal. On the other hand, 12-lead resting ECG showed multiple abnormalities, including right bundle branch block (RBBB), T-wave inversion and Epsilon waves on precordial leads V1 up to V5. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed structural alteration of the right ventricle (RV) and blood stagnation. More specifically, the parasternal short-axis (PSAX) right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) value was 35 mm, along with regional dyskinesia of RV.\n\n【15】Afterward, the patient was discharged on Amiodarone and Bisoprolol, along with regular monitoring, which revealed progressive structural alteration of the right ventricle on TTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) on ECG  .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|ECG on presentation, showing sustained wide QRS tachycardia (VT) that mimic LBBB morphology in superior axis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|(A) 12 leads ECG after hemodynamic stability.

On physical examination, the patient’s systolic/diastolic blood pressure measurement was 80 to 60. ECG revealed rapid atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) . TTE showed extreme enlargement of the right chambers along with significant tricuspid regurgitation. PSAX RVOT value was 53 mm. The patient was hospitalized. However, he rapidly succumbed to death due to severe right ventricular insufficiency.

However, many patients with ARVC remain clinically silent and asymptomatic for decades, making the disease difficult to recognize, especially in sporadic cases with no documented familial involvement. Moreover, ARVC is characterized by a clinical presentation that includes documented arrhythmia and myocardial structural abnormalities. Meanwhile, the progression of the disease over time and predictors of arrhythmias are still to be defined.\n\n【25】Here, we report a sporadic case of ARVC in a 12-year-old boy who was previously diagnosed with epilepsy. However, there was no documented familial involvement. Very few cases in the literature mention mutations in apparently sporadic ARVC patients whose parents did not exhibit genetic mutations or cardiac manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. In our case and due to the ongoing crisis in Syria, neither the researchers nor the patient had access to genetic testing. Therefore, to screen the family, we were left with performing regular ECG and TTE on the parents and siblings, which showed normal findings.\n\n【26】The diagnostic process involved generating a differential diagnosis to rule out the common causes of palpitations. Blood tests revealed no signs of hyperthyroidism or ion disturbances, which could have caused palpitations. Moreover, the absence of infection and associated symptoms in lab findings and in child’s medical history ruled out myocarditis and Chagas disease. Furthermore, there was no evidence of extracardiac symptoms like lymphadenopathy, shortness of breath or dry, hacking cough and considering the rarity of childhood sarcoidosis, which is most frequently diagnosed between 20 and 29 years of age, we did not consider sarcoidosis as a potential cause. Also, the normal findings on chest X-ray and the absence of any signs of infection in the child or his family members made cardiac tuberculosis unlikely. However, we could not perform a cardiac biopsy as a confirmatory test due to both technical and financial reasons. Furthermore, postmortem myocardial biopsy was not performed as it was against the family’s wishes, which made the exclusion of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis ultimately impossible.\n\n【27】ECG findings ruled out Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and Brugada syndrome. Furthermore, characteristic ECG and TTE findings led us to consider a diagnosis of ARVC according to the modified Task Force Criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Correspondingly, the case presentation satisfied three major and one minor criteria. More specifically, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) mimicking LBBB morphology in superior axis, T-wave inversion that spanned the precordial leads, Epsilon waves on precordial leads and PSAX RVOT ≥32 to <36 mm along with RV dyskinesia on TTE were all recognized. Therefore, we decided on a diagnosis of ARVC.\n\n【28】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation was planned due to the progressive structural alteration of RV, as was reflected by TTE and ECG findings during follow-up. However, the rapid progression of the disease from the first onset of symptoms to severe right heart failure over the course of only one year, along with the surrounding circumstances in Syria imposed by the ongoing crisis, made an ICD implantation infeasible, for both financial and logistic reasons.\n\n【29】Finally, considering that cardiovascular side effects of sodium valproate are reported in 1–5% of the patients, which include hypertension, tachycardia and palpitations, we think that sodium valproate could have introduced potential risks in this patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】To our knowledge, this is a rare case of ARVC in which the condition manifested sporadically and was complicated by rapid progression, and unfortunate fatal deterioration, in a patient who was previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Thus, we recommend immediate primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmias in ARVC patients, and to take in consideration of the potential risks of using sodium valproate in these patients.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to extend our sincere thanks to Dr. Abdullah Assani.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no funding sources.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the child for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

We present a case of a 44-year-old gentleman with a history of blunt chest trauma who presented with constrictive pericarditis with right-sided heart failure. Imaging studies revealed a calcified pericardium. He underwent an uneventful pericardiectomy. Calcification is common yet rare if it involves the pericardium. It normally occurs following fibrosis and adhesion which are associated with the chronicity of the disease, hence creating more challenge to the operating surgeon in the pericardiectomy procedure.\n\n【2】constrictive pericarditis , right heart failure , calcified pericardium\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Pericardial calcification (PC) usually develops after trauma or chronic pericarditis. In developing countries, the primary cause of PC is tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Other factors namely chronic idiopathic pericarditis, post-cardiac surgery and mediastinal irradiation are among the aetiologies that can lead to the formation of calcified pericardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is important to differentiate either the calcification is dystrophic or malignant as the former is benign and more common than the later. Constrictive pericarditis can be caused by PC. It is a treatable disease with poor prognosis if it is left untreated. The clinicians therefore need to have a high alert for this condition if they encounter a patient with symptoms of predominant right heart failure especially in a patient with a history of cardiac surgery, pericarditis or pericardial effusion as well as chest trauma. In this case report, we highlight our first experience in managing a case of constrictive pericarditis that was presented with severe PC and discuss our approach.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 44-year-old gentleman with no underlying medical illness presented with worsening symptoms of heart failure over the past 2 years. The symptoms mainly restricted his effort tolerance such as climbing stairs and walking a great distance. It was also associated with bilateral leg swelling and abdominal distension. Otherwise, he denied any chest pain, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.\n\n【7】He revealed a history of a high-impact motor vehicle accident (MVA) about 7 years ago. As a result, he sustained blunt chest trauma after his chest had been knocked onto the steering wheel. He otherwise did not have any other injuries. Post-MVA, he claimed to feel some chest discomfort but did not seek any treatment as it was tolerable.\n\n【8】He was well until 2 years ago when he started to feel some restrictions in his daily activities especially when climbing up stairs. The symptoms had worsened over time and he started to develop occasional bilateral leg swelling and abdominal distension. Due to the unresolved symptoms, he sought treatment at a general practitioner and was started on anti-failure medications. Since the symptoms were not fully resolved with oral medications, he was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. From the imaging studies , he was noted to have a calcified pericardium, hence a constrictive pericarditis with calcified pericardium was diagnosed. Electrocardiogram at diagnosis revealed a sinus rhythm with T inversion at lead II, III, aVF and V2–V6 . ECHO revealed an ejection fraction of 68% with mild MR and TR. There was no diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac angiogram subsequently was normal with no LAD bridging.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiograph showing crescent-shaped calcified rim along cardiac borders (arrow) implicating PC.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|An axial view of CT scan showing PC involving bilateral atria and ventricles.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with T inversion at leads II, III, aVF and V2–V6.</u>\n\n【12】He was later counselled to our cardiothoracic unit, where a decision to perform a pericardiectomy was taken. Through this procedure, it aimed to remove part of the calcified pericardium in order to release the heart from the confined space of calcified pericardium. The surgery was performed via open median sternotomy to approach his calcified pericardium . An off-pump anterior pericardiectomy which is phrenic to phrenic pericardial stripping was performed . Histopathological examination showed a thickened fibrocartilagenous tissue of the pericardium with no inflammation or granuloma formation. Post-operatively, he developed wound dehiscence which was later closed by secondary suturing. Otherwise, he made an uneventful recovery.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|(A) Open median sternotomy revealing a whitish, hardened calcified pericardium suggestive of PC. (B) Anterior pericardiectomy in which phrenic to phrenic pericardial stripping was performed.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Calcified pericardium normally indicates the chronicity of constrictive pericarditis. It is important to treat patients with this condition as it will cause cardiac diastolic dysfunction that manifest as cardiac failure symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Any patient with shortness of breath, elevated jugular venous pulse, pedal oedema and ascites should be evaluated for constrictive pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It happens as the heart is being encased by a non-pliable and rigid pericardium secondary to dense adhesion and fibrosis. The PC usually occurs around the right atrium, anterior right ventricle and diaphragmatic surface; however, the atrioventricular groove is the most common site of involvement mainly due to lower pressure and gravitation influence in the pericardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】PC is easily detected from chest radiography or computed tomography by showing a curvilinear calcification that normally forms on the right side of the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Transthoracic echocardiography also is able to visualize the presence of calcified pericardium and measures the pericardial thickness. Other features include a small ventricle with deviated septum due to rapid diastolic filling effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Pericardiectomy is the only option to treat patients with symptoms of constrictive pericarditis which will result in improvement or normalization of the cardiac function in the majority of cases after releasing the restricted heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The aim of pericardiectomy procedure is to remove the calcified or fibrotic pericardium as much as possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The presence of calcified pericardium, which invades the myocardium, will increase the technical difficulty in removing the disease pericardium. Pericardiectomy can be achieved via median sternotomy, anterior thoracotomy or left anterolateral thoracotomy approaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The extent of total pericardiectomy is usually performed between two phrenic nerves and from the great vessels to the basal aspect of the heart. However, the long-term survival of patients undergoing pericardiectomy is dependent on the aetiology of disease that leads to the constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【18】In conclusion, as in our patient, the history of blunt chest trauma might be the contributing factor to his current illness that required him to undergo pericardiectomy. He showed good progress following his surgery as reported in others series of patients undergoing the pericardiectomy procedure.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required for this report.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

A 21-year old man visited outpatient clinic to treat previously diagnosed hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. Despite daily 150 mcg of levothyroxine supplement, thyroid-stimulating hormone level was elevated, but thyroid autoantibodies were not detected. He showed features of Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy and elevated serum PTH level with normal albumin-corrected calcium and phosphorus level. The Ellsworth-Howard test proved the blunted response of urinary phosphorus and cyclic adenosine monophosphate after the infusion of the exogenous PTH, suggesting PTH resistance. DNA analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation in the _GNAS_ gene (c.478C > T). Herein, we report a case of PHP type 1a confirmed by clinical, biochemical and molecular analyses. Establishing correct diagnosis of PHP is necessary for efficient therapeutic management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare disorder that shares the biochemical features of hypoparathyroidism such as hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, owing to the resistance of target tissue to the biological actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. PHP consists of five variants, namely 1a, 1b, 1c, 2 and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism—which are based on pathogenesis and phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

We report on an adult patient with PHP type 1a who had an unusual presentation of primary hypothyroidism since childhood.\n\n【4】### Case report\n\n【5】Hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency had been diagnosed in our 21-year-old male patient when he was 9 years old because of his stunted growth. Physical examination found short stature (154.7 cm; normal range > 160), overweight (body mass index of 25.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; normal range = 18.5–24.9) and a round face, even as an adult . His teeth were pigmented, suggestive of enamel hypoplasia, and brachydactyly, with short metacarpals and metatarsals , were observed. His sexual maturity rating was Tanner stage 5, and he did not have any psychomotor symptoms. Radiographs revealed short fourth and fifth metacarpals and metatarsals on both hands and feet . Bone mineral density was normal. Computed tomography showed no sign of brain calcinosis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Albright hereditary osteodystrophy features of our patient (short stature, overweight and a round face).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Brachydactyly with short metacarpals and metatarsals.</u>\n\n【8】Laboratory results showed normal albumin-corrected calcium and phosphorus, elevated serum PTH (101.6 pg/ml; normal range = 15.0–65.0), normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25.5 ng/dL; normal range = 10.0–30.0) and normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (100 ml/min/1.73m <sup>2 </sup> ; normal range > 60). Among bone turnover markers, serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen was slightly elevated (0.94 ng/ml; normal range = 0.016–0.584), whereas osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels were normal. The patient had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (6.5 μIU/ml; normal range = 0.35–4.94) from taking 150 mcg of levothyroxine, but had no goiter or thyroid autoantibodies. He had a slightly elevated prolactin level (23.7 ng/ml; normal range = 4.1–18.4), but normal levels of free T4, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, serum testosterone, adrenocorticotropin, cortisol, IGF-1 and growth hormone . Finally, we used the Ellsworth-Howard test to determine the PHP type . The responses of urinary phosphorus and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were markedly attenuated after the infusion of the exogenous PTH (40 μg; teriparatide; IN, USA) as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Results of the Ellsworth-Howard test: U1, urine 2 h before teriparatide injection; U2, urine 1 h before teriparatide injection; U3, urine at teriparatide injection; U4, urine 1 h after teriparatide injection; U5, urine 2 h after teriparatide injection.

To support the diagnosis, we performed DNA analysis of the guanine nucleotide (GTP)-binding α-subunit gene ( _GNAS_ ). Sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA fragments of _GNAS_ detected a heterozygous missense mutation within exon 6 (c.478C > T) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Active vitamin D metabolites with calcium carbonate were administered and the levothyroxine was maintained. After 18 months of treatment, his PTH level had decreased to within the normal range (59.1 pg/ml; normal range = 15.0–65.0) with normocalcemia. Thyroid function tests, including a TSH level, were also normal.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】PHP type 1a is an uncommon genetic disorder characterized by the association between resistance to multiple hormones and AHO features. The most clinically evident abnormality in PHP type 1a is PTH resistance, which presents as hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and an elevated serum PTH level preceding hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with normocalcemia as an adult; however, he had been taking calcium and vitamin D since he was 9 years old. Some patients with PHP type 1a remain normocalcemic throughout their life despite PTH resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Resistance to TSH is frequently accompanied by PTH resistance, and both of which clinically manifest during childhood or adolescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Goiter and antithyroid antibodies are usually absent, as was the case in our patient. Mild TSH resistance due to heterozygous TSH receptor variants suggests that thyroxine may be dispensable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> because the circulating TSH elevation would compensate for the mild refractoriness in thyroid cells.\n\n【15】Resistance to PTH can be confirmed via the Ellsworth-Howard test because affected individuals have reduced urinary cAMP and phosphate excretion in response to the exogenous administration of biologically active PTH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, clinical guidelines now indicate that performing the Ellsworth-Howard test is not necessary but might be helpful in research settings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Instead, a molecular test crucially confirms the clinical diagnosis and allows the categorization of the condition of a patient as a subtype of PHP, which can guide management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although the same missense mutation of the _GNAS_ gene (c.478C > T) in our patient had been reported in a patient with AHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, it was the first time reported in Korean patients with PHP. Because PHP type 1a is caused by maternally inherited inactivating _GNAS_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, we assumed that the mother or maternal family may transmit the genetic defect. However, our patient’s family could not undergo genetic testing because he had been raised in an orphanage and no record of familial relations was found at the time of this study.\n\n【16】The long-term therapy for hypocalcemia in patients with PHP needs active vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol) or analogues (alfacalcidol) and oral calcium supplements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The current treatment approach is to reduce the serum PTH level to the upper normal limit to avoid suppressing PTH, which can lead to hypercalciuria and renal calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Associated endocrinopathies, particularly hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism, when present, should be treated with levothyroxine, sex hormones or growth hormone. Prospective clinical trials focusing on the management and outcomes of treatment for PHP have not been conducted because of the rarity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusion, we report a case of PHP type 1a confirmed by clinical, biochemical and molecular analyses. Patients with PHP have various endocrinopathies from early childhood to adulthood, which yield a highly heterogeneous clinical picture. Early interventions and multidisciplinary follow-up are necessary for efficient therapeutic management of PHP type 1a.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board 通用删除1(英):<u>(IRB No. 2021–08-023)</u>.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ho Yeon Chung.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Oxygen saturation of 85% under room air was documented. There were associated subcostal recession and rapid breathing of more than 70 breaths per minute. The attending physician was not able to pass a 6 Fr feeding tube into the nasal cavity during routine suction. Oxygen saturation improved after the patient was supported with non-invasive ventilation. On physical examination, the child did not have any midline effects, hypotelorism, microcephaly, ocular abnormalities or simian crease. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT image in bone window at the level of the paranasal sinuses showing narrowed pyriform aperture stenosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT image in bone window at the level of the superior alveolar ridge shows solitary median maxillary central incisor (solid arrow, A) and a narrow triangular hard palate (dashed arrows, A). Coronal CT image showing a bony ridge at the inferior surface of the hard palate (B).</u>\n\n【10】CNPAS was suspected and an unenhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses was arranged. Narrowing of the pyriform aperture is the hallmark of CNPAS. CT scan demonstrated bilateral medial displacement of the nasal prominences resulting in extremely narrow nasal passages measuring 6 mm in width . There was an associated solitary median maxillary central incisor with a narrow triangular hard palate . Coronal reformatted CT images revealed a bony ridge along the inferior surface of the hard palate .\n\n【11】The child was treated with non-invasive respiratory support, regular suctioning and room air humidification. The child responded well to the conservative management and was discharged after 10 days. MRI was not performed due to restrictions brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the delivery and initial hospital admission. Subsequent follow-up under both paediatric otolaryngology as well as general paediatric clinics was planned.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Embryologically, the nasal grooves from the mesodermal layer are transformed into nasal pits in the first 8 weeks after conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Between the 8th and 24th week, the nasal pits are filled with epithelial tissue which then gets resorbed in normal development. Insufficient resorption of the epithelial plug leads to the formation of prominent nasal processes of the maxilla, resulting in a narrowed pyriform aperture. The reduction in the cross-section area at the pyriform aperture results in a significant increase in the resistance of the nasal passage. Consequently, the neonate needs to exert more effort for respiration.\n\n【14】By consensus, a pyriform aperture width of less than 11 mm is considered diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. CT scan of the paranasal sinuses is the most helpful modality to assess the nasal passage in neonates. First described in 1989, CNPAS can present as a sporadic anomaly or as part of solitary median maxillary central incisor syndrome (SMMCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As such, additional cross-sectional imaging (MRI) also plays an important role in identifying associated nasal anomalies (such as nasoethmoid encephaloceles), congenital brain anomalies (holoprosencephaly) and ocular defects (coloboma).\n\n【15】In our case, a routine examination by the paediatric retrieval team shortly after birth revealed signs of laboured breathing and impending respiratory distress. Routine nasal suctioning plays an important role in clearing the nasal passageway as well as providing a means of determining the presence and location of any possible airway obstruction. In CNPAS, the suction tube will invariably meet resistance after being inserted 2–4 mm into the nostrils, making further advancement impossible.\n\n【16】CNPAS should be distinguished from choanal atresia, which is the narrowing and obstruction of the posterior nasal airways by a bony or membranous septum. The clinical presentation of CNPAS and choanal atresia can be very similar as both cause subcostal recession, tachypnea and cyanosis. However, a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses provides adequate information to distinguish between the two conditions as the management approaches for each condition differ significantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Neonates with choanal atresia invariably need surgical intervention ranging from transnasal puncture, transpalatal repair, transnasal endoscopic repair and post-operative stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conversely, patients with CNPAS can be managed conservatively or with surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Conservative management is preferred when the neonate can maintain good oxygen saturation without signs of respiratory distress. In such cases, meticulous nasal hygiene and suctioning, application of adrenaline saline solution and room air humidification have shown to be effective treatment measures. Non-invasive respiratory support is given during this time and gradually tapered down. Severe CNPAS requires rhinoplasty which entails surgical widening of the nasal passage and the insertion of stents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Surgical intervention is also considered when non-invasive treatment does not help resolve the patient’s symptoms. The presence of associated craniofacial anomalies is the main cause of surgical treatment failure in approximately 14% of patients in one relatively sizeable study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. CNPAS is a condition that tends to improve as the child grows with an excellent prognosis. Even when initial surgery was inadequate, no recurrence has been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Prompt diagnosis and adequate respiratory support are crucial for neonates with CNPAS. Delay in initiating appropriate treatment puts the child at risk of respiratory distress and apnea which, in severe cases, may lead to ischemic brain injury and death. Diagnosis is made using an unenhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses with a pyriform aperture measuring less than 11 mm. Imaging also plays an important role in identifying associated craniofacial dysmorphism, which may affect treatment outcomes.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia for permission to publish this report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have no funding source to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Yong Guang Teh.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Universiti Malaysia Sabah.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A life-threatening and potentially fatal manifestation of thyrotoxicosis is thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is considered rare with an occurrence rate of 1–2% of all patients with hyperthyroidism, making a high index of suspicion important in the early recognition of this debilitating complication. We present the case of a 63-year-old female with a significant history of being non-compliant with her hyperthyroidism regimen and presented to the emergency department in severe respiratory distress. She was ultimately diagnosed with thyroid storm induced high-output congestive heart failure, intubated, had a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the intensive care unit in a guarded condition. Her hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged on Day 12.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】The most common underlying etiology of a thyroid storm is Grave’s disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyrotropin receptor antibodies. As an endocrine emergency and sepsis mimic, thyroid storm becomes a must recognize disease process, with an untreated mortality of 100% and 10–50% with treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of thyroid storm is diverse, presents within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis and requires a multifactorial treatment regimen. As a severe hypermetabolic condition, thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician.\n\n【4】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) in severe respiratory distress. She stated, ‘I had asthma as a kid, this kind of feels like that.’ Symptoms started abruptly 2 days ago while she was leaving her house to go shopping and continued to progressively get worse. Associated symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic chest pain, diaphoresis and lightheadedness. She denied any recent travel, hormone replacement, prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, calf pain/leg pain or any other symptoms. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure 220/114 mmHg, respiratory rate up to 42 breaths/min, heart rate of 124 beats/min and a pulse ox of 88% on a non-rebreather. Physical exam was notable for severe respiratory distress and diaphoresis with conversational dyspnea, intercostal retractions and supraclavicular retractions. The patient was not wanting to talk or move secondary to the shortness of breath. Examination of the head and neck revealed no evidence for proptosis; however, she did exhibit fullness to her thyroid bilaterally. Her cardiopulmonary exam revealed diffuse rales in all lung fields and no obvious murmur. Her lower extremities were significant for 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure on arrival, a high dose nitroglycerine infusion was started and furosemide was given. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus tachycardia at 119 with biatrial enlargement. Chest radiography, Fig. 1 , shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n【7】Blood pressure improved to 170/70 mmHg, and the patient was able to communicate regarding her medical history. She noted intermittent palpitations for over 1 year, decreased appetite, an unintentional 10-lb weight loss and blurry vision. Chart review revealed that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level performed as an outpatient 2 months prior returning a value of <0.01. At that time, a thyroid ultrasound was performed and was concerning for a solid right thyroid nodule measuring up to 1.8 cm. A subsequent technetium thyroid study revealed a goiter with increased technetium trapping consistent with the clinical suspicion of Graves’ disease. The patient had refused radioiodine therapy. She was prescribed methimazole and propranolol as an outpatient, but missed multiple doses frequently.\n\n【8】Within 5 minutes of arrival, she began to decompensate, with increasing diaphoresis, tachypnea, hypoxia, bradycardia and lethargy. Decision was thus made to intubate utilizing etomidate and rocuronium. Subsequent chest radiography post intubation, Fig. 2 , shows a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. Approximately 4 minutes later, her rhythm went from bradycardic into asystole. Advanced cardiac life support protocol was followed, with a resulting return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 5 minutes. Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion or right heart strain. CT angiography of the chest, Figs 3 and 4 , shows no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography post intubation showing a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n【12】Laboratory evaluation was notable for a TSH <0.01 (0.40–4.50 mcIU/ml), free T3 of 10.2 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml), free T4 of 2.7 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL), brain natriuretic peptide of 566 (0–100 pg/ml), troponin of 0.01/0.12/0.24 (0.00–0.04 ng/ml) and blood glucose of 210. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 89, p02 345, HCO3 23. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable. No other acute lab abnormalities were found.\n\n【13】The case was discussed with endocrinology and she was started on the following regimen: propranolol 1 mg IV followed by 60 mg PO every 6 hours via her nasogastric tube, methimazole 20 mg loading dose followed by 20 mg every 6 hours, SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral Solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours, hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours and cholestyramine powder 4 gm via NG tube q6 hours. The patient was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition for suspected high output congestive heart failure secondary to thyroid storm from a non-compliance with her hyperthyroidism treatment. The elevated troponin was deemed likely a type II mechanism related to hypoxia, bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【14】By Day 2, the patient was alert on the ventilator, answering yes or no questions and doing well on spontaneous breathing trials. A formal 2D echocardiography showed mild eccentric mitral regurgitation, trace pulmonic insufficiency, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. By Day 5, she was transferred out of the ICU. By Day 7, her free T3 was approaching normal at 2.1 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml) and her free T4 normalized at 2.4 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL). It will take several weeks for the TSH to return to normal. Her remaining hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on Day 12. She later underwent radioactive iodine ablation as an outpatient. There will likely be a need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy once the patient develops an underactive thyroid. At her most recent endocrinology follow-up appointment, she remains compliant, has had a full return to baseline activities and enjoys spending time with her family.\n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Thyroid storm is a severe hypermetabolic condition resulting in increased sensitivity and expression of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to a higher response to endogenous catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are number of causes, including, but not limited to the following: medical non-compliance, untreated thyroid disease, trauma, myocardial ischemia, infection, overdose of thyroid hormone and diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our patient, her thyroid storm was secondary to medical non-compliance with her hyperthyroid medication and non-compliance with the recommended radioactive iodine treatment.\n\n【17】For the emergency physician, laboratory evaluation will reveal a TSH that is usually low or undetectable with an associated elevated T3 and T4. Other laboratory findings can include anemia, lower serum creatinine, hypercalcemia or thrombocytopenia. If adrenal insufficiency is also present, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation is extremely diverse, with similarities to a hyperadrenergic state, with multiple systems being affected.\n\n【18】*   Central nervous system manifestations (altered mental status, seizures, agitation, lethargy, psychosis and coma)\n\n【19】*   Cardiovascular manifestations (sinus tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chest pain, wide pulse-pressure and dyspnea on exertion)\n\n【20】*   Gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea)\n\n【21】*   Skin manifestations (flushed, warm, moist and possible vitiligo and hyperpigmentation)\n\n【22】*   Thyroid gland manifestations (diffuse enlargement, neck fullness and thyroid tenderness)\n\n【23】As the disease process progresses, excess amounts of thyroid hormone begin to have a significant impact on cardiovascular hemodynamics. The result is high-output congestive heart failure (an uncommon type of heart failure) as the cardiac tissue has an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. Characteristic features of a high-output congestive heart failure include an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. In this particular form of heart failure, the increased cardiac output is greater than the metabolic demand. Patients will present with an increased stroke volume, increased myocardial contractility, increased ejection fraction, atrial arrhythmia and systolic hypertension with an associated wide pulse pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If left untreated, the result is eventual dilated cardiomyopathy, lethal dysrhythmias and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This concept of high-output congestive heart failure is counterintuitive to the typical congestive heart failure secondary to other causes, such as a myocardial infarction, that results in decreased myocardial contractility, low cardiac output and ventricular arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Being within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis, distinguishing severe thyrotoxicosis from thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician. One set of diagnostic criteria that can be used to aid in diagnosing thyroid storm is the Burch-Wartofsky Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Components include the degree of fever, tachycardia, presence of atrial fibrillation, presence of congestive heart failure, any gastrointestinal dysfunction and any central nervous system dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A score greater than 45 points is diagnostic of thyroid storm, 25–44 points is associated with an impending thyroid storm and <25 points is unlikely. Our patient received 10 points for a fever of 101.2°F, 15 points for a heart rate of 124 beats/min, 20 points for congestive heart failure and 10 points for agitation, for a total score of 55 points. Another diagnostic aid that can be utilized in diagnosing thyroid storm are the criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association (presence of thyrotoxicosis in addition to at least one central nervous system dysfunction in combination with fever, CHF, tachycardia or gastrointestinal abnormality) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Treatment is multifactorial and involves a specific order to the treatment regimen as outlined below.\n\n【26】1.  Beta blocker is used to block the peripheral effects of the thyroid hormones and prevent the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is used for this reason to treat the systemic effects (starting dose is often 1 mg IV push, titrating 1–3 mg q10 minutes and PO formulations dosed at 60–80 mg q6 hours) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In our patient, she received 1 mg IV of propranolol and started on a PO formulation.\n\n【27】2.  Administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole is utilized to inhibit the _de novo_ synthesis of T3 and T4. PTU is typically given as a 600–1000 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg q6. Methimazole is typically given as a 20–30 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 20–30 mg q6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】3.  Administration of SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours or Lugol’s solution 4–8 gtts q6 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These will block the release of pre-formed thyroid hormones.\n\n【29】4.  Administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours or Dexamethasone 2–4 mg q6 hours) as thyroid storm causes depression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis. In addition, corticosteroids have the ability inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】5.  Administration of cholestyramine powder (4 g PO q6 hours) aids in reducing thyroid hormone levels by interfering with anterior hepatic circulation and recycling of thyroid hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Definitive treatment often post-hospitalization involves surgery or radioactive iodine, as our patient had received. The Journal of Clinical Apheresis published an article in 2018 regarding patients that cannot undergo thyroidectomy or fail pharmacotherapy. In these patients, plasma exchange has been suggested as another treatment option; however, the optimal role is not established and there are only a limited number of cases within the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】To decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with thyroid storm, an emergency medicine physician must consider this diagnosis in any patient presenting to the ED in a hypermetabolic state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common cause of death in thyroid storm is cardiopulmonary failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As a result, quick recognition and treatment is critical for patient survival.\n\n【33】Conflict of interest\n--------------------\n\n【34】None declared.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support was received for this study.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.T. is the guarantor of this study.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Patients with this syndrome may also have adermatoglyphia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis, and acral dorsal nonscarring blisters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Very few occurrences have been reported in the literature but none of the cases presented with beard alopecia, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first case of this extremely rare syndrome reported from Syria.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 38-year-old Syrian man presented to the Dermatology department at Tishreen University Hospital with main complaint of multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard associated with diffuse brown reticulate hyperpigmentation. The patient was born to Syrian second-degree relatives with no family history of similar disorder. However, he had a cousin who was born with the same symptoms. The patient had normal physical, social and mental development without prominent medical, surgical or drug history.\n\n【7】On examination, the reticulate hyperpigmentation involved the neck, trunk, extremities  and was more obvious on axilla  and palms . It began at birth and became severe in adulthood; the intensity of hyperpigmentation slightly decreased at the age of 30 but remained present. The oral mucosa was not affected, no oral leukoplakia or pallor. No dental abnormalities were found. Scalp and body hair was thin since childhood. No eyebrow, axillary or pubic hair loss was noted. Nine months ago he developed multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard . The hair pull test was negative. The morphology of the hair shaft was normal on clinical and microscopic examination. Onychodystrophy of many fingernails and toenails was found, it started at 13 years of age then the fingernails improved during the last 10 years while the dystrophy of toenails became worse . Nail clipping for fungus and a fungal culture were negative. There was a history of hyperhidrosis along with hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints over fingers and toes .There was not palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or acral dorsal nonscarring blisters.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Reticulate hyperpigmentation on neck, trunk and extremities.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Reticulate hyperpigmentation on axilla.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Reticulate hyperpigmentation on palms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Onychodystrophy of many fingernails and toenails.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 6**|删除段之间换行|Hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 7**|删除段之间换行|Hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints.</u>\n\n【15】Neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, auditory and visual examination was normal.

We could not conduct genetic phenotyping because it is not available.\n\n【16】Histopathological examination of skin biopsy revealed unremarkable epidermis. Scattered variable numbers of melanophages in the papillary dermis  and pigment incontinence with marked tendency of melanophages to be situated around blood vessels (perivascular melanophages) . Melanophages showed both spindle and epithelioid morphology with some particularly; large forms contain prominent coarse melanin granules , adnexal structures were absent.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 8**|删除段之间换行|Unremarkable epidermis and melanophages in papillary dermis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 9**|删除段之间换行|Perivascular localization of spindle and epithelioid melanophages.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 10**|删除段之间换行|Some large melanophages showing prominent coarse melanin granules.</u>\n\n【20】Topical minoxidil 5% has not been shown to be effective for beard alopecia.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】DPR is a rare autosomal dominant pigmentary dermatosis caused by mutations in the KRT14 gene located on chromosome 17 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. Since first described by Hauss and Oberste-Lehn in 1958 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, DPR has been acknowledged as a very rare disorder with approximately 21 reported cases among the regions of America, Europe and Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is characterized by a triad of diffused reticulate hyperpigmentation, nonscarring alopecia that may include the scalp, eyebrows or axillary hair and onychodystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of DPR can be made clinically based on the previous triad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Other associated features include: hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis, acral dorsal nonscarring blisters, adermatoglyphia and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>. The reticular pigmentation of DPR occurs at birth or in early childhood on the trunk, neck and proximal limps, it presents throughout life without spontaneous fading.\n\n【23】Other diseases fall under the category of reticulated pigmentary disorders that should be considered and excluded are: Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadasson syndrome (NFJS), Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC), Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditary (DUH), Dowling-Degos disease, reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura, acromelanosis progressiva and hereditary symmetric dyschromatosis of Dohi.\n\n【24】NFJS is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndrome manifested with poorly developed dermatoglyphics, onychodystrophy, abnormal sweating, and palmoplantar keratoderma. It is distinguished by reticulate hyperpigmentation that fades after puberty, and severe dental anomalies leading to early dental loss which does not correlate to the manifestations of our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】DKC is an x-linked disease characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation, nail dystrophy, adermatoglyphia and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Other features of DKC mainly include bone marrow failure, oral leukoplakia and abnormal dental findings. However, our patient did not show any of these features thus DKC was excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditary is a rare genodermatosis characterized by small irregular hyper-and hypopigmented macules present in early childhood on the trunk and extremities but palms and soles usually are not involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This dyschromatosis is associated with high-tone deafness that was not present in this case.\n\n【27】Dowling-Degos disease or reticulate pigmented dermatosis of the flexures was also excluded as it presents in adult life where distinct distribution of pigmentation in the flexural areas (groin, axillae and inframammary), facial pits and perioral scars are found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】While in reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura, acromelanosis progressiva and hereditary symmetric dyschromatosis of Dohi, hyperpigmented macules can be observed especially on the dorsal aspect of the hands and feet in a reticular pattern.\n\n【29】Based on previous studies, it is the first time that we report a DPR patient with beard alopecia which suggests that nonscarring alopecia in DPR may include other sites of the body not just the scalp, eyebrows or axillary hair.\n\n【30】Histologically, some distinctive features such as perivascular localization of spindle and epithelioid melanophages with some large forms containing prominent coarse melanin granules were noted in our case.\n\n【31】Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for DPR but we can manage some cutaneous distress such as palmoplantar keratoderma by keratolytic and topical retinoids.\n\n【32】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【33】DPR is a very rare disorder usually misdiagnosed but it should be taken into account when seeing the triad of generalized reticulate hyperpigmentation, nonscarring alopecia and onychodystrophy.

Therefore, correlation with future reported cases will be required.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are grateful for Bardisan Gawrieh, Pediatric Surgery Department, Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria; Mariana Haydar, Department of pediatrics, Pediatrics and Obstetrics Hospital, Lattakia, Syria, for their valuable support.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of Interest statement._ No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and the figures related to it.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Lama Elias.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

EDS is classified into 13 subtypes according to the most recent classification. These subtypes are clinically and genetically heterogenous. The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (spEDS) is caused by homozygous mutations in B4GALT7, B3GALT6 and SLC39A13. To date, 13 individuals with molecularly diagnosed SLC39A13-related spEDS have been reported. The spEDS caused by biallelic pathogenic SLC39A13 variants are characterized by short stature, protuberant eyes with bluish sclera, finely wrinkled palms, hypermobile joints, hyperextensible skin and characteristic radiological findings. Herein, we report a case of 7-year-old-female child with spEDS associated with novel homozygous (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) missense variation of the SLC39A13 gene.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is classified into 13 subtypes according to the 2017 international classification. The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (spEDS) is caused homozygous mutations in _B4GALT7_ , _B3GALT6_ and _SLC39A13._ We report a case of 7-year-old-female child with spEDS associated with novel gene missense mutation in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene. She presented with the classical features of spEDS.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】We report a case of 7-year-old-female child diagnosed with spEDS. She was second birth by order, born of third degree consanguineous marriage at full-term gestation by lower segment caesarean section in view of breech presentation. The antenatal course was uneventful. Her birth weight and length were normal. Megalocornea with a horizontal corneal diameter of 13 mm and vertical corneal diameter of 12.5 mm (normal horizontal corneal diameter range is 11.5–12 mm and vertical corneal diameter range is 10.5–11 mm; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>) and blue sclerae  were noticed at birth, however the neonatal period was uneventful. She was constantly under surveillance for vision affection, but had no visual impairment on follow-up. On routine developmental surveillance and screening at 9 months of age, child was found to have hypotonia, with gross motor delay (DQ—55), with normal deep tendon reflexes and no postural abnormality. Neurological examination did not reveal any abnormal findings apart from hypotonia. Other domains of development were satisfactory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain done for evaluation of hypotonia and motor delayat 10 months revealed abnormal T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense signals noted involving the bilateral peritrigonal and frontal white matter and bilateral centrum semi-ovale, showing no diffusion restriction or foci of blooming, features suggestive of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Occupational therapy and physiotherapy were instituted for hypotonia. Child was followed up and on regular development surveillance, gradual improvement in motor milestones was noted. After an interval of 3 years of lost to follow up, she presented at 7 years with complaints of gait abnormality, hypermobile joints and short stature. The motor delay noted in infancy was not evident now and she had normal development on assessment scales. On physical examination, child had proportionate short stature with height of 105 cm (−2 standard deviation \\[SD\\] to −3 SD) , with a mid-parental height of 156.5 cm (between 0 and −2SD) and weight of 15.02 kg (−2 SD to −3 SD; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>). She was found to mild hypotonia leading to waddling gait. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. The physical examination at the time was also significant for hypermobile joints  (Beighton score—8), hyperextensible skin (skin could be stretched to 2.8 cm on volar surface of forearm and to 1.5 cm on volar surface of palm), finely wrinkled palms  and pes planus. There was no evidence of scars or ecchymosis. Megalocornea, which was noticed at birth had similar dimensions at this age and was of non-progressive variant and did not cause any visual impairment. No other family member demonstrated similar phenotype. When evaluated for short stature, the systemic screening and thyroid function tests were done, which was normal. Her bone age was of 6 years and height age was of 4 years age at age of 7 years. She was evaluated for short stature-systemic screening including complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, liver and renal function tests, urine analysis, stool analysis and celiac screening were done, which were normal. Karyotype was 46XX. The findings of neuroimaging done at 7 years of age were similar to MRI done at 10 months of age with no progression of white matter changes .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Short stature, height 105 cm (< −2 SD) at 7 years age.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Protuberant eyes with megalocornea and bluish sclera.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Finely wrinkled palms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Hyperextensible joint.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Cervical spine with platyspondyly.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|X-ray pelvis with small ilia.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|MRI imaging of the child showing metachromatic leukodystrophy.</u>\n\n【13】In view of consortium of findings of short stature, skin and eye involvement, and neurological involvement, next generation sequencing by whole exome sequencing analysis was done. A homozygous missense variation c.682G > A in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene (chr11:g.47413633G > A) that results in the amino acid substitution of Asparagine for Aspartic acid at codon 228(p.Asp228Asn) was found. The in silico predictions of this variant were predicted to be damaging by sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT), likelihood ratio rest (LRT) and Mutation Taster 2. Based on literature review p.Asp228Asn variant of _SLC39A13_ gene has not been reported in any research publication or case study or disease databases (ClinVar/Human Gene Mutation Database/Leiden Open Variation Database). Another homozygous variant of uncertain significance was found in CEP57 gene in exon 2(c.154C > T), which is known to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 2, not correlating with our phenotype.\n\n【14】EDS spondylodysplastic type 3 (OMIM#612350) is caused by homozygous mutations in the _SLC39A13_ gene (OMIM\\*608735). After establishing the genetic basis of our diagnosis, detailed skeletal survey was done, which was suggestive of small ilia, short and wide femoral neck and platyspondyly. 2D ECHO study was normal.\n\n【15】Our patient fulfils two major criteria (short stature and muscle hypotonia), three minor criteria (skin changes, pes planus and delayed motor development) for the diagnosis of spEDS and all minor criteria for SLC39A13 gene i.e. protuberant eyes with bluish sclerae, hands with finely wrinkled palms, atrophy of the thenar muscles, and tapering fingers, hypermobility of distal joints and characteristic radiologic findings . Hereby we report a novel gene missense mutation in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene leading to EDS, spondylodysplastic type 3 (EDSSPD3). She is being regularly screened and evaluated for development milestones, vision and growth.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The EDS are a group of connective tissue disorders that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with all subtypes have hallmark features of joint hypermobility, skin hyper extensibility and fragile connective tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a case with genetically confirmed spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) associated with novel homozygous missense variation of the _SLC39A13_ gene.\n\n【18】The EDS have been classified and re-classified in the light of additions of other subtypes on discovery of mutations in genes. Lately, the International consortium devised new classification in 2017, classifying EDS into 13 subtypes accounting for the fact that mutations have been identified in collagen genes as well as genes encoding collagen modifiers via new advent in molecular diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (previously called as progeroid type), first described in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> requires fulfilment of major criteria, radiological abnormalities and general or gene-specific minor criteria for diagnosis. The spEDS subtype is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and homozygous pathogenic mutations in _B4GALT7, B3GALT6_ and _SLC39A13_ have been identified as etiological genes. Although the former two genes regulate production of glycosoaminoglycans, _SLC39A13_ regulates the intra-cytosolic influx of Zinc. Mutation in this gene thus leads to low cytosolic zinc concentrations, causing alteration of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein signalling. Though the pathogenesis of SLC39A13 mutation is not fully understood, it has been proposed that altered levels of intracellular growth factors leads to altered functioning of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissue, which is responsible for the characteristic phenotype. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To date, 13 individuals with molecularly diagnosed _SLC39A13_ \\-related spEDS have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7–9 \\]</u> and this is the first report from India to the best of our knowledge.\n\n【20】EDS group of disorders is not associated with short stature. However, unlike other subtypes of EDS, spEDS demonstrates a progressive growth retardation and compromised height potential, which is also a major criterion of diagnosis. Although _B3GALT6 and B4GALT7_ mutations are associated with skeletal abnormalities and are classified as ‘skeletal dysplasia’, _SLC39A13_ causes growth failure which is not associated with skeletal abnormalities and has proportionate body segment ratios. Growth faltering and compromised adult height has been consistently reported feature of _SLC39A13_ deficiency, though the pathogenesis of this statural phenotype is poorly understood.\n\n【21】The other major clinical criterion—hypotonia, not associated with myopathy has been consistently described associated with _SLC39A13_ in early years of life leading to delayed motor development. The subtle manifestations of this hypotonia are thenar/hypothenar atrophy, weakness of hands and waddling gait. However, recently a case describes associated myopathy features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The hypotonia can be so profound to be diagnosed as myopathy initially. Other consistent ocular connective tissue manifestations are thin sclerae, imparting a blue hue and cornea deformities (megalocornea, myopia and keratoconus), mandating ophthalmological surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Dental features like dysplastic teeth and decreased number of permanent teeth are reported, however our patient is in the phase of mixed dentition currently. Vascular fragility is not a consistent feature of spEDS unlike other subtypes, and minor venous varicosities are reported. However, a report describes catastrophic intracerebral bleeding. The peculiar phenotype includes flat facial profile, hypertelorism, downward palpebral fissures, prominent eyes and small mouth. To conclude, spEDS being a connective tissue disorder, it mandates a multidisciplinary approach involving various subspecialists. Regular surveillance of vision and growth is required.\n\n【22】The diagnostic criteria are laid down for diagnosis of spEDS with the subcategories being major, minor and gene-specific. Short stature is a feature which differentiated sp-EDS from all other varieties of EDS. SpEDS is an autosomal recessive disorder which can be diagnosed by next generation sequencing techniques. The establishment of genetic basis helps to counsel the family regarding the further course of life and progeny, undermining its importance. Our findings of association of leukodystrophy with _SLC39A13_ related spEDS expands our knowledge of the associations of this subvariety as well as spectrum of clinical presentation.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】*   What is known is the characteristic clinical and etiological profile of SLC39A3 related EDS. The features in our patient comply with previously reported patients, namely hypotonia, short stature, characteristic facies with connective tissue weakness and ocular manifestations.\n\n【25】*   What is new is discovery of association of white matter changes in form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, though non-progressive, but needs follow-up as a final outcome.\n\n【26】### ABBREVIATIONS\n\n【27】ABBREVIATIONS\n\n【28】*   DQ\n\n【29】    Development quotient;\n\n【30】    EDS\n\n【31】    Ehlers Danlos syndromes;\n\n【32】    EDSSPD3\n\n【33】    Ehlers Danlos syndrome, spondylodysplastic type 3;\n\n【34】    FLAIR\n\n【35】    Fluid attenuated inversion recovery;\n\n【36】    spEDS\n\n【37】    Spondylodysplastic EDS;\n\n【38】    SD\n\n【39】    Standard deviation;\n\n【40】    TGFβ\n\n【41】    Transforming growth factor beta.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank TNMC and BYL Nair Hospital for its constant support.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent of parents taken on appropriate form provided by the institute.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Harpreet Kaur, MD, Senior resident, Department of Paediatrics, TNMC and BYL Nair Hospital.</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Moreover, there is no standard treatment for ISR, and although many options are available, there is still limited data regarding its optimal management. We report a paradigmatic case report of a patient complaining of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, underwent multiple endovascular revascularizations for recurrent femoro-popliteal ISR. A step-by-step approach was followed. At the time of the first presentation, the ISR was treated by drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty. The repeated ISR was treated by laser debulking, achieving a good angiographic result. Finally, after the third repeated restenosis, a combined approach with laser debulking and DEB angioplasty guaranteed a good acute angiographic result. Long-term duplex-scan follow-up demonstrated the good patency of the femoro-popliteal target lesion.\n\n【2】A 53-year-old man treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and bare-metal stent in the left superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk 1 year earlier , presented with recurrent symptoms of Rutherford stage 3 claudication. He was an active heavy smoker since he was 18 years old and hypercholesterolemic on treatment with statins. No other cardiovascular risk factors or diseases were reported in the past medical history. He was scheduled to repeat the lower limb revascularization. Selective angiography revealed severe in-stent restenosis (ISR) (i.e. Tosaka class 2), which was treated with PTA and paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) (Inpact Pacific 4.0/150 and 5.0/80, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) with a satisfactory result . After 18 months, the patient suffered rapidly evolving recurrent pain at rest. Duplex scan and angiography revealed recurrent ISR, with a focal pattern (Tosaka class 1). Re-intervention was carried out with lesion debulking with excimer laser atheractomy (TurboTandem, Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO) followed by re-PTA with paclitaxel DEB (Inpact Admiral 4.0/120 and 5.0/120, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Clara, CA), with good immediate result .

Currently, there is no standard treatment for ISR, and although many options are available, there is still limited data regarding its optimal management. In this paradigmatic case, we have shown that re-intervention after SFA is common, and different approaches have been needed to achieve longer-term results. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis confidently show that PTA with DEB is superior to plain balloon angioplasty in terms of patency rate and target lesion revascularization, reducing the risk of re-intervention by 56% at 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Yet, results with different types of DEB have been inconsistent. Hence, given the heterogeneous clinical response to different DEB technologies, results from trials should be considered device-specific rather than class-specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In our case, treatment with DEB provided good immediate results, but focal ISR was evident within 18 months. A mixed technique including both atheractomy and DEB angioplasty provided better results. At difference with de-novo atherosclerosis, ISR is predominantly caused by neointimal hyperplasia, with excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells and hydrated collagen matrix. Direct removal of this tissue with atheractomy and subsequent elution of antiproliferative drug through DEB could provide more durable results. To date, only one RCT compared DEB alone with atheractomy plus DEB, showing better stent patency at 12 months, with roughly halved ISR rates in the experimental arm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These data are in line with our explanatory case, yet this was a single center, relatively small, study. In addition, results from this trial do not necessarily apply to all kinds of atheractomy devices. The optimal treatment for ISR is still unknown, and future studies testing DEB (and types thereof), atheractomy (and types thereof), covered stents or drug-eluting stents should be rigorously conducted to provide novel insights in this field.\n\n【8】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【9】No conflicts of interest must be declared.\n\n【10】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【11】This is an own work.

There have been few cases reported of these lesions being found on the genitalia. They can be found in single or in multiple form, with the latter usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD) cutaneous syndrome, also known as Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, is a genetic condition characterized by the growth of multiple benign adnexal skin tumours. The most common tumours are cylindromas, spiradenomas and trichoepitheliomas. The cause of this syndrome can be attributed to mutations in the CYLD tumour suppressor gene. If both copies of this gene are mutated, the cell undergoes uncontrolled cell proliferation and division resulting in the formation of a tumour. Here, we present an unusual case of a female patient presenting with a large cylindroma over the mons pubis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cylindromas are benign adnexal tumours found on the scalp, face and neck. They typically occur sporadically in mid-age and elderly patients. Cylindromas often present as pink or red papules or nodules and range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. Although usually painless, pain or paraesthesia can occur if nerve compression occurs due to tumour growth. They are more commonly found in females. Multiple tumours are associated with hereditary disorders, and these often manifest during childhood and early adulthood. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS), otherwise known as CYLD cutaneous syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of multiple benign skin tumours which develop from adnexal structures of the skin including spiradenomas, cylindromas and trichoepitheliomas. BSS shows variable penetrance between 60 and 100% and is caused by germline mutations on the CYLD gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The CYLD gene is a tumour suppressor gene, located on chromosome 16q12-13, which encodes an enzyme that interacts with multiple substrates of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signalling pathway and downregulates its activity by removal of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chain from TRAF2, TRAF6 and IKBKG. Activated NF-kB signalling, due to CYLD mutations, leads to increased transcription via NF-kB and subsequent uncontrolled cell proliferation and hence development of tumours associated with BSS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cutaneous neoplasms in BSS can gradually increase in size into adulthood, where they may be disfiguring. The form of BSS that is characterized only by the presence of cylindromas is known as familial cylindromatosis. This is a rare phenotypic variant of BSS.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old patient presented with a significantly symptomatic large mass arising from the mons pubis. This was identified when the patient presented for review of their utero-vaginal prolapse. The patient first noticed this mass 19 years ago, it has been gradually increasing in size but was previously asymptomatic. There was no history of bleeding or discharge from the lesion. The patient also reported a painful lump on the right upper abdominal wall present since childhood, which has not fluctuated in size.\n\n【6】On examination, the mass measured 15 × 10 cm and covered the mons pubis . The mass was firm in nature and was tethered posteriorly. There was no lymphadenopathy. An additional 2 cm hard nodule was identified in the upper abdominal wall. Examination revealed a healthy cervix, vagina and vulva but the cervix was found to descend to the level of the introitus on application of abdominal pressure. The patient has been amenorrhoeic for the past 3 years but has recently passed a small amount of blood vaginally. There was no significant medical or surgical history other than treatment for a ruptured appendix as a child. There was no relevant family history. The patient has had one vaginal delivery.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Image of growth, in front of mon pubis bone.</u>\n\n【8】Computed tomography (CT) scan identified a large mass over the mons pubis as well as a separate mass on the anterior abdominal wall . Further investigations included an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass over the mons pubis. The histology showed lobular nests of basaloid cells, surrounded by a thick basement membrane. Hyaline droplets were also seen within the tumour nests, which were composed of peripheral palisading cells with small dark nuclei, and central lager cells with pale nuclei. These features are in keeping with a benign cylindroma. The 2 cm abdominal wall mass showed similar appearance on histological examination. The patient was referred for surgical excision of the mass.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Sagittal CT showing mass lesion in front of mon pubis bone and in upper abdominal wall.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT showing mass lesion: ( **A** ) in front of mon pubis ( **B** ) on anterior abdominal wall.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】There is little available published literature on cylindromas presenting as a gynaecological condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. Cylindromas are benign skin appendageal tumours that arise from pluripotent stem cells in the folliculo-sebaceous apocrine unit with eccrine and apocrine differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Solitary lesions are usually sporadic and non-familial; these are typically slow growing and present as painless, round nodular lesions. Multiple lesions typically present on the head and neck but have been reported to occur on the trunk and extremities and rarely in the pubic area. The identification of germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in CYLD by molecular genetic testing can aid diagnosis.\n\n【13】BSS should be suspected in patients presenting with multiple benign cutaneous adnexal tumours at an early age. A family history of similar multiple tumours may suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. BSS should be suspected in individuals with any of the following: (i) the presence of one or more cylindromas or spiradenomas on the face and scalp, perinasal trichoepitheliomas or a combination of these tumour types, (ii) a cylindroma or spiradenoma on the scalp or torso that has been incidentally found on imaging or (iii) a membranous basal cell adenoma-type salivary gland tumour in an individual with a single cylindroma, spiradenoma or trichoepithelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Histologic evaluation is needed for diagnosis. Cylindromas are described as nonencapsulated dermal nodules of epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Islands of cancer cells are typically reported as having a ‘jigsaw puzzle’ patterned appearance outlined by eosinophilic, membrane-like hyaline basement material that is PAS positive. These islands are mainly within the dermis but may extend into the subcutis.\n\n【14】To diagnose BSS, a mixture of the following is needed, early age onset of skin neoplasms and progression of disease over time, family history of similar neoplasms, histopathologic findings on tissue biopsy, association with tumours in the parotid or salivary glands. Genetic testing should be considered in those who have two or more biopsy confirmed cylindromas, spiradenomas or trichoepitheliomas. Germline mutation in CYLD confirms the diagnosis. If no germline variant is seen and there is no known family history, mosaicism should be considered.\n\n【15】Although the majority of cases are benign, malignant transformation can occur in 5–10%. Rapid growth, bleeding and ulceration are suggestive of malignant transformation.

She had been complaining of intermittent palpitations and limited exercise tolerance. Clinical examination revealed a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and a split second heart sound. Electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary stenosis with a peak velocity of 3 m/s, peak gradient of 37 mmHg and mean gradient of 22 mmHg; however, the PV was not well visualized.\n\n【3】CMR revealed the unusual appearance of a quadricuspid pulmonary valve (QPV) with four cusps of almost equal size . The leaflets were mobile with moderate-severely restricted central opening (valve area 0.9–1 cm <sup>2 </sup> ; Supplementary Video 1 ) and moderate flow acceleration . There was also mild pulmonary regurgitation. The PV annulus was non-dilated. The main and left pulmonary arteries were moderately dilated (32 and 28 mm, respectively), with high-normal right pulmonary artery dimensions (21 mm). Biventricular volumes and function were normal.

To date only two cases are reported in the literature in children aged <18 years. Here we are reporting a case of a 4-year-old boy who has Chylothorax and chylous ascites due to peritoneal tuberculosis which is complicated by medullary nephrocalcinosis and improved after antitubercular therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The concurrent occurrence of both chylothorax and chylous ascites (CA) associated with tuberculosis (TB) is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Morton first described CA in a 2-year-old boy with disseminated TB in 1694 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The etiology of chylothorax and CA can be classified into three broad categories, non-traumatic (congenital, infectious, neoplastic, cirrhotic or cardiogenic), traumatic (postoperative, blunt trauma to the chest or thoracic spine, penetrating injuries of the chest) and idiopathic. Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system and trauma are common causes in children. Infectious disease including TB account for the majority of cases in developing countries like our country 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】A CASE REPORT\n-------------\n\n【5】A 4-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with the complaint of progressive abdominal distention and growth retardation which began at the age of one. He referred to several doctors without being able to give the right diagnosis. There was no history of fever, cough, or contact with TB patients. He had received his regular vaccines. On physical examination, his body weight was 19 kg (+2.3DS), height was 93 cm (−2.1DS), body temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, abdominal girth was 74 cm, non pitting lower extremities edema, pulse rate of 90/min, respiratory rate of 25braethe/minute and there was decrease in breathe sounds and dullness to percussion in the left lower lung field. Oxygen saturation was normal. There was bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) on his left shoulder. Abdomen was extremely distended. Shifting dullness and fluid wave were present. We could not evaluate organomegaly because of ascites. His other systems were normal.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigation reports were as follows: hemoglobin (HB) 11.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 16 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> (neutrophils 76%), platelets 712 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , C-reactive protein (CRP) was normal, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 30 mm at the end of first hour, amylase 36 U/L (normal 40-140), cholesterol 119 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL, total protein 4.4 g/dL, albumin 2 g/dL, IgE 7.3 IU/mL (normal). Other liver function tests, kidney function tests and electrolytes were normal.\n\n【7】Urinalysis showed calcium oxalate (++). Culture and sensitivity were normal. Peripheral blood smear was normal. Chest and plain abdominal films showed left pleural effusion, diffuse abdominal haziness, elevation of the diaphragm, bulging of the flanks and fluid accumulation . Tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed massive amount of fluid in the abdomen, left pleural effusion (750 mL), deposits within kidney caliculi, portal vein, supraliver veins and liver artery were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Chest and plain abdominal films showing left pleural effusion, diffuse abdominal haziness, elevation of the diaphragm, bulging of the flanks and fluid accumulation.</u>\n\n【9】During investigations for the ascites etiology, the echocardiography was normal and the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no specific signs except follicular duodenitis and the biopsies result were chronic duodenitis without villous atrophy (Marsh score 0). Analysis of the ascitic fluid revealed milky white in color, with white cell of 160 mm <sup>3 </sup> (lymphocytes dominate), total protein 0.7 g/dL, albumin 0.2 g/dL, LDH 114 U/L, cholesterol 48 mg/dL, triglyceride 828 mg/dL (high), amylase 10 U/L, glucose 128 mg/dL. Serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.8 indicating a transudative ascites. Culture of fluid was sterile and cytological examination was negative for malignant cells. Stain for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Pleurocentesis revealed grossly milky fluid with high level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) 47.5 U/L (normal 0–40), highly suggestive of a peritoneal TB.\n\n【10】Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed evidence of moderate left pleural effusion, massive fluid accumulation in peritoneal cavities and medullary nephrocalcinosis signs .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|CT chest, abdomen and pelvis showing accumulation of fluid in the pelvis and the whole abdominal cavity, medullary nephrocalcinosis in the right kidney.</u>\n\n【12】Work up for cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis including the serum calcium 7.3 mg/dL (low), serum phosphorus 3.7 mg/dL, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 4.9 ng/mL (low), parathyroid hormone (PTH) was normal, arterial blood gas test was normal and a 24-h urine accumulation was as follows: total size 750 mL, protein 85 mg, creatinine 22 mg, calcium 300 mg. A 24-h urinary excretion of calcium was 15.7 mg/kg (more than 4 mg/kg) indicating a hypercalciuria.\n\n【13】For control of ascites, the patient was initiated on medium chain triglyceride (MCT-based diet). Antitubercular therapy was started with regimen containing isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. Abdominal distention and ascites fluid resolved gradually with time. Abdominal ultrasound after 2 weeks revealed resolution of ascites. He had started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypercalciuria. He responded well to the treatment and hypercalciuria was resolved. His physical examination and general condition were stable after he finished antituberculosis therapy. Laboratory evaluation was normal and has been uptill now.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Peritoneal TB (TBP) accounts for ~0.1–0.7% of all cases of TB and 通用删除7(英):<u>(25–60)</u>% of abdominal TB cases. It is seen most commonly in patients between 25 and 55 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In children it is seen with a lower frequency. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB in children represented 11% of total TB cases and the prevalence was 0.38 (0.35–0.41) per 100 000 in pediatric group in Syria, a developing country, 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The literature regarding mycobacterial infection related chylothorax and CA has been published primarily in the form of case reports. Only two cases are reported in children. Kim _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> incubated tuberculosis bacilli in sputum and pleural fluid of a 17-year-old female patient with diffuse nodular opacities in her pulmonary parenchyma multiple necrotic abdominal lymphadenopathies, chylothorax and CA. Rabie _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> also reported a 3-year-old boy who had paradoxical tuberculosis associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome complicated by chyloperitoneum and secondary chylothorax.\n\n【17】The clinical presentation of CA is characterized by progressive and painless abdominal distension, weight gain, sign of malnutrition along with symptoms, and signs of underlying conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In children with tuberculosis, chylothorax is the result of lymph node compression or erosion of the thoracic duct, often identified on computerized tomography of the chest. The development of chylothorax in the absence enlarged chest lymph nodes or constrictive pericarditis in our case suggest that the chylothorax was secondary to the transdiaphragmatic movement of CA. This shunting across the diaphragm is a well described as a cause for chylothorax, possibly due to defects in the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Small chylothorax can be asymptomatic and is detected incidentally. A patient with large chylothorax usually presents with signs and symptoms caused by the mechanical effect of compression on lung expansion (breathlessness, dyspnea, chest pressure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Paracentesis is the most important test in diagnosing chylothorax and CA. Chyle presents as a milky, cloudy and turbid liquid, this should be distinguished from pseudochylous ascites, in which the turbid appearance is due to cellular degeneration from infection or malignancy without actually containing high levels of triglycerides. Diagnostic triglyceride values are typically above 200 mg/dL, although some authors use a cutoff value of 110 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Analysis of ascetic fluid often shows exudative features with lymphocytic predominance and SAAG lesser than 1.1 g/dL but a falsely high value of SAAG may occur in CA as lipid fractions tend to interfere with laboratory determination of albumin as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】ADA values in peritoneal and pleural fluid can be used as a support marker for tuberculous effusion. Some studies have reported a high sensitivity, up to 100%, and a specificity of 97% using cutoff values of 36–40 IU/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Acid-fast smear of ascitic fluid has a low yield with a reported sensitivity of 0–6%, while the frequency of a positive culture for _M. tuberculosis_ was 2–50%. A positive TST has been reported in 24–100% of the cases; this test is diagnostically insignificant, as negative skin test may be seen in many patients with histologically confirmed TBP. Peritoneal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In our patient AFB, TST and culture of peritoneal fluid were negative. PCR was not available in the hospital and his parents refused to perform peritoneal biopsy. There was no pulmonary involvement according to chest radiographies. The patient’s parents denied any history of trauma. Constrictive pericarditis, as a possible cause of chylothorax and CA, was not noted on the result of echocardiography. Typical appearance of CA, chylothorax and medullary nephrocalcinosis established diagnosis of TBP. High ADA concentration in the pleural fluid provides supportive information for a clinical diagnosis. Nephrocalcinosis is a disorder in which there is too much calcium deposited in the kidneys. Any disorder that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine may lead to nephrocalcinosis. The condition that causes medullary nephrocalcinosis in our case includes tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The patient had started on tuberculosis therapy and MCT-based diet for chylothorax and CA. He was initiated on hydrochlorothiazide for hypercalciuria.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained patient’s parents informed consent for the presentation of this case.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Lava Mohammad, Department of pediatrics, Tishreen university hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

RR-TB is TB caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ strains that are resistant to rifampicin, whereas MDR TB is defined as TB with _in vitro_ resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin and XDR-TB are strains that fulfill the definition of MDR/RR TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinoles (Moxifloxacillin/Levofloxacillin) and at least one additional group A drugs i.e. Bedaquiline or Linezolid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Previously, management of DR-TB has been a problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> but now with the coming of new and repurposed drugs, there is an improvement in the DR TB treatment outcomes and linezolid is among the best drug when added to Multi drug regimen and Extensive drug regimen with Bedaquiline and Pretomanid (BPaL). Linezolid is an antibiotic in the group of Oxazolidinones that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The toxicity profile of linezolid—which includes partially reversible myelosuppression, optic neuritis, neuropathy and lactic acidosis—limits its use. Studies have shown that treatment limiting toxicity can occur in as many as 11% of persons who receive treatment with linezolid. Adverse events mostly occur when linezolid is given at doses of >600 mg a day, but they can usually be identified early with routine monitoring and are often reversible upon discontinuation of the drug or lowering of the dose. Pyridoxine could be used when linezolid is administered to minimize side effects. Knowledge about the safety of linezolid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited so caution is advised and it is not clearly on the duration for side effects to appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【4】An 81-year-old HIV-negative Malawian man was diagnosed with Rifampicin resistance (RR) TB through Xpert MTB/Rif and was confirmed Multi Drug resistance (MDR) tuberculosis with culture and drug susceptibility testing which was done at National Reference Laboratory. He had no TB history even in his family, but there was history of working in mines in South Africa around 1970s. Contact investigation was done to his four household and close contacts and all were screened negative. Baseline investigations revealed hemoglobin of 12.4, platelets of 147, ALT of 6.8 and AST of 16.68 and chest X-ray with cavities on both lungs . He had no comorbid condition and was not taking any other medicines. With the baseline assessment results, he was put on Longer Regimen All Oral comprised of Bedaquiline 400 mg for 2 weeks then 200 mg for 22 weeks making a total of 6 months, Linezolid 600 mg once a day, Clofazimine 100 mg once a day, Cycloserine 750 mg once a day, Levofloxacillin 1000 mg once a day and Pyridoxine 150 mg once a day. He was receiving this medication as an outpatient but under DOT by a trained nurse and a volunteer and was scheduled to be attending monthly clinical monitoring and follow-up review.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A chest X-ray which was taken before starting treatment with cavities more prominent to the left than right lung.</u>\n\n【6】At Week 8 while at home, he started vomiting fresh blood and was taken for admission at Karonga district hospital for intensive care and Rockall score was used to determine the severity of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) bleeding although endoscopy was not done due to machine failure (Rockall score of 5). Upon assessment, there was no pertinent risk factor of upper GIT bleeding i.e. no history of smoking, alcohol intake, use of NSAIDs, anticoagulation, and there was no chronic liver disease and peptic ulcer disease. On examination, he had a low BP (85/50 mmHg), PR 118 b/min, RR 20 b/min, temperature of 36°C and the rest of the physical examination was normal. Whole blood count was done, hemoglobin of 4.7 from 12.4 and platelet count was 79 from 147 at baseline, respectively. He was transfused with four units of whole blood in total and linezolid was stopped immediately. All other medicines remained the same with no dose modification and the bleeding stopped spontaneously after 2 days while on treatment. He was diagnosed with an adverse event that was graded to 4 with as life-threatening. An adverse drug reaction report was filled and sent for pharmacovigilance at Malawi Pharmacy and Medicine Regulatory Authority. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of vomiting blood like esophageal varices, esophageal tear, perforated peptic ulcer disease or esophagitis. There was nothing abnormal detected on ultra sound scan on the abdomen. He stayed in the ward for a week and then later was discharged with hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl and platelet count of 145. He was to continue with monthly follow-up , and iron tablets were supplied for a month. The patient culture converted to negative at Month 2 and he remained culture negative up until 18 months when he was finishing treatment. Linezolid was not re-introduced and there was no further episode of vomiting blood and patient was declared cured.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|A table of baseline and monthly follow-up results.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Linezolid is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic; however, severe adverse effects including myelosuppression, optic neuritis, peripheral neuritis, lactic acidosis are common. Of note, it is the only medicine in Group A that has myelosuppression as one of the adverse event, whereas others in the same group like Bedaquiline, levofloxacin and Clofazimine mainly causesQT prolongation, headache, skin hyperpigmentation and hepatotoxicity. Some studies have reported that the rate of adverse events due to linezolid was high and the most adverse event reported frequently were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea), peripheral neuritis and optic neuritis and that the rate of myelosuppression including anemia and neutropenia was 32.9% higher and the presence of myelosuppression in the group with an initial dose of linezolid >600 mg per day was higher than that in the groups with an initial dose of linezolid less than or equal to 600 mg per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Linezolid toxicity is due to structural homology between target 23 s rRNA in _M. tuberculosis_ and 16 s rRNA in human mitochondria resulting in a narrow therapeutic index and uncertainty around dose optimization. It is reported in one of the study that 38 XDR TB who treated with linezolid demonstrated the inverse association between linezolid trough concentrations associated with lower mitochondrial function and commented that long-term use of linezolid is associated with development of the mitochondrial toxicities of peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, which is contrary with this case report as it happened within 8 weeks of starting the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Other studies have reported that linezolid is effective and safe for the elderly with Gram-positive bacterial infection, but platelet count should be well monitored and that HIV may be a risk factor of linezolid-associated adverse events which in this case is HIV negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is also reported that there is limitation on evaluation of the efficacy and safety of linezolid as efficacy in clinical practice is likely higher due to the additive or synergistic effect when used as combination with other drugs and that linezolid profile is not yet completely known and therefore need quality clinical research to better understand the appropriate dosage that clinicians can prescribe to minimize the probability of events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】Much as linezolid is given and presumed safe in patients on second-line anti-TB, knowledge about the safety of linezolid associated with hematemesis is limited. Published adverse event reports lack adequate information regarding hematemesis after initiation of linezolid. In our case, the relationship between linezolid and the onset of hematemesis is plausible. Health workers should be alert to the possibility of such adverse reaction.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Malawi National TB/leprosy elimination program will support.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Following guideline of suspected ischemic heart disease diagnostic algorithm, it was recommended to perform pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) which reveled no perfusion defects suggestive of ischemia were detected . Early invasive strategy was not recommended in such patient according to guidelines. So, guideline-directed medical therapy was initiated. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed that reveled outpouching of anterior septal wall with no myocardial edema, no inflammatory changes, no intramural tumors and no myocardial fatty infiltration; delayed gadolinium enhancement showed no macroscopic scars or thrombus . Two years ago, she had emotional marital stress then she complained about severe crushing chest pain and was admitted into another hospital. Her ECG did not show any significant ischemic changes despite already present LBBB. Her cardiac enzymes were normal. She performed stress-ECG for 6 min that was terminated by severe dyspnea but no chest pain with ST-segment depression in inferior leads. Coronary angiography was done and demonstrated normal coronary arteries  but was complicated by right femoral hematoma. Predischarge TTE showed near-normal LV systolic function (EF 51%), diastolic dysfunction grade-I, and paradoxical septal motion with apical hypokinesia and ballooning (diagnosed as Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy). Patient was discharged on Ramipril 5 mg, Bisoprolol 10 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg and Aspirin 81 mg.

Patient was improved with no dyspnea or chest pain at follow-up visits.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has a clinical presentation similar to an acute coronary syndrome. Actually, most patients experienced with chest pain or dyspnea. Usually, the ECG at presentation shows ST-segment elevation but T wave inversion and pathological Q waves are present in majority of patients. Therefore, initial diagnosis and treatment of patients in the emergency room remains challenging. Unfortunately, there are no clinical, radiological or laboratory characteristics that certainly diagnose this syndrome. However, postmenopausal women with a history of recent emotional or physical stress, and with the typical profound wall-motion abnormalities; despite normal coronary arteries on angiography should raise suspicion for it. Furthermore, proposed Mayo’s diagnostic criteria for the syndrome had evolved and should be used.\n\n【13】Multimodality imaging plays a pivotal role in managing the case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Several variants have been described based on the regions of LV wall-motion abnormality. Typically, Takotsubo is characterized by ballooning apical akinesis/hypokinesis associated with basal hyperkinesis. Although, reversed variant of Takotsubo is rare and characterized by the basal akinesis/hypokinesis associated with apical hyperkinesis. However, other patterns of LV wall-motion abnormality have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Cardiac MRI is appropriate to evaluate LV function and wall-motion abnormalities, and to confirm the absence of delayed gadolinium enhancement. This helps differentiation of Takotsubo from other differential diagnosis as myocardial infarction and myocarditis, both pathologies associated with delayed gadolinium enhancement. There is limited consensus in long-term management, although it is reasonable to treat patients with β-blockers and ACE inhibitors during the ventricular recovery period. However, no data support their continuous use for the prevention of recurrence or improvement of survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Fortunately, the prognosis is favorable for patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy who survived the initial episode using symptomatic and supportive measures. LV systolic function usually returns to normal range within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, recent studies have found that Takotsubo patients had a similar long-term outcome compared with age- and sex-matched acute coronary syndrome patients. Additionally, these outcomes also vary according to the preceding trigger, and patients with events triggered by emotional stress had a favorable short- and long-term prognosis. Thus, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a much more complex syndrome than previously thought, and should be classified according to the underlying trigger event to accurately risk stratify and predict short- and long-term outcomes for each patient individually. Furthermore, the new classification (InterTAK Classification) could be useful in predicting Takotsubo outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are published rare cases with serious complication of LV dysfunction after Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These serious complications ranged from cardiogenic shock, persistent LV aneurysm that even required resection and LV plasty, ventricular septal perforation with septal dissection, and cardiac rupture that may lead to death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, careful observation with appropriate treatment of complication is needed for prevention of catastrophic serious outcomes.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Special thanks to Dr Ahmed Loutfy, BSN MSN PhD for his contributes and valuable comments to this case report.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The case study was approved by local hospital ethical committee and with Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Full verbal and written informed consent had been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Ali Elzieny is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

According to the increasing use of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, adverse effects can occur in several organs since its ligand PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. The estimated rate of neurological complications is 1–4.2% of patients, and neuromuscular disorders are the most common. Adverse effects on the central nervous system including encephalitis are less frequent.

Anti-PD-1 antibodies bind with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and these antibodies maintain self-tolerance during chronic antigen stimulation by normally suppressing T-cell activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In the tumor microenvironment, tumors inhibit antitumor T-cell-mediated reactions by expressing the PD-L1 ligand, and the blockade of anti-PD-1 antibodies can initiate an antitumor immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although the balanced promotion and inhibition of T-cell activation is maintained to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases, anti-PD-1 antibodies can cause autoimmune adverse effects by producing unbalanced T-cell responses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. With the increasing use of ICPIs, adverse effects can occur in several organs where PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed.

Adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS), including encephalitis, are less frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. Most encephalitis associated with ICPIs show focal encephalitis. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern of nonfocal encephalitis is meningeal enhancement or multiple brain parenchyma hyperintensities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Here, a patient receiving anti-PD-1 antibodies exhibited cranial dura matter involvement, and dura enhancement on MRI was resolved by treatment withdrawal with anti-PD-1 antibodies only.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】This is a case of a 69-year-old man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with seven courses of pembrolizumab (200 mg) combined with pemetrexed (820 mg/kg) and carboplatin (6.6 mg/kg) administered every month. An enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed every year for the early detection of metastatic brain tumors. After seven courses of these chemotherapies and pembrolizumab, the brain MRI revealed thickness and enhancement of the dura matter  without the abnormal intensity of the brain parenchyma. An asymptomatic internal carotid posterior communicating (IC-PC) artery aneurysm was evident, leading to a visit to our department. No history of neurological manifestations, including headache, and no neurological deficit were reported. He had no meningismus. Serum laboratory examinations were within the normal range. Serum autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-DNA antibody, and anti-cardiolipin antibody, were negative. Additionally, the levels of serum IgG, IgM or IgG-4 were not increased. The levels of serum aspergillus antigen, β-D glucan and angiotensin-converting enzyme were within the normal range. Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings revealed no white blood cells, protein (37 mg/dl) and glucose (64 mg/dl) with no increase in titers of herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus, cryptococcus antigen or adenosine deaminase. The IgG index was 0.45. The bacterial and tuberculosis culture and cytology results of the CSF were negative. Four months after discontinuing pembrolizumab, a repeat MRI revealed that the enhancement of dura matter was resolved . Five months after the first MRI, IC-PC aneurysm was operated on and simultaneously a dural biopsy was performed. Histological findings revealed no malignant or inflammatory cells. The clinical course was free of neurological complaints or features. Additional cancer treatment was not performed because tumor shrinkage was maintained with no further development on a repeat follow-up whole-body computed tomography. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for these routine clinical examinations, treatments and publication of the case report.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Upper panel: Brain enhanced MRI showed enhancements of the dura matter after seven cycles of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

Previously, one patient with meningoencephalitis revealed diffuse dural enhancement on MRI, and the patient recovered completely after steroid treatment; however, the detailed clinical information, including imaging, was not mentioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The exact mechanism underpinning neurological adverse events has been largely unknown. It has been postulated that ICPI disrupts immune tolerance resulting in an exaggerated immune response manifesting neurological adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Cross-reactivity between the nervous system antigens and antigens expressing the tumor is a hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. PD-L2 is expressed in brain endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, but whether the ligand exists in the dura matter is uncertain. A mouse model expressing a neo-self-antigen in both Purkinje neurons and implanted breast tumor cells evoked antigen-specific T-cell migration into the cerebellum after treatment with an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Most patients presenting with neurological adverse effects had no involvement of other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, supporting the cross-reactivity of specific nervous system antigens with tumor antigens.\n\n【9】This case was asymptomatic, and complications due to ICPIs resolved with ICPI discontinuation were incidentally found. The patient did not need additional immunosuppressant treatment. The diagnosis of encephalitis associated with ICPIs can be challenging because MRI is not highly sensitive, with an estimated sensitivity of 55% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These patients have advanced malignancies with limited treatment options. It is important to note that treatment discontinuation risks and benefits need to be carefully discussed, and decisions for treatment need to be made on a case-to-case basis, depending on the severity of neurological symptoms.\n\n【10】ICPI discontinuation only has a potential during recovery from a mild CNS disorder. Hence, as a recommendation, additional immunosuppressant treatment with efficiency for reducing the severity of neurological complications due to ICPIs should be considered when severe clinical deficits are evident or worsen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thanks to Dr Shigeto Kizu, Department of Respiratory Medicine for his management of lung adenocarcinoma.

This is the third case reported of this disease in the world with a novel variant. A boy was referred due to the absence of neck holding and hand tremors. The examinations found facial anomalies. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral atrophy and diffused white matter, and irregularities were seen in his electroencephalogram (EEG). The echocardiography revealed a mid-muscular ventricular septal defect. A whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis revealed a novel variant (c.979C > T; p.Pro327Ser) of uncertain significance in the HS6ST2 gene indicating Paganini-Miozzo syndrome. The current case provides additional evidence that MRXSPM can be associated with various neurological and cardiac complications. It is essential to rule out other causes, such as metabolic and infectious diseases. EEG, MRI and WES analyses can help to make a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Paganini-Miozzo syndrome (MRXSPM) is marked by a global developmental deficit, delayed intellectual development, high myopia and minor facial dysmorphism. Paganini-Miozzo syndrome is transmitted by X-linked recessive inheritance. It is caused by a hemizygous mutation on chromosome Xq26 in the heparan sulfate 6-O-sulftransferase2 (HS6ST2) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In 2019, Paganini-Miozzo syndrome was detected for the first time in two monozygotic Italian twin boys. Speech and walking were impaired in the two brothers. They had facial, ear, eye and mouth abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present the case of a 21-month-old child with MRXSPM-consistent whole exome sequencing (WES). This child is the third case of Paganini-Miozzo syndrome found worldwide with a novel variant.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】The child was a 21-month-old boy, first in birth order, born via cesarian section delivery at 38 weeks. The parents were genetically unrelated. His mother did not mention any problem in her pregnancy. The combined test in the 12th week of pregnancy was normal. His birth weight, height and head circumference were 3600 g, 51.5 cm and 35.5 cm, respectively. These variables were currently normal. In the patient’s first-degree family, there was no history of the disease. The patient’s grandmother had six abortions. Also, his cousin had a history of seizures.\n\n【8】The child’s parents were referred to our clinic at 2 months due to the lack of neck holding and hand tremors. The pediatric neurologist suspected seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) were ordered for the infant. The brain MRI revealed that generalized cerebral atrophy and diffuse white matter in the periventricular, subarachnoid and juxtacortical regions, together with the involvement of the brain stem (posterior to the pons and midbrain), putamen, cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Some of these lesions were diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-positive, indicating that a portion of them was acute. Dilated Virchow-Robin spaces were also detected . Differential diagnoses for the patient included diseases with leukodystrophies such as Krabbe, Mucopolysaccharidoses and other mitochondrial causes. EEG results revealed burst suppression. High-amplitude, irregular and discordant electrical activity, including slow, sharp waves and multi-focal spikes, was also detected, indicating hypsarrhythmia . Therefore, the patient’s differential diagnosis also included West syndrome. He received Liskantin 250 mg and Levebel 100 mg syrup. After auscultation of extra heart sounds, echocardiography revealed a mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD). The patient had elevated plasma ammonia (113.18 μmol/L) and alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (53 and 48 U/L, respectively). Metabolic tests were normal. Due to the elevated levels of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the tests (11.25 g/L, normal < 9), a pediatric infectious diseases specialist performed a lumbar puncture with the suspicion of central nervous system infection by CMV, which revealed a normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis and the absence of an infection. In addition, both the eye exam for chorioretinitis and the auditory brainstem response test were normal. Finally, a WES analysis was performed for the patient that revealed a novel variant (c.979C > T; p.Pro327Ser) of uncertain significance in heparan sulfate 6-O-sulftransferase2 (HS6ST2) gene. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with Paganini-Miozzo syndrome. Despite the aforementioned medications, convulsions continued and progressed to numerous times a day. Clobazam 10 mg half-tablet every 8 hours was added. In addition, subcutaneous or intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ampoule 1 U/kg (via 100 unit insulin syringe) was prescribed daily for 14 days, then every other day for the next 14 days and once every 3 days for the third 14 days to taper off. Currently, the child’s seizures are well controlled.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Brain MRI: diffuse white matter in the periventricular, subarachnoid and juxtacortical areas, as well as brain stem, putamen, cerebellum and bilateral thalami involvement.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|EEG: burst suppression and hypsarrhythmia.</u>\n\n【11】In the examination, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge and arched eyebrows were observed . Currently, the child can hold his neck, but he cannot sit or walk and can only crawl with outstretched hands. He can make sounds, but cannot articulate simple words.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Patient’s appearance: hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge and arched eyebrows.</u>\n\n【13】The child undergoes echocardiography every 6 months, electrocardiography every 3 months, as well as a pediatric neurologist visit every 3 months.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】MRXSPM was first discovered in Italy, by Paganini _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> in two monozygotic twin brothers. The present report is the second case report of MRXSPM.\n\n【16】The two Italian cases were referred for intellectual disability. Our patient similarly had delayed developmental milestones such as neck holding, intellectual and walking impairment. Our patient’s seizures manifested themselves as hand tremors. At 1 year old, the Italian boys had febrile convulsions that resolved. Our patient had frequent seizures even after 1 year of age, which were controlled by medication. Italian twins had facial, gastrointestinal and genitourinary issues. Except for facial anomalies, our patient’s physical exams were normal.\n\n【17】The two brothers were delivered at 30 weeks due to fetal distress and were born from a triplet dichorionic-tri amniotic pregnancy resulting from _in vitro_ fertilization. In contrast, our case involves a singleton born of a natural, full-term pregnancy.\n\n【18】The Italian twins’ epileptiform EEG showed diffuse and irregular spikes. Our patient’s EEG showed hypsarrhythmia and burst suppression. Italian brothers’ brain MRIs showed mild lateral ventriculomegaly. Our MRI showed modest lateral ventricular enlargement, white matter diffusion and extensive atrophy. The Italian brothers’ lab tests showed high serum lactate, elevated alanine and low glycemic scores. In our patient’s laboratory tests, these values were normal. In addition, plasma ammonia levels were increased in our patient. The WES analysis of Italian twins detected the mutation c.916G > C in the X-linked HS6ST2 gene. However, our patient had a novel variant (c.979C > T).\n\n【19】Given the small number of Paganini-Miozzo syndrome cases worldwide, it is currently not possible to form a definitive assessment of the condition’s defining features.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【21】In MRXSPM, there is evidence of developmental milestone delays and minor anomalies. In addition, these patients may experience seizures, which manifest as irregular spikes on EEG. The MRI of these patients reveals brain atrophy, ventricular enlargement or diffuse white matter.\n\n【22】In general, children referred with neurodevelopmental issues and seizures, as well as similar MRI or EEG abnormalities, should be examined initially for metabolic and infectious diseases. If the aforementioned diagnoses were ruled out, WES should be performed to examine genetic disorders and epileptic syndromes. The mutation in the X-chromosome HS6st2 gene indicates MRXSPM.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>R.S. was the principal investigator of the study.

As part of our first assignments with Médecins Sans Frontières, we, as pediatricians, participated in fieldwork for a 6-month period each in 2018. The project was based in a conflict setting in northeastern Syria. During this time, we were responsible for overseeing the medical treatment for pediatric patients in both a hospital and community settings. Part of our duties was to provide medical care for a cohort of patients living with thalassemia, an autosomal recessive, transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathy. There is a baseline high carrier rate of thalassemia among the Syrian population. In this thalassemia clinic, we cared for over 200 patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. Their essential treatments of safe blood transfusion and appropriate iron chelation therapy had been interrupted due to the conflict. Many patients suffered from complications of iron overload; including cardiac toxicity, delayed growth and puberty and hepatic dysfunction. Although there was inadequate laboratory diagnostics available, some of our patients also displayed symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus secondary to their complex medical conditions. Furthermore, we observed a high rate of hepatitis C infection and some cases of hepatitis B within our patient cohort, thought to be due to unsafe blood transfusion during the height of the conflict. Although progress was made during our time spent working in the department and significant developments made with patient care guidelines, we feel that there is still room to improve practice to further optimize patient care for this vulnerable cohort in this resource-limited setting. Challenges included limitations in accessing care due to a lack of safe and reliable transportation to thalassemia clinic, as well as complexities in the sociocultural perceptions on HIV testing, the significant psychological morbidity as a result of living in an area of protracted conflict and the provision of care for a complex chronic illness in this resource-limited setting. Documentation of the situation and challenges is necessary to learn and improve practice and to ultimately result in improved patient care and clinical outcomes. We hope that the _Oxford Medical Case Reports_ will contribute to increasing the available knowledge base through the submission of papers by medical staff in humanitarian settings sharing their experiences and challenges with the provision care for people living with complex medical conditions in similar resource-limited settings.\n\n【1】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【2】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She had been aware of left thigh pain for the last 9 months, then she was referred to our division. X-ray showed osteolytic lesion in the left femur . Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) suspected multiple bone metastasis including frontal bone, mandible, left scapula, rib, vertebra, pubis, left femur and sternum . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhanced mass in the sternum, which may be pricked with a needle biopsy easily . A needle biopsy of the sternum was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was consistent with metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade III. Tumor cells in the surgical specimen of the lung showed typical whorl formation and positive of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and vimentin in immunohistochemical staining . Tumor cells of the biopsy specimen showed malignant progression with high Ki-67 index; EMA and vimentin were also positive in immunohistochemical staining .

As far as we investigated only <45 cases have been reported so far since its first report by Kemnitz and Heinrich 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Among these cases, only five cases were malignant or atypical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. A primary pulmonary meningioma is largely benign, grows slowly and has an excellent prognosis. Incarbone _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reviewed 37 cases of primary pulmonary meningiomas reported in the literature. Among 25 histologically confirmed primary pulmonary meningioma patients with radiological data of the CNS and histological assessment, 23 (92%) cases had benign and 2 (8%) cases had a malignant primary pulmonary meningioma.\n\n【13】Dalle Ore _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reviewed 1193 patients treated for meningioma including intracranial meningiomas. Ten patients had extracranial lesions suspicious for metastasis. At biopsy, eight were meningioma metastasis, one patient was a non-meningioma malignancy and the other patient was lost to follow-up prior to biopsy. Biopsy-confirmed metastasis occurred in the liver 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, lung 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, mediastinum 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> and bone 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. The observed incidence of metastasis was 0.67% ( _n_ \\= 8). Incidence increased to 2% of WHO grade II and 8.6% of grade III meningiomas. Among these patients, no case of extracranial meningioma with bone metastasis has been reported.\n\n【14】We have reported rare case of malignant extracranial meningioma with multiple bone metastasis. By needle biopsy, we confirmed histopathological diagnosis as metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, WHO grade III. Moreover, pathology of the surgical specimen showed some vascular invasions in Fig. 4 , suggesting malignant behavior. In conclusion, our experience with the present case in primary pulmonary meningioma has shown that we should think about extracranial meningioma as differential diagnosis in case of the patient with bone metastasis. The patients with extracranial meningioma should therefore be carefully monitored.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest statement\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u></u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u></u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u></u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication and gave their consent.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a giant localized hepatohilar mass . Histology of percutaneous transhepatic biopsy specimens led to a diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). Thus, chemotherapy with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (pemetrexed: 500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on Day 1; cisplatin: 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on Day 1) was intravenously administered every 21 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After a total of six identical courses, the maximum tumour diameter did not change as revealed by contrast-enhanced CT and thus the treatment response was categorized as SD (stable disease) according to the RECIST guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Given that protracted myelosuppression rendered the planned chemotherapy more difficult to administer, surgical resection was performed 5 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy (RECIST; SD). The encapsulated tumour originated from the right upper retroperitoneum, compressing the surrounding organs but not directly invading them, and a simple tumourectomy was subsequently completed. The intra-operative lavage cytology showed a negative result. Consequently, the completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which is generally used to assess the extent of residual disease at the end of a surgical resection for peritoneal surface malignancies, was CC-0 (no visible residual disease). Histology of the resected specimen established a definitive diagnosis of epithelioid MPM, in which histological chemotherapeutic effect was rarely seen. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed this diagnosis (positive for calretinin, D2–40 and CK5/6; negative for BerEP4 and MOC31). The post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 7 days after surgery. Further use of cisplatin plus pemetrexed was certainly considered one of the possible recommended treatment, but the patient already had undergone long-term drug tolerance and was no longer hoping for further treatment. No sign of recurrence was observed 60 months after surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Contrast-enhanced CT axial view shows a giant localized hepatohilar mass, presenting poor and inhomogeneous enhancement, ~150 mm in size.

There was no history of trauma, allergy, contact lens use or potential exposure to infection. There was no past medical or ocular history of note.\n\n【8】On examination, pinhole visual acuity was 0.6LogMAR and 0.1LogMAR in the right and left eye, respectively. Assessment of the right eye showed an inferior rupture of Descemet’s membrane and a perforation at the 7 o’clock position. There was associated iridocorneal touch, shallow anterior chamber and iris stranding to the site of rupture. On administration of 2% fluorescein there was a positive Seidel’s test that highlighted low flow leakage of aqueous . Examination of the contralateral eye revealed evidence of inferior corneal thinning.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Inferiotemporal peripheral cornea with a bandage contact lens _in situ_ ( **A** ) and associated localized edema ( **B** ).

Blood was obtained to screen for potential systemic disorders associated with corneal perforation (full blood count, urea and electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, full vasculitic and syphilis screen). In the absence of systemic features, normal blood tests and contralateral thinning an underlying systemic disease was felt to be unlikely.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Pentacam <sup>® </sup> (Oculus) corneal topography of the contralateral eye demonstrating evidence of peripheral steepening and corneal thinning consistent with a diagnosis of PMD.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Seven-week follow-up SS-ASOCT images showing partial resolution of the corneal perforation in the posterior stroma with remaining disorganization anteriorly. Peripheral thinning is also demonstrated in these images consistent with the diagnosis of PMD.</u>\n\n【14】In view of a relatively well-formed anterior chamber, absent lenticular corneal touch and low flow leakage, the leak was managed with a bandage contact lens was (PureVision2™, Bausch & Lomb, USA). In addition, she was given oral ciprofloxacin, topical levofloxacin and atropine. A review 24 h later showed a more formed anterior chamber, no iridocorneal touch and reduced rate of aqueous leakage. Topical steroids were added to her current regime and she was reviewed after 72 h.\n\n【15】At this time point the patient had a relatively well-formed anterior chamber, but there was ongoing leakage from the site of perforation. Due to the risk of infection, the patient had corneal cyanoacrylate glue applied with subsequent bandaging.\n\n【16】She was reviewed on a weekly basis for 7 weeks and during this period required two further gluing procedures. Corneal status was monitored with SS-ASOCT . At 9 weeks after initial presentation the perforation healed with no leakage and a small residual epithelial deficit . This was confirmed with SS-ASCOT .\n\n【17】The patient presented again 2 years after the original perforation with very similar symptoms in her fellow eye. Examination revealed an inferior rupture of Descemet’s membrane and a perforation at the 7 to 8 o’clock position with a brisk leak. ASOCT confirmed the perforation, and this was managed in the first instance with corneal gluing and anterior chamber reformation in theaters. This failed; so the patient subsequently had primary suturing of the perforation. At 12 weeks postoperatively her corneal sutures were removed uneventfully. Her visual acuity improved to 0.3LogMAR on pin hole in both eyes with a mild cataract.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】The underlying causes of corneal perforations are varied but can be broadly characterized into infectious and noninfectious causes. The noninfectious causes are related to four major pathologies: (i) severe ocular surface disease, (ii) autoimmune disease, (iii) trauma and (iv) corneal ectasias.\n\n【20】The clinical and topographical evidence of peripheral corneal thinning suggest that this is the most likely underlying mechanism of perforation in this case. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first reported case of spontaneous corneal perforation secondary to PMD that has been visualized using SS-ASCOT. It provided high-resolution imaging to assess the extent of perforation, degree of wound healing and eventual resolution.\n\n【21】The use of SS-OCT is widespread in the medical retina community due to its improved resolution (1 μm) and ability to image the choroid compared to spectral-domain OCT. The Triton SS-ASOCT 16-mm radius protocol provides a quick scan of the entire cornea, whereas the 6-mm scan provides a more detailed image of a selected area. This is useful for evaluating structural alterations that may not be detectable with larger scans. A number of studies have evaluated ASOCT features of acute hydrops with common findings of epithelial and stromal edema, intrastromal fluid and Descemet’s membrane detachment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Recently SS-ASOCT was used to evaluate corneas with LASIK flap-related complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and as adjunctive tool in evaluating the adherence of grafts post DMEK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It has also been shown to be an effective screening tool for the detection of early subclinical keratoconus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Nine-week anterior segment follow-up pictures showing that the perforation healed ( **A** ) with no leakage and no residual epithelial deficit ( **B** ). This was confirmed with SS-ASCOT showing the formation of stromal scar in the area previously perforated and localized thinning ( **C** ).</u>\n\n【23】While there is a general consensus for the management of larger perforations (>3 mm), the management of smaller perforations is not well defined. However, there are some important underlying principles. All patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye and an eye shield should be applied. Fluoroquinolones have been shown to have high transcorneal penetration, low rates of resistance and reduced hospital stays 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Cycloplegic agents can also be used in conjunction because they provide comfort and minimize adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The use of steroids is controversial. It has the potential to exacerbate infection but could minimize damage from the inflammatory response. Cohen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> support the notion that steroids should be started after the antibiotic has had time to take effect and the sensitivities are known. The use of a bandage contacts lenses has been shown to promote epithelial healing and minimize discomfort.

To date, multiple different clinical features of actinomycosis have been described, as various anatomical sites (such as face, bone and joint, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, digestive tract, central nervous system, skin and soft tissue structures) can be affected. Of note, in any site, actinomycosis frequently mimics malignancy, tuberculosis or nocardiosis, as it spreads continuously and progressively, and often forms a cold abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Pulmonary actinomycosis (PA) is a rare but challenging diagnosis to make. PA is commonly confused with other chronic suppurative lung diseases and with malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Compared to cervicofacial actinomycosis, which is the most frequent form of actinomycosis and constitutes 50–60% of the total actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, PA is more difficult to treat due to inapplicable surgical incision and drainage and a high relapse rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Here, we report the case of a patient who complained of persistent coughing and a mild fever at her first visit.

She had noticed a mild fever 2 weeks before the visit. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had a 12-pack-year smoking history and a 20-year history of persistent alcohol use with daily use of beer (298-g alcohol units per week). Her physical examination at our office visit was unremarkable.\n\n【11】The baseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 9200/μL (neutrophils 76.0%, lymphocytes 20.9%, eosinophils 0.2%); hemoglobin, 11.9 g/dL; platelet count, 325 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; blood urea nitrogen, 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.52 mg/dL; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; chlorides, 104 mEq/L; total protein, 6.8 g/dL; albumin, 3.6 g/dL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 3.36 mg/dL (↑); total bilirubin, 0.30 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 162 IU/L; glucose, 120 mg/dL (↑); hemoglobin A1c, 5.1%; carcinoembryonic antigen, 2.7 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 13.7 U/mL; _Chlamydophila pneumonia_ immunoglobulin A, 1.8 (↑) (0.0–0.9); _Chlamydophila pneumonia_ immunoglobulin G, 3.3 (↑) (0.0–0.9); and beta-D-glucan, 2.2 pg/mL. Urinary pneumococcal and _Legionella_ antigens were negative.\n\n【12】Chest radiograph revealed a mass-like consolidation in the right middle lung field with a poorly marginated, increased opacity in the right lower lung field . A computed tomography (CT) scan of the lung field revealed no underlying pulmonary disease except for consolidation in the right middle lobe as shown in Video 1 of the Supplementary material. The patient was treated with 400 mg/day of garenoxacin (GRNX) for 2 weeks after her refusal of bronchoscopy. Although the mass-like consolidation slightly decreased in size , it rather increased 2 weeks after GRNX treatment . WBC count and CRP also increased up to 12 100/μL (↑) and 9.68 mg/dL (↑), respectively. Bronchoscopy was performed after acceptance of an informed consent of the examination.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|HE stain of specimen obtained by bronchial brushing with bronchoscopy at right B4, showing a gram-positive filamentous branching organism, indicating _Actinomyces_ (magnification, ×1000).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Chest radiograph (postero-anterior view) revealing the decreased but remaining consolidation in the right middle lung field at 3 weeks of PCG treatment.

A total of 20 million units/day of benzylpenicillin (PCG) had been applied to the patient. At 2 weeks of PCG treatment, WBC counts and CRP were normalized, while the consolidation in the middle right lung field had shrunk but remained even 3 weeks of PCG administration . Finally, thoracoscopic resection of the right middle lobe was performed after 4-week PCG treatment upon the acceptance of an informed consent of the surgery.\n\n【17】Histopathology of the resected lobe showed necrotic tissues surrounded by inflammatory granulations. The necrotic tissues included sulfur granules  that comprised filamentous rods of _Actinomyces_ .\n\n【18】The patient received 6 months of oral amoxicillin following surgery. PA has not relapsed ~1.5 years after the surgery .\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】The peak incidence of PA was reported to be in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Men were more often affected than women, with a 3:1 ratio. PA mainly resulted from aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal secretions. Consequently, individuals with poor oral hygiene, preexisting dental disease and alcoholism had an increased risk for developing PA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These factors were likely to be predispositions of PA in our case. In fact, the patient had 15 treated teeth of total 26 teeth and 1 untreated cavity of a right maxillary cuspid, in addition to a 20-year history of persistent, daily alcohol use.\n\n【21】In the literature, a rate of treatment failure and recurrence of PA after antibiotics treatment was 15.1%, while that after surgical resections was 6.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, durations of antibiotic treatment were recommended to be individualized, and termination of treatment could be considered 1 or 2 months after complete clinical and radiological disease resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Early good responses to antibiotics could predict a successful treatment outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, surgical interventions including surgical drainage are important for a complete cure of PA, which might shorten the duration of antibiotics treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Of note, a patient with relapses of PA was reported to take ~4 years of antibiotics treatment with a refusal of surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case, both GRNX and PCG treatments were insufficient for a complete resolution of the lung lesion . PCG was effective for decreasing the size of the affected area but was not for the region of a right hilar nodule . Fluoroquinolones are usually considered to be inactive, but data are limited and controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. _In vitro_ studies showed that GRNX was effective for _Actinomyces_ spp. (0.5 and 1 mg/L of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50; see 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, respectively), although MIC50s of GRNX for _Actionomyces_ spp. were much higher than that for other anaerobic organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is still limited to determine whether GRNX is effective for a complete resolution of PA due to a short duration of the GRNX treatment and the involvement of necrotic tissues including sulfur granules  in the lung lesion in our case.\n\n【23】In summary, although PA was a challenging diagnosis to make, surgical intervention combined with intravenous and oral penicillin made a good recovery.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Takahiro Tuji, Department of Pathology, Sapporo City General Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, for performing histopathology for a surgically resected right middle lobe of the patient.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding to report for this case report.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required, as this was a clinical case.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient permission was obtained in writing.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Toshiki Ito.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This case was the largest ever reported and suggested that clinico-histological presentation of PSP sometimes showed an aggressive phenotype like advanced lung cancer.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) is a tumor classified as an adenoma, and the tumor is currently considered to originate from primitive respiratory epithelium based on immunohistochemical data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. The tumor clinically behaves in a benign manner and has a good prognosis. In some cases, however, PSP reportedly displays pathologically malignant characteristics such as lymph node metastases and necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These heterogenetic cases suggest that PSP has a clinico-pathological diversity. Herein, we present a case of a large PSP with massive necrosis and vascular invasions.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old woman presented with a cough and breathlessness. She was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow over the whole left chest area and a mediastinal shift on chest radiography . Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 15 × 14 × 10 cm mass filling almost the entire left thoracic cavity, which had an extensive low-density area on enhancement . There were also multiple nodules in the opposite lung . Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT revealed a mild Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation within the tumor in the left thorax and one nodule in the right lung, and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) were 6.5 and 2.3, respectively . Although the large tumor size, massive necrosis and the multiple nodules in the opposite lung suggested advanced lung cancer, the mild accumulation of FDG seemed atypical. Furthermore, her general condition was relatively good considering advanced cancer. Subsequent CT-guided tumor biopsy showed a proliferation of round cells with central bland nuclei and low nuclear atypia that were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and low Ki-67 labeling index (<5%). These findings raised PSP as a differential diagnosis in a multidisciplinary board. We, therefore, performed a left pneumonectomy to obtain the definite diagnosis and to palliate the symptoms caused by the rightward mediastinal shift.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Results of laboratory imaging techniques. ( **A** ) Chest radiography and ( **B** ) chest CT revealed a large mass measuring 15 × 14 × 10 cm in size present in the left lung with an extensive low-density area in the center of the tumor, thereby raising a suspicion of hemorrhage and necrosis; chest radiography also revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung. ( **C** ) Multiple small nodules ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 cm in diameter were also found in the right lung. One nodule was located in the upper lobe, and the others were in the lower lobe.

The tumor progressed expansively in the lungs and was well encapsulated. There were a dual population of cuboidal surface cells overlaying stromal round cells  with little nuclear atypia , showing various proliferation patterns: papillary, solid, sclerotic and hemorrhagic . There was no lymph node metastasis; however, endobronchial locations and vascular invasions were observed . The Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed overall labeling index of 5% with partially highly-proliferating areas of up to 30% . Tumor cells were positive for TTF-1, epithelial membrane antigen, progesterone receptor and vimentin and focally positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and cytokeratin-7 . The patient was consequently diagnosed as atypical PSP with massive necrosis and vascular invasions.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Unusual Pathological findings and IHC findings.

( **D** – **F** ) The tumor cells were positive for (D) TTF-1, (E) epithelial membrane antigen and (F) progesterone receptor.</u>\n\n【10】Six months after the primary surgery, the largest nodule in the right lung was resected because of increase in size from 1.3 to 1.9 cm and was diagnosed as PSP with similar pathological findings to the left lung tumor: dual population of tumor cells with various proliferation patterns, positivity of IHC, such as progesterone receptor, and multiple vascular invasions. We inferred that the nodules were multiple synchronous diseases, but it was difficult to distinguish from metastasis from the left tumor.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】PSP is relatively rare benign tumor with four distinct histological patterns: solid, papillary, sclerotic and hemorrhagic. According to some recent studies, PSP is considered to originate from primitive respiratory epithelium and is characterized as a tumor of pneumocytic origin with a dual population of cuboidal surface cells and stromal round cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Therefore, PSP was reclassified as adenoma from the previous category of miscellaneous tumors in the 2015 World Health Organization Classification, and its name was changed from ‘sclerosing hemangioma’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PSP clinically behaves in a benign manner. One study showed that the doubling time of PSP is 660–1250 days, which is slower than that of malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The prognosis after surgical resection is generally good, and deaths have not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】On the other hand, clinically malignant findings such as lymph node metastasis are reported to occur in approximately 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>, which makes difficult to distinguish from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (predominantly solid subtype). Histopathological characteristics such as dual population of tumor cells with little nuclear atypia, various proliferation patterns and IHC results confirmed the definitive diagnosis, however, the present case had some atypical characteristics for PSP as follows.\n\n【14】Firstly, the tumor size of 15 cm was noteworthy. Although two previous reports have reported PSPs of more than 10 cm, the present case was the largest one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Secondly, a massive necrosis, endobronchial lesion and multifocal lesions were observed. Previous reports showed that necrosis, multifocal and endobronchial lesion were rarely observed in PSP, and the incidences were 8% 4% and 1%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Thirdly, vascular invasion was observed, which has not been reported to date.\n\n【15】We did not perform genetic studies because its utility to distinguish synchronous PSPs from metastasis reportedly has not been established at this time. However, recent study of genetic analysis for multiple synchronous PSP identified mutations in genes, which may provide the clues to elucidate the nature of PSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Further, histopathological and genetic studies are very interesting and may clarify the feature and diversity of PSP.\n\n【16】In conclusion, this case suggested that PSP had a variety of histopathological findings and sometimes could show an aggressive clinical feature like advanced lung cancer.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National Cancer Center Hospital IRB approval number: 2017–418.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained comprehensive informed consent from the patient before this study.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

So far, many clinical features associated with COVID-19 illness remain under-identified, especially atypical manifestations. It is essential to characterize associated rare symptoms to better recognize complications. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) in severe infection manifesting as a generalized inflammatory reaction and immune response in many body systems, potential involvement of the male urogenital tract by SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.\n\n【2】Herein, we report a case of a pediatric patient with orchiepididymitis associated with COVID-19 infection, emphasizing the importance of considering other manifestations such as genital involvement of MIS-C in children with COVID-19 and highlighting the need to monitor the genitourinary function after infection. Therefore, andrological consultation is necessary to evaluate fertility as a long-term follow-up, especially as the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function are still to be thoroughly researched.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread, rare manifestations rise to our note affecting all age groups. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is still incompletely described, with many gaps in the course and complications of the disease remaining under-recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only one known case of pediatric orchiepididymitis in the setting of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and herein, we report the second of this kind and the first case with orchiepididymitis in a child in the context of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome with confirmed COVID-19 infection (MIS-C).\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 7-year-old boy without remarkable medical history presented to our hospital on December 2020 complaining of high fever (40°C) for more than 3 days, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, general fatigue and bilateral testicular discomfort developing over the past 2 days. At first, acute appendicitis was suspected but was later excluded. On physical examination he had reddish congested oral mucosa, dry cracked lips, pallor, generalized abdominal pain spreading to the iliac fossae, diffuse abdominal tenderness, generalized myalgias, sporadic erythematic rash in the inguinal region, the axilla and on the extremities . There was left-sided scrotal redness, increased warmth and swelling with testicular tenderness and pain which were worse on the left testis and was relieved with elevation, suggesting acute orchiepididymitis. This was confirmed upon consultation with the Urology department, in the absence of trauma.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Erythematosus rash on the right thigh with mildly elevated borders.</u>\n\n【8】Laboratory evaluation revealed lymphopenia: WBC:7 <sup>* </sup> 10 <sup>3 </sup> /ul, Plt:119 <sup>* </sup> 10 <sup>3 </sup> /ul, Lymphocytes:7%, Neutrophils:91%, CRP:131 mg/L. Urinalysis was normal. Chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a small amount of free peritoneal effusion located in the right iliac cavity and a small amount of clear fluid effusion in the scrotum, multiple hypoechogenic spots in the testis, and oedema in the epididymis with enlarged edematous epididymal caput . Scrotal Doppler ultrasonography could not be done in our hospital because of the pandemic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Ultrasonography of the testis shows inhomogeneous structure on echo, multiple hypoechogenic spots in the testis (A,B) and edema in the epididymis with enlarged edematous epididymal caput (C).</u>\n\n【10】The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit as he became hemodynamically unstable. Echocardiography showed pleural and pericardial inflammatory reactions. Computerized Tomography of the chest revealed minor alveolar infiltrations in the lower lobes. Differential Diagnosis was mostly suggestive of MIS-C infection with a very rare manifestation, orchiepididymitis. The school our patient attends documented an outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 infections.\n\n【11】Extended laboratory evaluations were consistent with MIS-C, D-dimer: 9400 ng/ml, procalcitonin: 29.8 ng/ml, Ferritin: 757 ng/ml, Antistreptolysine-O: 102tood units/ml, nasopharyngeal swab (real-time PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was treated as recommended by CDC and WHO Guidelines with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, then Prednisolone for 3 weeks, PPI: Omeprazole IV 1 mg/kg/12 h, IVIG (2 g/kg), Aspirin, Enoxaparin Sodium, Dopamine and Acetaminophen. On Day 3 of hospitalization, symptoms started improving after 12 h of IVIG administration as the generalized pain was lessened, scrotal pain and discomfort decreased gradually. On Day 6, the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and pain-free. Enoxaparin was continued until discharge on Day 10 with a normal blood panel, abdominal and testicular ultrasonography.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Acute orchiepididymitis most often presents unilaterally and results after urinary tract infection, viral infections (such as mumps, rubella, coxsackievirus, varicella, echovirus and cytomegalovirus), trauma or autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The frequency of orchiepididymitis in children has decreased substantially after the administration of mumps-measles-rubella vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Coronaviruses in pediatric patients cause either self-limiting mild infection or more severe infection that affects the whole body. MIS-C can be the severe manifestation in acute infection in children, or it can follow it as an autoimmune response with a severe clinical picture. Although rare, several genitourinary presentations have been reported, in addition to a few complications as a result of hypercoagulable states, such as priapism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】One case of orchiepididymitis secondary to SARS-CoV2 has been reported in a previously healthy 14-year-old male in Italy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; our case is the second orchiepididymitis to be reported so far secondary to COVID-19 infection and is the first to be represented in the context of MIS-C.\n\n【16】Genomic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is 76% identical to SARS-CoV, and they both share the main mechanism for invading cells through Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. ACE2 is mostly expressed in cells of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract and bladder, while the highest mRNA expression of ACE2 is in the testes suggesting that testicular cells might be the potential target of COVID-19. Some studies documented that SARS-Cov was detected in testicular epithelial cells and Leydig cells and caused orchitis, testicular lesions and widespread testicular germ cell destruction over a decade ago with subsequent spermatogenic tubule destruction, oligospermia and azoospermia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in the semen and testes and has been successfully isolated from the urine of COVID-19 patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. This might lead to orchiepididymitis by vas deferens reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, there are reports of scrotal discomfort and pain in males with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】During active viremia and persistent fever, the blood–testis barrier is tampered, thus raising the possibility of viral access to the male reproductive tract, notwithstanding, the systemic infection condition that causes an immunocompromised state could be responsible for the orchiepididymitis and other genitourinary manifestations or at least facilitate its presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. One study showed that COVID-19 caused immune impairment similar to the autoimmune orchitis observed previously in SARS-CoV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u> and documented impaired spermatogenesis in COVID-19 patients, which could later impair gonadal function and impact fertility in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, ‘are these results applicable to pediatric patients’ is an important question to be addressed. While complications of orchiepididymitis in normal children are infertility, testicular atrophy, and less commonly abscess formation, testicular infarction and reactive hydrocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, studies should investigate possible future complications of the genitourinary implication on patients infected with SARS-CoV in their childhood, especially as the role of ACE2 receptors is still incomplete at a young age and the gonadal function is yet to develop.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】As the SARS-CoV2 pandemic continues, clinicians should be aware that unusual presentations and rare complications are mostly under-recognized. The virus exhibits possible pathogenicity to testicular tissues; therefore, clinicians should pay attention to testicular complaints and must conduct future clinical follow-up and gonadal function evaluation, especially in patients who are at reproductive age.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgments.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was provided.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is needed.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Parental approval was provided.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Mariana Haydar is the guarantor of the paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Mild forms of non-inflammatory EBA are characterized by skin lesions and have gained great relevance in the literature. However, resistant inflammatory EBA with widespread mucosal involvement remains a rare entity given its low prevalence. It commonly represents a great burden for the patient’s quality of life with most cases being resistant to different therapeutic modalities. We present a case of resistant inflammatory EBA with esophageal strictures that improved after therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a well-defined acquired autoimmune disease that results from autoantibodies against anchoring fibrils within the basement membrane of collagen type VII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It can be divided into two subtypes: non-inflammatory and inflammatory. Non-inflammatory is the most common subtype, limited to skin lesions in body prone areas. In contrast, the inflammatory subtype has a widespread involvement and affects the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, larynx and esophagus. However, gastrointestinal tract involvement is rare, and its incidence is too low to be determined. We present an uncommon case presentation of EBA with esophageal strictures that improved with dilation, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and rituximab (RTX) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 71-year-old female with EBA and history of Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the right orbit in remission presented with non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting; associated dysphagia, odynophagia and unintentional weight loss of 8 lbs in the last 1 month. Physical exam was significant for scattered skin bullae throughout the body. There were oral ulcerations without visible thrush. The patient was started on lidocaine and Maalox cocktail, sucralfate and proton pump inhibitor with partial relief of symptoms. Barium swallow esophagram evidenced multiple stenotic areas . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed revealing extensive palate and laryngeal ulcers , along with erosive lesions and esophageal stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus . The lower esophagus and stomach were spared. The stenotic areas were successfully dilated with Savary dilators. Biopsy revealed ulcerative esophagitis with acute and chronic areas of inflammation that resulted negative for metaplasia, viral and fungal infections . The patient was initiated on IVIg and continued RTX with symptoms improvement.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Barium swallow esophagram with multiple areas of stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Multiple shallow ulcers in the oropharynx.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Area of stenosis in the upper third of the esophagus with sloughing of the surrounded mucosa.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Biopsy from the lower third of the esophagus.

Fibrin is seen in the space between the epithelium and stroma consistent with non-infectious inflammation and area of stenosis.</u>\n\n【10】Regarding the patient’s EBA, she had a long-standing history of progressive, widespread blisters, along with palate and laryngeal ulcers for the past 3 years, which previously failed steroids and dapsone treatment. Two months before presentation, the patient was started on RTX given the severe, non-remitting course of her EBA. The patient remained in complete remission with no further mucosal involvement for 5 months after the initial presentation and completing 5 cycles of IVIg, and RTX. On follow-up skin biopsy, dermatopathology analysis by immunofluorescence showed no deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA or C3 in the epidermis, dermis, basement membrane zone and vessels of the oral mucosa. The patient was discharged with dermatology and gastroenterology (GI) follow-up. No further GI symptoms were reported after 9 months of follow-up visits.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】EBA has a worldwide annual prevalence of 0.2% per 1 million people. It has been previously associated with Crohn’s disease (in 25–30% of reported cases), ulcerative colitis, along with other autoimmune disorders such as B cell lymphoma, amyloidosis, thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diabetes; out of which, the first three have only been proven by research trials. Histopathological analysis has shown evidence of circulating tissue antibodies against type VII collagen in B cell lymphoma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The treatment for EBA depends on the extent of the blistering lesions and their effect on the patient’s quality of life. First-line therapy for mild (local) disease is local vs systemic steroids; or steroid-sparing agents such as colchicine, dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. The classic feature of inflammatory EBA is the mucosal extension of the blistering lesions, which has been reported in 20% of cases and can be life-threatening. This subtype tends to be refractory to steroids and steroid-sparing agents. Nevertheless, IVIg along with other therapies such as humanized anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies (RTX) have shown positive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Gastrointestinal involvement of EBA is uncommon. The clinical presentation consists of multiple blisters and ulcer formation in the oral mucosa and palate region with progressive dysphagia, and/or odynophagia. There has been an established relationship between esophageal webs and EBA, reported in 6% of cases. The esophageal blistering/scarring process leads to the formation of fibrotic mucosa and esophageal stenosis. Management often encompasses dietary modification, sequential esophageal dilations with a balloon catheter or a bougie, and a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support. In one study with 53 patients, a total of 182 dilations were performed over a median follow-up period of 3.5 years. In total, 95% of the patients improved in the dysphagia score and weight. Possible risks are esophageal rupture and re-stenosis. Overall, endoscopic dilation is a safe procedure that provides symptom relief and improvement of the quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】One meta-analysis designed to study the efficacy of various treatments on remission showed that all EBA cases had a satisfactory response to IVIG and RTX independent of the disease severity. In a subgroup analysis, EBA with mucosal involvement was associated with complete remission. Furthermore, RTX and IVIG exhibited the best profile outcome for complete remission in severe EBA. However, it is not clear which mechanism RTX and IVIg use to execute their effect over susceptible autoantigenic B cell lymphocytes. IVIg is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its ability to eliminate clinical autoimmunity and restore physiologic homeostasis. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. These two agents might have a synergistic effect, but additional trials with larger samples are required. The length of therapy with IVIg and RTX is still controversial but expert consensus suggests that multiple cycles are necessary with a minimum length of 1 month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The goal of treatment is to control the disease and to avoid new lesion formation. The EBA inflammatory subtype prognosis is poor and 1-year remission off medication has not been widely proven in previous trials. Complete remission is uncommon without at least short courses of medical therapy.

Most medulloblastomas arising in adults are associated with mutations in the Sonic Hedge Hog (SHH) pathway. Patient 1 was prescribed Sonidegib for recurrent metastatic SHH mutated medulloblastoma multiple lines of treatment. His leptomeningeal disease responded after 3 months of therapy. The drug was continued for a further 3 months until progressive central nervous system (CNS) and leptomeningeal disease arose. Progression free survival (PFS) from initiation of Sonidegib of 3 months was observed (overall survival 8.8 years). Patient 2 presented with un-resectable SHH mutated meduloblastoma with high risk of relapse who received 14 months of adjuvant Sonidegib. Following biopsy she was treated with chemotherapy and cranio-spinal radiotherapy, followed by 14 months of adjuvant Sonigedib. She remains free of disease over 51 months later. Both clinical scenarios are poorly described in the literature or evaluated in clinical trials with Sonidegib.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Medulloblastomas are highly cellular embryonal malignant brain tumours presumed to originate from neuronal precursor cells exclusively in the cerebellum. Previous histological classifications have been superseded by molecular classification with four distinct molecular subtypes that carry variable prognosis. These subtypes include anomalies in Wingless-related integration site (Wnt), Sonic Hedge Hog (SHH) pathway, group 3 and group 4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although predominantly diagnosed in paediatric patients, medulloblastomas can occur in adults (<1% of adult brain tumours) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The majority of adult medulloblastomas (62%) are driven by mutations in the SHH pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】SHH mutations are thought to be oncogenic via induction of tumour cell proliferation pathways. SHH binds to the Protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) receptor which prevents smoothened (SMO) binding in its place. The unbound SMO then activates downstream pathways stimulating cell growth. The most common mutation leading to this aberrant pathway occurs in PTCH1 but can also be associated with activating SMO mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Medulloblastoma management involves a multimodal approach combining maximal safe surgicalx resection, adjuvant cranio-spinal radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed and multiagent chemotherapy regimens such as ifosfamide, cisplatin and etoposide (ICE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. Meta-analysis showed this combination approach significantly improves overall survival (108 months vs 57 months), but at the cost of significant treatment related toxicities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Recent development of SHH inhibitors (Sonidegib and Vismodegib), which inhibit activated SHH pathways by directly antagonizing SMO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, offer an emerging novel therapeutic option. These agents target the activated SHH oncogenic pathway in adult medulloblastomas and have the additional potential benefit of significantly less toxicities compared to established treatment protocols. A recent meta-analysis of early phase clinical trials in patients with SHH driven medulloblastoma showed a pooled objective response rate of 37% from treatment with either of the SHH inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Unlike the case series we present, the patients included in this meta-analysis were neither heavily pre-treated (Case 1) nor treated with SHH inhibitors in the adjuvant setting (Case 2). Furthermore the majority of the data of sonidegib in medulloblastoma (including the above meta-analysis) is from the paediatric setting. This is contrast to this case reports which describes Sonidegib in the adult setting.\n\n【7】CASE 1\n------\n\n【8】A 21-year-old male presented with headaches and nausea in September 2010. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mixed complex cystic/solid T2 FLAIR hyperintense, heterogeneously enhancing lesion occupying most of his left cerebellar hemisphere  resulting in significant mass effect and upstream hydrocephalus (Note all MRI studies in this report were performed on a 3.0 T 60 cm bore MR scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, US) or 3.0 T 70 cm bore MR scanner and a standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg, 0.2 ml/kg) of gadobenate dimeglumine was used for contrast imaging).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MRI with Axial T1 post-contrast (a/b) and Axial T2 FLAIR (c/d) demonstrate a large heterogeneously enhancing mass centred in the left cerebellar hemisphere with significant mass effect at diagnosis (a/c). After initial therapy with surgical debulking, ICE chemotherapy and cranio-spinal radiotherapy there was no residual enhancing disease (b) with significant reduction in non-enhancing T2 FLAIR signal (d).</u>\n\n【10】Following surgical debulking, histopathological classification confirmed the ‘classical’ type of medulloblastoma with local leptomeningeal involvement. Spinal MRI demonstrated no radiological evidence of leptomeningeal involvement at initial diagnosis, and three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations found no abnormal cytology. The patient received three cycles of ICE chemotherapy followed by cranio-spinal irradiation, 23.4 Gy in 13 fractions to spine, 36 Gy to whole brain and a total 59.4 Gy to the surgical bed. MRI brain at completion of chemoradiotherapy showed no residual enhancing disease on T1 post-contrast imaging and 88% volume reduction in the remaining non-enhancing hyperintense disease on T2 FLAIR imaging when compared to preoperative imaging . After initial treatment, the patient had good functional status and was able to return to work as a landscape gardener.\n\n【11】He remained in remission for 6 years, initially monitored with 3 monthly, then 6 monthly MRI scans. However, in September 2016 a 6 mm enhancing nodule appeared within the surgical bed which gradually increased in size over the following 4 months.\n\n【12】It was surgically resected in February 2017 and pathology revealed recurrent medulloblastoma with desmoplastic/nodular histological features. Molecular sequencing of this recurrent nodule revealed an activating mutation in the SMO pathway (PTCH1 p.516del NM\\_000264.3 c.1546\\_1548del), with biallelic loss of TP53. Further clinical staging, including CSF examination excluded disseminated CSF spread.\n\n【13】He received three further cycles of ICE chemotherapy with stem cell harvesting and then proceeded to tandem autologous bone marrow transplants in mid May 2017, four months after re-resection. The first transplant was conditioned with high dose carboplatin, thiotepa and etoposide and second with cyclophosphamide and melphalan. He recovered well and was again able to return to work.\n\n【14】In May 2018, 12 months post-transplant, a restaging MRI of brain and spine revealed local recurrence in the posterior fossa and new T9/10 nodular enhancement . He received further radiotherapy to the thoracic spine and posterior fossa totaling 35 Gy in 10 fractions.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Axial T1 post-contrast (a) and Sagittal T1 post-contrast FS cervico-thoracic spine (b) on follow-up imaging demonstrates recurrent nodular disease in the surgical bed (yellow circle) and new leptomeningeal along the surface of the spinal cord .</u>\n\n【16】In September 2018, 4 months post re-irradiation, an MRI whole spine confirmed leptomeningeal spread of the disease and progression at the previously irradiated thoracic spine, as well as bone metastases ; the patient was commenced on Sonidegib with an initial dose of 200 mg daily. It was up-titrated to 600 mg over 2 months, however the patient developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 diarrhoea and Sonidegib was withheld. Following a 2 week wash out, Sonidegib was reinitiated again at the lower dose of 200 mg daily. By December 2018, the leptomeningeal disease had responded, however, multiple sclerotic boney metastases had appeared in the cervical and thoracic spine; the patient was asymptomatic at the time. In February 2019, after 5 months of treatment, the patient had improvement in spinal leptomeningeal disease on MRI but worsening bony metastatic disease and marked intra-cranial progression . Due to the observed clinical benefit, Sonidegib was continued and the patient received a course of palliative radiotherapy to the posterior fossa lesion (35 Gy in 10 fractions).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|MRI brain and whole spine with Axial T1 post-contrast (a–c) and sagittal T1 post-contrast FS (d–f) following commencement of Sonidegib.

However, over time there was marked progression of intracranial disease (blue circles) and increased bony metastatic disease (red circles) which preceded further intracranial leptomeningeal spread prior to transition to palliative care.</u>\n\n【18】In April 2019, after a total of 6 months of Sonidegib treatment, the intracranial, leptomeningeal and bony metastatic disease all progressed, and all active treatment was ceased. The patient died 6 weeks later, 8.8 years from time of initial diagnosis.\n\n【19】CASE 2\n------\n\n【20】A 56 year-old female presented in June 2017 with an 18-month history of mild ataxia and acute onset headaches. MRI revealed an ill-defined non-enhancing mass centred on the cerebellar vermis with local mass effect . Due to the extent of disease and location, gross total resection was not feasible and the tumour was biopsied with posterior fossa suboccipital craniectomy decompression. Histopathology revealed a ‘classical’ medulloblastoma and molecular analysis was consistent with an SHH activated medulloblastoma via SMO mutation (p.W535L NM\\_005631 C.1604G > T) without TP53 mutation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Axial T2 FLAIR (a), Coronal T1 post-contrast (b) and T2 (c) demonstrates a T2 FLAIR hyperintense mass lesion centred on the vermis  in keeping with medulloblastoma.

She was treated with three cycles of ICE, followed by cranio-spinal irradiation receiving 36 Gy in 20 fractions with a tumour cavity boost to 59.4 in 1.8 Gy/fraction. MRI brain on completion of radiotherapy, 5 months after post-operative imaging, showed significant volume reduction of 49% on T2 weighted imaging when compared with post-operative imaging (0.98 cm <sup>2 </sup> vs 1.89 cm <sup>2 </sup> ) with no enhancement seen on post-contrast imaging. At the patient’s request, adjuvant Sonidegib 200 mg daily was commenced in September 2018.\n\n【23】Although higher doses (usually 800 mg), are used in clinical trials, data from a basal cell carcinoma trial demonstrated equal efficacy between 200 mg and 800 mg daily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Given this data and in the interest of limiting dose toxicity in the adjuvant setting, she remained on 200 mg daily for 14 months. Treatment was well-tolerated, with only CTCAE grade 2 alopecia and no severe adverse events. Ongoing surveillance shows no evidence of recurrence or progression on MRI 51 months following diagnosis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Long-term follow-up imaging with Axial T2 FLAIR (a/c) and Coronal T2 (b/d) shows stable T2 FLAIR signal and stable T2 signal with mild interval atrophy of the vermis (red box).

The role and timing of SHH inhibitors in managing this disease will need further study in clinical trials, however these will be limited by their low occurrence rate.\n\n【27】These two case reports demonstrate the drug was well-tolerated given at a dose of 200 mg daily. Case 1 showed leptomeningeal response after failing a number of cytotoxic agents and at a time of large tumour burden. Although the response was limited to intra-cranial disease, given this patient was heavily pre-treated, any response bares significance. In Case 2 Sonigedib was given in the adjuvant setting following chemotherapy and radiation. Due to limited surgery she is at high risk of recurrence, but remains disease free 51 months after diagnosis.\n\n【28】Both cases also showed potential clinical benefit of Sonidegib. The benefit criteria for Case 1 was the demonstrated transient improvement in leptomeningeal disease as well as clinical benefit in this heavily pre-treated patient. The benefit criteria for Case 2 is the ongoing progression free survival in the adjuvant setting for a high-risk patient in whom gross total resection could not be performed. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first example of Sonigedib use in both these settings.\n\n【29】The use of Sonedigib in these settings warrants further investigation in the form of randomized control trials. This may enable its adoption into earlier lines of therapy in medulloblastoma treatment paradigms, with the hope of reducing the need for aggressive combination chemotherapy and cranio-spinal irradiation.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge the following people/organizations: Royal North Shore Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology and Palliative Care health staff who care for these patients.

However, in rare cases, some of them cause gastrointestinal penetration and require treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no cases of gastric penetration of fish bones that were treated conservatively with antibiotics alone. Patients with gastric penetration or perforation caused by fish bones can follow various clinical courses.

Her abdominal pain gradually increased, and she was brought to our hospital by ambulance 2 days later. Laboratory investigation showed an increased white blood cell count of 14 000 mm <sup>3 </sup> and a C-reactive protein level of 10.13 mg/dl on arrival. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a linear high-intensity structure that penetrated the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach outside the stomach wall, along with inflammatory findings outside the stomach wall and thickening of the stomach wall. No evidence of penetration into other organs was observed . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed scars on the anterior wall of the antrum, but no fish bones could be detected. No linear high-intensity echo could be confirmed even with endoscopic ultrasonography. She was treated conservatively with antibiotics alone. Follow-up CT after 2 months showed that the inflammatory findings had disappeared , as well as the symptoms. She is currently being followed carefully.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT shows a linear high-intensity structure (arrow) that penetrates the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach outside the stomach wall ( **A** : cross section, **B** : coronal section).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Follow-up CT after 2 months showed that inflammatory findings disappeared (arrow).</u>\n\n【10】### Case 2\n\n【11】A 69-year-old woman ate grilled fish 4 days earlier. She developed epigastric pain that increased gradually, so she consulted her family doctor. Laboratory investigation showed an increased white blood cell count of 16 100 mm <sup>3 </sup> and a C-reactive protein level of 29.89 mg/dl. Because of the high inflammatory findings, she was referred to our hospital. She was taking warfarin and aspirin after undergoing aortic and mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve plasty. Abdominal CT showed a linear, high-intensity structure that penetrated the posterior wall of the antrum of the stomach outside the stomach wall, and inflammatory findings outside the stomach wall and thickening of the stomach wall . The findings suggested that the tip of the fish bone may have been stuck in the pancreas. A hematoma was seen in the retroperitoneum . The patient’s general condition was poor, and endoscopy could not be performed. Although a surgeon was consulted, the patient was treated with antibiotics because of heart disease and oral antithrombotic drugs. The oral antithrombotic drugs obviously had an effect on her condition, particularly the hematoma, but the penetration of fish bones into the pancreas was a serious problem. A few days later, surgery was considered because of the growing hematoma and penetration into the pancreas, but it was postponed due to a severe heart attack for which she required intensive care to prepare for surgery. However, surgery was not performed because of serious cardiac complications, no pancreatic organ damage and control of the hematoma. She is under close follow-up after discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT shows a linear high-intensity structure (arrow) that penetrates the posterior wall of the antrum of the stomach outside the stomach wall ( **A** : cross section, **B** : sagittal section).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|A hematoma is found in the retroperitoneum (arrow).</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Since about 80–90% of accidentally swallowed foreign bodies pass through the digestive tract as they are, they result in few clinical problems. It has been reported that the frequency of gastrointestinal penetration by foreign bodies is <1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Gastric penetration by a fish bone is rare, accounting for only a few percent of cases of gastrointestinal penetration by a fish bone. The penetration site is in the antral region in 46% of cases, followed by the gastric angle in 15% of cases, with most cases in the lower part of the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is considered that the fish bone is stagnant due to the pyloric ring, and movement due to peristalsis is large. The treatment is surgery or endoscopic removal. If a fish bone is stuck in the stomach wall, it can only be removed by surgery. If the fishbone is visible through the gastric cavity, endoscopic removal is often performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Based on the experience of these two cases, it is possible that the subsequent course may change depending on whether the penetration is from the antrum to the anterior wall or to the posterior wall. In the case of anterior wall penetration, it often does not penetrate other organs, so that if the fish bone is covered with granulation, it may be possible to follow-up conservatively. There was one interesting case report. Although surgery was performed on chronic cases, the penetrated foreign body was granulated and was completely isolated from the abdominal cavity, and no inflammation spread to the surroundings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It should be noted that there have been reports of cases in which an abscess was formed by penetration of the liver from the antral lesser curvature of the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. When penetrating the posterior wall, many cases penetrating to the pancreas have been reported. In general, surgery is often the choice for patients with penetration of the pancreas because of mass formation or infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Although the present report is based only on a clinical case series, it appears that the subsequent course may differ depending on which direction the fish bone penetrates the stomach. Diagnostic imaging is very important for cases of gastric antral penetration of fish bone, since the course and treatment may differ depending on the direction of penetration.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】These two cases show that the course and treatment of fish bones that penetrate the gastric antrum may differ depending on the direction of penetration.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Ms. Noriko Arai for secretarial support.

She was diagnosed with ASS based on the presence of arthritis, ILD, anti-Jo1 and antiRo52 autoantibodies. She was maintained on 6-monthly Rituximab cycles (one 1gm infusion repeated 15 days after the first for each cycle), completed two cycles, last given 6 months prior to her presentation. In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic the third cycle was withheld and Azathioprine was commenced which she took for 2 weeks. Two weeks prior to her admission Azathioprine was switched to an up titrating dose of Mycophenolate due to nonspecific symptoms of headache and dizziness attributed to possible medication intolerance. She was admitted with fever, abdominal pain and headaches. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia (38.3C), hypotension (109/70 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 94 bpm) and palmar maculopapular rash. Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia, Hb 100 (115–165 g/L), WCC 2.40 (4–11 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), Platelets 61 (150–450 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), Neutrophils 1.75 (2–7 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), lymphocytes 0.50 (1– 4 × 10^9/L), Ferritin of >55 000 (15–300 ug/L), Triglycerides 4.3 (1.8 mmol/L), LDH 1200 (135–214 IU/L), Fibrinogen 2.8 g/l(normal), ALT 108 (<34 IU/L), CRP 141 (0–6 mg/L) and ESR 24 mm/hr.\n\n【6】A septic screen for common bacterial and viral pathogens including parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis was negative. Multiple covid-19 swabs were negative. Computed tomography of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or an underlying malignancy. Lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, evolving pancytopenia, elevated ferritin and persistent fever with patient’s background history of autoimmune disease raised concerns about MAS. She fulfilled the 2014 HScore by Fardet _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> with a score of 199 (cut off 169), Treatment with IV methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days was initiated followed by oral prednisolone, 60 mg along with ciclosporin 2 mg/kg/d. She had a history of type 2 diabetes, was on oral hypoglycaemic medications but developed hyperglycaemia and ketosis secondary to steroid and required Insulin therapy. Anakinra 100 mg once daily subcutaneously was added after Multidisciplinary team discussion to reduce steroid toxicity and facilitate a rapid steroid taper, whilst providing optimal disease control. Immediate clinical improvement was noted with normalization of fevers and gradual normalization of laboratory abnormalities including ferritin, cell counts  and inflammatory markers. We believe an underlying rheumatic immune disorder was the likely predisposing factor for the development of MAS in our patient, as she was not maintained on biologic/immunomodulatory therapy due to paused Rituximab in view of COVID-19 pandemic and possible intolerance to various agents.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|H score.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Progression of serum ferritin and white cell count.</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by an unregulated inflammatory response with cytokine storm leading to multisystem organ failure and can be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly. HLH can be familial (primary) or acquired (secondary to infection, malignancy or active autoinflammation). Secondary HLH (sHLH) in association with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, adult-onset Still disease, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is known as MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, it is rarely seen in patients with ASS and has been described only in case reports where most patients reportedly suffered from dermatomyositis. Anti- Jo-1, anti- Mi-2 and anti-MDA-5 autoantibodies have been found in cases of idiopathic inflammatory myositis complicated by MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis is often challenging due to clinical manifestations mimicking sepsis, active autoimmune diseases and lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Various tools have been developed which use clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities to risk-stratify patients but have limitations. The H-score by Fardet _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> has been validated for the diagnosis of reactive HLH and subsequently showed good diagnostic accuracy in an observational study by Knaak _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, clinical judgement and awareness of the condition remains paramount in diagnosis. Timely diagnosis and treatment to reduce systemic inflammation is imperative to reduce high mortality. High-dose glucocorticoid monotherapy is usually the first line treatment with subsequent addition of immunomodulatory agents in refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Over recent years, various biologics and immunotherapies have been used successfully for MAS treatment. This also includes Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist used in various autoinflammatory diseases. Although limited, there are now case reports and series showing favourable response to anakinra, both subcutaneously and intravenously in sHLH subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Its use is also appealing due to relatively short half-life that permits its discontinuation if an adverse effect occurs or concern for worsening infection arises.\n\n【11】Our case was challenging as patient initially manifested joint symptoms with positive immunology for RA and later developed ILD with positive ASS immune profile in the absence of clinical myositis, typical skin rash and normal CK levels. Aminoacyl tRNA positivity has been described in patients who fulfilled RA diagnostic criteria in the literature and hence ASS is an important clinical condition in the differential diagnosis of early RA. It has been reported that development of myositis can take years after onset of arthritis and ILD, which are also not rarely seen before myositis and in some myositis never occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The most common arthritis pattern seen in ASS is small joint symmetrical polyarthritis quite similar what seen in RA. AntiCCP and rheumatoid factor positivity can be observed in ASS and lead to false RA diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. On the other hand, established knowledge that ASS is seen in cases with classical RA is quite limited. Current literature regarding the use of anakinra in cases of adult MAS is limited, further information regarding its effectiveness and potential clinical benefits and risks is needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, however, we had a successful response and outcome in resistant MAS associated with ASS using anakinra.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No specific funding was received from any funding bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>An informed consent for publication has been obtained, Identifying details of the.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient have not been used in this case report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Nadia Ahmad, nadiaahmad@ live.co.uk</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, Rheumatology.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Our case is the first case that depicts development of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) following infection with COVID-19, with a challenging diagnosis and spontaneous improvement. A 65-year-old diabetic female presented with a complete external ophthalmopegia in the left eye and a severe left-sided headache. The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Brain and orbital computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were both unremarkable. We diagnosed the case as THS after ruling out other differential diagnoses. The patient refused to receive prednisone, so we had to observe her closely for 6 months during which period we recorded a spontaneous recovery. Acute ophthalmoplegia is a very challenging presentation. It needs full workup to exclude the wide range of differential diagnoses.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Since the start of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, a number of both benign and vision-threatening neuro-ophthalmic manifestations have been documented in COVID-19 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> of which we cite optic neuritis, nystagmus, visual field abnormalities, headache, diplopia, visual impairment, ocular pain, Miller Fisher syndrome and painful cranial neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cranial neuropathies, especially painful ophthalmoplegia, have a wide range of differential diagnoses, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Here, we have a rare case of complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with unremarkable radiological findings and spontaneous remission through long-term observation.\n\n【5】The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 65-year-old Caucasian female with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was admitted to our ophthalmology department. She presented with left periocular pain, droopy eyelid and left ocular movement limitation for a period of 4 days. Two weeks before admission, she had had a severe left-sided headache unresponsive to sedatives, along with fatigue, dry cough and fever. The patient denied any history of trauma or recreational drug use.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed a complete external ophthalmoplegia on the left eye and total left ptosis with a mild chemosis. The pupil was semi-dilated and non-reactive to light. We also recorded mild proptosis on Hertel exophthalmometer (3-mm discrepancy between the two eyes). Uncorrected visual acuity was 0.6 (0.18 LogMAR), intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg and Ishihara color test was normal .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Photograph of the patient in six positions at the presentation, showing prominent ophthalmoplegia in the left eye.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was conscious, oriented and responsive to stimuli. Tendon reflexes and muscle tone were all within normal limits. There were no meningeal or cerebellar signs. Ear, nose and throat examinations were within normal as well. Sensory system examination was totally normal at presentation. However, a left corneal hypoesthesia appeared 2 days after admission, which was consistent with an injury in the first branch of the fifth cranial nerve.\n\n【11】Laboratory studies (including CBC, PT, INR, D-Dimer, ferritin, urea, LDH, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, sodium, potassium and calcium) were all within normal limits. By contrast, C-reactive protein was elevated (11.4 mg/l) and so was blood glucose (300 mg/dl).\n\n【12】Polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was positive, and brain and orbital computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both unremarkable. There was no sign of inflammation nor of a mass.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) was made after the exclusion of other pathologies. The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 unit for close observation and blood glucose control and for the overall management of her COVID-19 symptoms. Brain MRI was normal upon its repetition after a week.\n\n【14】The patient’s status later improved, and she was discharged home with monthly reviewing.\n\n【15】On follow-up, her ocular symptoms and signs started to improve spontaneously 3 months after admission. A regression in the ptosis, a partial recovery in the third and fourth cranial nerves were detected. She could adduct, elevate and depress the left eye into primary and adduction positions.\n\n【16】Corneal sensation was recovered 5 months after presentation. She could fully open her left eye. The pupil became round, regular and reactive to light, but she was unable to abduct the eye. This meant a complete spontaneous restoration of the third, fourth and first branches of the fifth cranial nerve .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Photograph of the patient in nine positions after 5-month follow-up, showing improvement in the eye movements except for the sixth nerve in the left eye.</u>\n\n【18】By the end of the 6-month period, all the involved nerve functions were restored except for the sixth nerve and the patient ended up with exotropia. At present, the patient is complaining of diplopia and is being prepared for strabismus surgery.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Reports of neuro-ophthalmic complications in COVID-19 patients, such as cranial nerve paresis, optic neuritis and gaze palsy, are being increasingly described in the literature. This is a case of an infrequent presentation of painful complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with radiologically normal imaging. We documented the natural course of the spontaneous remission of the neuropathies with no treatment.\n\n【21】Cranial nerve palsies with COVID-19 were reported. However, to our knowledge, this is the first case to report a concomitant four cranial nerves palsies, CN III, IV, V and VI.\n\n【22】Ophthalmoparesis has a wide range of differential diagnoses; multiple sclerosis, neoplasms, malignancies, giant cell arteritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, THS, diabetes mellitus and cavernous sinus thrombosis.\n\n【23】In this specific case, there was acute severe complete external ophthalmoplegia, left corneal hypoesthesia, total ptosis and mild proptosis, with a history of severe headache and cough. We made the diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) after ruling out all the other pathologies.\n\n【24】Our patient had normal CT and MRI with no signs of masses or hyperintensity at presentation. They were also normal on repetition after a week. We could not use gadolinium for it was unavailable in our hospital.\n\n【25】Although the patient had uncontrolled diabetes, the clinical presentation was far from the classic presentation of diabetic ophthalmoplegia; it indicated a pathology in the orbital apex rather than only a diabetic ischemia. Our patient had severe and acute paralysis of three cranial nerves simultaneously, and all the nerves enter the cranial cavity through the orbital apex. As well as, the sensitive part of the fifth nerve was injured. Based on clinical presentation and MRI findings, we were able to rule out the most notable differential diagnoses and make the diagnosis of THS. The THS diagnosis is a triad of one or more episodes of unilateral orbital pain, paresis of one or more of the cranial nerves and granulomas in MRI or biopsy; which is sensitive for the diagnosis of the syndrome. However, the fact that over half of the reported cases had normal MRI renders the diagnosis dependent on the exclusion of other etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The patient was not given the corticosteroids treatment at her demand. She showed spontaneous remission and had to be monitored over a 6-month period.\n\n【27】Since our patient was positive for COVID-19, and there was no detection of any other possible etiology such as other infections, trauma, tumor or malignancy, we theorize that the SARS-COV-2 virus may have triggered an immunological reaction leading to the development of the ophthalmoplegia, which we believe is THS.\n\n【28】Our case is the first to report the development of complete acute ophthalmoplegia following COVID-19 infection with normal MRI and spontaneous improvement.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to express our great appreciation to Mr Zain Hummamy for his valuable efforts toward ensuring both the linguistic correctness and the linguistic accuracy of the study.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors does not have any conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this work.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images were obtained from the patient.

Patients can present with a range of symptoms from a mild chronic abdominal pain to those of an acute abdomen. We present a rare case of abdominal fibromatosis that presented as a rapidly growing mass with free intraperitoneal gas. Intraoperatively however, we found a large tumour arising from the wall of the transverse colon and local necrosis. No bowel perforation was noted. The tumour was removed with a wide resection of transverse colon’s wall instead of colectomy. The histopathology reported benign fibromatosis and excluded malignancy.\n\n【2】abdominal fibromatosis , aggressive fibromatosis , desmoid , intestinal perforation , colonic neoplasms\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a rare condition that can involve many organs of the human body including intrabdominal ones. Histologically, fibromatosis is an abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumours (DTs) are very rare and usually occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This is a report of a rare case of benign DT of the colon presenting as a perforated malignancy and being treated surgically with complete resection.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 51-year-old lady presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized abdominal pain. The patient did not report any associated symptoms. She had had similar episodes in the recent past, but the symptoms were minor and resolved on their own. Her past medical history included a recent admission to ED with renal colic and a computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen which was clear . She did not report any weight loss. The abdominal examination revealed tenderness, mainly in the left side of the abdomen, but no signs of peritonitis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|The CT scan abdomen that patient had 6 months prior to the presentation to the ED with renal colic. ( **A** ) Coronal, ( **B** ) sagittal and ( **C** ) axial.

The rest of the values were unremarkable, including lactates. She was tachycardic, but she was haemodynamically stable. Chest X-ray showed no free air under diaphragm. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed free intraperitoneal gas indicating a hollow viscus perforation. A 9.2 × 6.1 cm lesion in the mesentery, which at that time was of uncertain aetiology, was also found. The report mentioned that although the mass was inseparable from the transverse colon superiorly, it did not appear to arise from this and maintained a clear plane to the small bowel loops. The mass was of heterogeneous attenuation measuring up to 50 Hounsfield units. Further review of the scans with the consultant radiologist suggested the presence of a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumour or a desmoid .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT of the abdomen and pelvis preoperatively. ( **A** ) Coronal, ( **B** ) sagittal and ( **C** ) axial. The location and the size of the tumour are obvious. Also, the locules of gas are seen in (A) and (B).</u>\n\n【10】Subsequent to the imaging and clinical findings, a decision for surgical exploration was made. A midline laparotomy was performed and a large tumour was discovered. Its wall was well defined, and it was arising from the wall of the transverse colon. The omentum was covering a part of the tumour that looked necrotic . As the tumour seemed extraluminal and benign, it was decided to proceed with wide resection of the wall of the colon. A linear staple (80 mm) was applied on the transverse colon , and the tumour was removed en bloc with the part of the colonic wall and the omentum that was covering it . The rest of the intraperitoneal cavity was explored for possible deposits or tumours, and it was negative.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The tumour was arising from the antimesenteric border of the transverse colon.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Resection of the tumour with a linear staple (80 mm) that was applied on the transverse colon.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Specimen. Posterior side. En bloc resection of the tumour with the part of the colonic wall and the omentum that was covering it.</u>\n\n【14】The histopathology confirmed benign fibromatosis. Macroscopically, the specimen was described as a 90 × 85 × 60 mm round mass of white tissue with attached omental fat 310 × 170 × 25 mm with no evidence of perforation. Microscopically, a spindle cell lesion composed of fascicles in places with a perpendicular pattern was revealed. The tumour cells showed diffuse nuclear staining for beta catenin and they were negative for S100, CD34, CD117 and desmin. Mitoses were seen scattered and typical in morphology excluding colonic malignancy. It was a margin-negative (R0) resection.\n\n【15】The patient had an uneventful post-operative period. The case was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), and it was decided to continue follow-up with interval scans without chemoradiotherapy. The CT scans 6 and 12 months post-operatively showed no recurrence or signs of metastatic disease or lymphadenopathy.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The word desmoid comes from the Greek word desmos, which means tendon-like 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These are locally aggressive tumours that histopathologically contain of proliferating myofibroblasts which make them solid and tough. They can be classed as extra-abdominal, intra-abdominal and within the abdominal wall. They are more common in the female gender, and evidence suggests that oestrogen levels effect their growth. Although DTs do not metastasize, their recurrence rate is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】We present the first case report in literature describing a DT arising from the transverse colon of a patient who presented with acute abdomen and underwent an emergency laparotomy and wide resection without extended colectomy. There are three case reports in literature describing a colonic DT, one was a finding in an elective and two in an emergency setting, but in all of those cases, patients finally underwent a hemicolectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】DF remains an enigmatic disease with a variable course that can range from an incidental small tumour that can remain small and stable or become large and grow rapidly, causing death in a matter of months or years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our case, there was no evidence seen in the CT scan that was done 6 months prior to the patient’s presentation in the ED. The latter, together with the large size of the tumour (9.2 × 6.1 cm), means that its growth was rapid. Furthermore, DT can become mobile as they are attached or originated from the mesentery. Therefore, a characteristic of the DT of the abdominal cavity is that they can potentially remain asymptomatic for a long period of time before becoming symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】In our case, a colonic DT mimicking a hollow viscus perforation can be anticipated as diagnosis. Even though free intraperitoneal gas had been seen in the CT, no bowel perforation was noted intraoperatively. As the tumour had a necrotic area, covered with omentum, it seems that the gas was originating from the tumour necrosis. Finally, no perforation was described macroscopically in the histopathology report.\n\n【21】The surgical management of gastrointestinal fibromatosis is governed by the location, size and local invasion of the tumour. R0 resection has historically been the gold standard for the treatment of abdominal wall and intra-abdominal DTs; however, microscopically positive margin resection is acceptable, as recurrence rates may not be significantly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, it was a R0 resection with >1 cm margin, and after 1 year, there was no sign of recurrence. It is important that we did not have to proceed with extensive colonic resection and anastomosis. However, the intraoperative decision to proceed with a colectomy or local excision is a challenge. A preoperative and or an intraoperative discussion with a colorectal specialist is ideal even though this is not always feasible in an emergency situation. In case of a doubt or limited experience in colorectal surgery, the operating surgeon should proceed with colectomy in order to ensure negative resection margins.\n\n【22】DT of the colon is a very rare and aggressive type of intra-abdominal DF. Patients with colonic DT can present with a range of symptoms from a mild chronic abdominal pain to those of an acute abdomen. CT is an essential tool for the final diagnosis. The surgeon should review the scans together with the consultant radiologist in order to form the best plan preoperatively and intraoperatively. Complete resection of the tumour with negative margins macroscopically prevents local recurrence. The decision of an extended resection of the involved bowel or just local excision should be made intraoperatively depending on the tumour’s location, local invasion and surgeon’s experience. An MDT discussion, as well as follow-up, is mandatory.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

Protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha ( _PRKAR1A_ ) is known to be the responsible gene. Breast myxomatosis and ductal adenoma, which are regarded as benign, are well-known mammary lesions of CNC and are included in the main diagnostic criteria. In this case, a 59-year-old woman with repeated cardiac myxoma was diagnosed with CNC with _PRKAR1A_ mutation. She also had three multiple breast tumours bilaterally: breast cancer, adenomyoepithelioma and intraductal papilloma. In mammary lesions of CNC, attention should be paid to benign lesions, such as breast myxomatosis or ductal adenomas, and the development of breast cancer or breast tumours with malignant potential. Mammary lesions should be aggressively scrutinized and considered for resection, as required.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Carney complex (CNC) is a multiple tumour syndrome characterized by cutaneous pigmented lesions, myxoma mainly on the skin/heart/breast and endocrine or neural tumours, among others. CNC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by inactivating mutations of the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha ( _PRKAR1A_ ) gene. In families affected by CNC, 62% had a detectable _PRKAR1A_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. _De novo_ mutations in _PRKAR1A_ have been detected in about one-third of CNC cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. For mammary gland lesions, breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenomas are included in the CNC’s main diagnostic criteria; however, the involvement of breast cancer and other breast tumours is currently not clearly known. Herein, we encountered a CNC case with multiple breast tumours that were not myxomatosis or breast ductal adenoma but breast cancer, adenomyoepithelioma (AME) and intraductal papilloma (IDP).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 59-year-old woman presented with a mass in the breast. Family history revealed that her father had skin cancer in his 60s, and her paternal aunt had osteosarcoma in her 40s. Her medical history was as follows : in 2005, she underwent a right breast tumourectomy and was diagnosed with IDP. In 2011, left breast cancer was detected, and preoperative screening echocardiography coincidentally revealed left atrial myxoma; cardiac surgery was performed to remove the myxoma. In 2012, left breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed; infiltrating elements of histological grade 1, measuring 13 mm, were observed in the lesion. On immunohistochemical examination, neoplastic cells were positive for oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (total Allred scores: 8 and 8, respectively). The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 score was 1+ in invasive neoplastic cells. The final diagnosis was stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma (pT1cN0M0), luminal subtype. Tamoxifen was administered as adjuvant hormone therapy based on pathological findings. Additionally, the patient underwent whole left breast radiotherapy (42.56 Gy). In 2016, she was diagnosed with right atrial myxoma and underwent cardiac surgery again. CNC was suspected because of repeated cardiac myxoma, and she was confirmed to meet the CNC diagnostic criteria. Moreover, genetic testing revealed a _PRKAR1A_ pathogenic variant. Conversely, genetic testing to identify germline mutations in other genes, such as _BRCA1/2_ , was not performed. Additionally, somatic gene mutations in breast cancer were not investigated. In 2020, she developed a new right breast mass . Physical examination revealed ocular conjunctiva, and pigmentation was observed in the right eye; brown spotty skin pigmentation was observed on the lips, surrounding area and anterior chest . The right breast mass was described as a complicated cyst on mammography and ultrasonography ; needle biopsy confirmed atypical ductal hyperplasia. Therefore, a right breast tumourectomy was performed . Based on histopathological findings , the final diagnosis was AME of the breast. Since the tumour was resected, the post-operative policy was regular follow-up without additional treatment. Currently, no apparent recurrence or metastasis of any breast tumour has been observed.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Important timelines.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Physical findings in 2020.

First, CNC could be relevant to the bilateral development of multiple breast tumours, other than breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenoma. Second, in mammary lesions of CNC, attention should be paid to the occurrence of breast cancer or breast tumours with malignant potential.\n\n【13】The most common CNC-associated mammary tumour is breast myxomatosis, which occurs in ~20% of female patients after puberty and is often bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Second, ductal adenoma also often occurs, with a frequency of ~3% in female patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Both are considered benign lesions; reports of malignant transformation in patients are unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in a report investigating 338 patients with CNC, only one patient (0.3%) had breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a CNC case with breast cancer, AME and IDP.\n\n【14】Breast lesions commonly found in patients with CNCs are generally benign and unlikely to significantly impact prognosis. However, _PRKAR1A_ is associated with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> because the protein kinase A signal is activated by _PRKAR1A_ loss and promotes mammary tissue carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, attention should be paid to breast cancer complications, especially in patients with CNC with _PRKAR1A_ mutation, as in this case. Conversely, AME is a rare tumour characterized by biphasic proliferation of ductal epithelium and myoepithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. AME is associated with a spectrum of diseases, ranging from benign to malignant tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>; hence, surgical resection is often considered. Appropriate tissue biopsy is important to ensure that these lesions are not overlooked.\n\n【15】This is an unusual case of three different breast tumours—breast cancer, AME and IDP. The history of these breast tumours alone does not suggest possible CNC. However, if attention has been paid to the distinctive pigmentation of the anterior chest and cardiac myxoma, even a breast surgeon may have been able to consider any genetic disease. The possibility of a genetic disorder should be considered, even if it is unlikely to be positive.\n\n【16】Regarding breast surveillance in diagnosed CNC cases, more intensive follow-up with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with mammography and ultrasonography may be recommended for preservation and early detection of similar cases, following the hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. Moreover, a family history of carcinoma, particularly of the thyroid, colon, pancreas and ovaries and other multiple benign or malignant tumours, is a finding suggestive or possibly associated with CNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; therefore, for surveillance of organs for carcinogenesis, other than the breast, we should particularly focus on these organs.\n\n【17】In conclusion, multiple breast tumours can develop bilaterally in CNC, including breast cancer, even if breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenoma do not exist. Biopsy of breast lesions may be postponed or breast lesions may be left untreated even if they are pathologically diagnosed; however, a malignant breast tumour can coexist, as in this case. Therefore, actively scrutinizing breast lesions is important. Further studies investigating the relationship between CNC and breast tumours, including breast cancer, are warranted.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors’ conflicts of interest are not related to this work.

Difficult facial mask ventilation, inability to insert a laryngeal mask airway and difficult endotracheal intubation are possible complications, predicting a difficult airway situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present a case of an adult with knife injury in the posterior spine, in close relationship with vital structures needing surgical care.\n\n【5】To prevent further neurological damage, supine position was not suitable which led to difficulties to airway management. To get around this difficulty, we used a fiberoptic intubation through supraglottic device I-gel® in prone position, under general anesthesia, to secure the airway.\n\n【6】Permission was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 28-year-old man, ASA physical status II, victim of knife trauma, was brought by the pre-hospital emergency, immobilized in prone position, still with the knife in his back.\n\n【9】In the emergency room, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13 (after opioid administration), eupneic with FiO2 35%, without clinical signs of respiratory distress, tachycardic and hypertensive. Neurologically, he presented decreased sensitivity of the lower limbs and was unable to move the right lower limb. Examination of the dorsal region revealed a knife deep inserted, in the center of the spine, bellow the shoulder blades , multiple stabs at thoracodorsal level and right flank. Were administered 3L of crystalloid and 1 g of tranexamic acid.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Patient in prone position with dorsal stab wound (the back tattoo was hidden to maintain patient anonymity).</u>\n\n【11】As the risk for knife movement was real, with consequent worsening of injuries, whenever it was necessary, transfers of the patient were made in a precise and coordinated way, with the help of sheets.\n\n【12】A thoracoabdominal pelvic CT-scan, made in prone position, revealed a small pleural effusion on the right lung without pneumothorax and no major vessels lesions. The knife could be seen crossing the posterior vertebral elements and the body of the eighth dorsal vertebra, occupying the vertebral canal, suggesting a probable incomplete spinal cord injury .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Thoracic CT-scan and X-ray showing knife crossing the posterior vertebral elements and the body of the eighth dorsal vertebra.</u>\n\n【14】After multidisciplinary evaluation it was decided to remove the knife by surgical exploration, under general anesthesia, followed by exploratory laparoscopy. Because of possible dislodgment of the knife with life-threatening complications, supine and lateral decubitus positions were not considered for airway management.\n\n【15】It was outlined alternative plans for airway management. We planned to intubate the patient in prone position with C-mac® videolaryngoscope, with the head slightly rotated, as first attempt. Plan B was to insert an I-gel®supraglottic device to assure ventilation and then fiberoptic intubation through the device. Plan C was to intubate the patient in lateral position and plan D would be surgical airway.\n\n【16】The patient was monitored according to ASA Standards and preoxygenated with FiO2100% for 3 min. Rapid sequence induction was performed with Propofol 2 mg/kg and Rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg.\n\n【17】We started using a C-mac© videolaryngoscope in the prone position, with the head turned to the right. The glottis view through the C-MAC screen was a Comarck Lehane 2B, but the first intubation attempt was not successful, due to the difficulty in directing the tube. During this attempt, there was significant desaturation (SatO2 70%) with hemodynamic repercussions. Ventilation using a 4-hand face mask with oropharyngeal tube proved to be ineffective and for that we pass to plan B. An I-gel® supraglottic device number 5 was inserted with effective ventilation and oxygenation. Fiberoptic intubation through the I-gel® was attempted and the intubation of the trachea with 7-mm cuffed orotracheal tube was confirmed by capnography. During airway management the knife was not dislodged.\n\n【18】After surgery, the patient was admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) intubated and ventilated with vasopressor support. At ICU admission, with the patient already in the supine position, the supraglottic device was removed without complications by an anesthesiologist, holding the supraglottic airway device, after confirming the difficult airway car was present. The patient was extubated after 48 h, without complications.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】In a patient with normal neurological examination direct removal of the knife can be a safe option, but in the suspicion of neurological lesions surgical exploration is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This patient had neurological deficits, compatible with damage to the spinal cord with sparing of the right corticospinal tract. Therefore, in order not to cause secondary spinal cord injury, after multidisciplinary evaluation it was decided to remove the knife by surgical exploration, under general anesthesia.\n\n【21】In addition, the patient had multiple stabs at the thoracodorsal level and right flank and although the CT-scan did not report a major vessel lesion, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed afterwards. This decision was taken because the digital exploration showed that there was a violation of the peritoneum. According to the literature, the peritoneum violation is an indication for exploratory laparotomy/laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In this case, supine position was not suitable due to prevent further neurological damage. Airway approach in prone position, despite being a predictable difficult airway, might be reserved for extreme emergency situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】There are several approaches described for airway management in prone position, including fiberoptic intubation in awake patient, direct laryngoscopy (with head upside down or turned to one side), videolaryngoscopy and through laryngeal mask Fastrach® 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Fiberoptic intubation in awake patient is considered one of the best options when facing a difficult airway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. However, it demands extensive training in handling the fiberscope, especially in prone position, beyond patient’s collaboration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, it was not possible, since the patient was uncooperative, with periods of psychomotor agitation.\n\n【25】The Cochrane Systematic Review demonstrated that the use of C-mac® videolaryngoscopy instead of direct laryngoscopy, especially in difficult airway situations, improves glottis visualization and can reduce the number of failed intubations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the videolaryngoscope with extra-curved blade allows for a better view of the glottis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In this particular case of prone position, without other difficult airway stigmas, we decided to use the C-mac® videolaryngoscope with D-Blade in the first attempt of orotracheal intubation, after rapid sequence induction. Difficulties in videolaryngoscope maneuvering, together with patient desaturation, led to the failure of this technique.\n\n【27】The use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in airway rescue has been successfully used in patients in the prone position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】A recent study by van Dijck _et al._ demonstrated that the insertion of an LMA in the prone position is quick due to cuff’s absence, successful in most patients and may be considered in emergency situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. They also investigated if an I-gel® can function as a conduit for blind orotracheal intubation in the prone position but demonstrated that this was unlikely to succeed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Other study compared fiberoptic intubation through the I-gel® and Fastrach® supraglottic airway devices in supine position and demonstrated that had similar success rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, the I-gel® allowed a better visualization of the vocal cords, leading to a shorter intubation time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Taking this into account, the I-gel® is an easy, fast and effective option to maintain ventilation and oxygenation in patients in prone position. Furthermore, when patient is in supine position it seems to be a good conduit for fiberoptic intubation, minimizing the risk of esophageal intubation and glottic trauma.\n\n【31】As expected, fiberoptic intubation through a supraglottic airway device was successful. Nevertheless, in the event of some intercurrence, like bloody airway, the use of fiberscope would be limited due to the lack of good airway visualization.\n\n【32】If that would be the case, we had the plan C and D as a rescue plan, since securing the airway is a priority.\n\n【33】To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature showing fiberoptic intubation through an I-gel® supraglottic device, in prone position, as a valid choice when other approaches are not an option.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【35】None of the authors have conflicts of Interest regarding this paper.\n\n【36】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【37】Nothing to declare.\n\n【38】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【39】Nothing to declare.\n\n【40】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【41】Patient written consent was obtained and Declaration of Helsinki was respected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

AVMs clinical expression ranges from complete asymptomatic, and thus incidentally found, to life threatening with rupturing and bleeding. In this wide spectrum, osteolysis is considered as a rare complication of interosseous AVMs, and only few cases of mandible and maxilla osteolysis have been reported. We present, herein, a case of an intracranial AVM, which has caused in the course of the time an osteolysis of the dens and axis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Brain arterial malformation (AVM) belongs to cerebral vascular diseases and constitutes an abnormal direct connection between arterial and venous system in absence of an intervening capillary network. Due to this defected structure, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are prone to rupture, causing intracranial hemorrhage. Its clinical course can widely vary from asymptomatic, and thus only incidentally diagnosed, to life-threatening conditions. Within this wide spectrum, an AVM may present with headache, seizures and long-term disability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The gold standard to diagnose an AVM is through angiography, but thanks to the recent development in noninvasive imaging techniques, the incidence of asymptomatic AVMs has consecutively increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Noncontrast CT of the cervical spine reveals the unstable odontoid fracture at the basis of dens.

Interosseous AVMs themselves constitute a very rare condition mostly present in the craniofacial region with primary involvement of the mandible and maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 52-year-old woman presented in our neurosurgical emergency ward with severe headache accompanied by nonspecific radiating neck pain. The headache persisted for 3 days, and due to an exacerbation, the patient was admitted to the hospital.\n\n【10】Medical history revealed that the patient fell in the last few weeks due to a known right-sided hemiplegia. The physical examination did not show any sign of external injury like abrasions, hematomas, etc. The neurological physical examination showed an oriented but aphasic patient with a preexisting high-grade right-sided hemiparesis (3/5). The aforementioned hemiparesis resulted from an earlier (around 1976) hemorrhage of an AVM on the left hemisphere with accompanied intraventricular bleeding. The pupils were equal in size, reactive to light, and there was no relative afferent pupil defect. Moreover, an exophthalmus of the left eye was revealed as well as a known strabismus divergens and a facial nerve paresis on the right side. Furthermore, signs of meningeal irritation in form of a stiff and painful neck were detected. A brain computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted to investigate any intracranial pathology responsible for the headache symptoms as well as the hemiparesis. The results of the CT imaging were similar to those of 10 years ago, detecting no pathological findings. Thus, we proceeded with a cervical spine CT scan due to the accompanied cervical symptoms. The latter revealed an unstable fracture through the base of the dens, type II based on the Anderson and d’Alonzo classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There was no evidence of a spinal hematoma. Moreover, an extended osteolysis was revealed with reactive sclerosis of denses and axis’ endplate and margins, as shown in Figs 1 and 2 _._ The dens fracture was evaluated as a pathologic fracture. The fall incident could not explain the expanded osteolysis. Our assumption, based on the conducted imaging processes, is that the fracture was caused by a large AVM, which extended from the right side of the axis till the basis of the dens. The AVM also spread into the surrounding soft tissue.\n\n【11】During the hospitalization period, the neurological status of the patient remained unchanged, with persistent mobility difficulties. Taking into consideration the giant craniocervical AVM, the osteolysis of dens coupled with the decreased general condition of the patient, as well as her wish to avoid any kind of treatment, a conservative approach was chosen. The conservative treatment involved the adjustment of analgesics, a stiff neck collar for at least 6 weeks and regular application of physiotherapy.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Here, we publish a rare case of an osteolytic lesion caused by a giant AVM. Up to date, only a few case reports exist, describing a comparable condition. Our assumption is that the giant AVM gradually infiltrated the adjacent vertebral body causing osteolytic lesions over years. This assumption is based on the fact that the osteolysis was a previously unknown radiological finding of a known AVM and that the fall incident could not explain this finding. Due to the patient’s rejection of further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, an angiographic or histological confirmation of our assumption was not possible. For the same reason it was impossible to clarify the precise localization of the AVM. The lack of a comprehensive diagnostic control in order to exclude other types of osteolytic lesions, such as tumors, sets a limiting condition. Angiography remains the gold standard of depicting an AVM and cannot be replaced by the advanced imaging technique of CT.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the valuable contribution of all the clinical colleagues who contributed to the fulfillment of this work.

Though her neuroimaging findings were atypical to those commonly found in CM, she was diagnosed with CM with a cryptococcal antigen test. However, in contrast to the good prognosis as stated in the literature, she died during her course stay at the hospital. Therefore, cryptococcosis should be taken as differentials, even in an immunocompetent individual presenting with features suggestive of meningitis, to prevent the worst clinical outcome.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a brain infection caused by the fungus Cryptococcus (either _Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii_ ). It is one of the most typical causes of meningitis in immunocompromised people, particularly those with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although antiretroviral drugs reduce the prevalence of CM in HIV patients, the trend in an immunocompetent host is assumed to rise over the years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Annually, there are 223 100 cases of CM worldwide with the largest burden in sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asian regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Common meningeal symptoms, such as headache and neck stiffness, are usually present in classic CM. However, other systemic signs of disseminated illness, such as pneumonia and dermatological symptoms, may also be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, evaluation of immunocompetent patients with subacute to chronic meningitis for _C. neoformans_ is needed. Even though serum cryptococcal antigen and radiographic imaging help identify CM, lumbar puncture is necessary for a conclusive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. The lumbar puncture with elevated opening pressure, predominantly mononuclear cells, demonstration of encapsulated yeast with India ink and positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture of the organism are typical findings confirming the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The examination for CM is infrequently performed in low-income countries like Nepal among immunocompetent individuals who exhibit meningitis-like symptoms since the diagnosis is frequently overlooked. Unfortunately, such an immunocompetent patient with CM carries a higher mortality rate than those with an immunosuppressed state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We present a case of a 29-year-old immunocompetent female who experienced chronic blurred vision, headaches and vomiting for 3 months before being diagnosed with CM.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-year-old married female presented to our center with complaints of intermittent headaches followed by vomiting for the last 3 months. Each episode of headache was acute in onset, located in the parieto-occipital region, moderate in intensity and associated with vomiting most of the time. The pain was slightly relieved with analgesics from the local pharmacy. But, for the last 20 days, the patient reported an increase in the frequency and severity of headaches and multiple vomiting episodes. She also had a fever but the temperature was not recorded. There was no history of trauma, chronic intake of medications, loss of consciousness, abnormal body movements and recent change in behaviors. There was no significant medical or surgical history suggestive of immunodeficiency. She was a reformed smoker and occasionally consumed alcohol.\n\n【8】At presentation, the patient was conscious and well oriented to time, place and person with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 out of 15. The sensory, motor, cranial nerve and cerebellar examination did not reveal any abnormal findings. The meningeal signs like neck stiffness and Kernig’s sign were absent. Direct ophthalmoscopic examination showed no evidence of optic disk swelling or papilledema. Vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure: 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute and temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) except for tachycardia (110 bpm). The systemic examination was unremarkable. Baseline investigations were within the reference range. The serum glucose measured was 90 mg/dl. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.\n\n【9】The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ring-like lesion in the left lentiform nucleus with an eccentric nodule and surrounding edema. These features were suggestive of neurocysticercosis (colloidal vesicular stage). Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done on the next day which revealed normal white cell count (less than five cells), high protein (50 mg/dl; 15–45 mg/dl), low glucose (30 mg/dl; 50–80 mg/dl) and normal adenosine deaminase (8 U/L; < 10 U/L) levels. The opening pressure was 12 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O. Gram staining showed multiple budding yeast cells resembling _Cryptococcus_ sp. Likewise, India ink preparation of the CSF sample showed a capsule structure resembling _C. neoformans_ . The diagnosis of CM was made a week after the admission. A part of the sample was sent outside for a cryptococcal antigen test as it was not available in our center.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MRI of head. ( **a** ) T2-weighted view. ( **b** ) FLAIR view. Red arrows showing ring-like lesion in the left lentiform nucleus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|India ink staining of CSF showing _C. neoformans._</u>\n\n【12】The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), and central venous and arterial access was obtained. Parenteral amphotericin B (liposomal; 3 mg/kg/day) was started for CM. Likewise, oral fluconazole (800 mg per day) was also administered as flucytosine was not available in our setting. Therapeutic CSF drainage was planned in case of persistent headache and/or vomiting. Other supportive treatment measures including chest physiotherapy and mobilization were provided. The following day of ICU admission, she developed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, which was managed conservatively. She developed hypotension (90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (112 bpm) and tachypnea (26 breaths per minute). The serum lactate level was elevated (4.5 mmol/L), and the diagnosis of septic shock was made. Noradrenaline (10 mcg/min) was started for the same. Parenteral meropenem (1 g every 8 h) was added for worsening oxygenation with the differential diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50–55%, severe tricuspid regurgitation with estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg and severely dilated right cardiac chambers. Therefore, furosemide (80 mg IV) was administered for volume overload.\n\n【13】In the meantime, the antigen test for _Cryptococcus_ came back positive. The septic shock resolved gradually, and the noradrenaline infusion was stopped. Therapeutic lumbar puncture was done for 2 days and 23 mL of CSF was removed as the opening pressure was high (>35 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O; 10–20 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O). The rest of the intensive care and monitoring was continued. But, after 2 days of slight improvement (clinically), the condition of the patient suddenly deteriorated, and ultimately, she passed away on the 7th day of her ICU stay. The actual cause of the death could not be determined as the postmortem examination was not conducted.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】In contrast to Cryptococcosis that is considered a classical disease with certain underlying diseases pathology or predisposing factors, cryptococcosis in phenotypically normal individuals is on the rise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The global burden of CM in the immunocompromised population, particularly in the HIV-AIDS population, has been extended with an estimated prevalence of 6.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A comprehensive report from 2015 estimates the total burden of CM (in HIV/AIDS and immunocompromised patients) to be 164 (0.6 per 100 000) in Nepal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The occurrence of CM in immunocompetent individuals (non-HIV and non-transplant patients) has been increasing steadily with most centers reporting up to 20% of cases in the non-immunocompromised population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. According to a study by Hevey _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the 90-day mortality was higher in immunocompetent groups (41.1%) as compared with immunocompromised groups (15.2% in HIV and 12.2% in transplant groups).\n\n【16】Two fungi are implicated in invasive cryptococcosis, _C. neoformans_ and _C. gatti_ , both encapsulated yeasts. However, _C. neoformans_ has been associated with the immunocompromised host in contrast to _C. gatti_ , which is shown to occur with immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Cryptococcus species have a propensity for the central nervous system, particularly in immunocompromised patients, because of their multiple virulence factors. However, CM in immunocompetent patients is difficult to explain. The possible explanations could be because of exposure to cryptococcal strain with high pathogenicity, high level of pathogen exposure, or subtle or undetectable immune deficits. Such deficits could be because of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus or autoimmune conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our case did not have any of those subtle causes for immune deficits, because of which we labeled our case as apparently immunocompetent.\n\n【17】The Cryptococcus species, in immunocompetent individuals, have more propensity for developing pulmonary cryptococcosis than in immunocompromised individuals. Similarly, the neuroimaging findings are more localized and include hydrocephalus in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. The clinical picture of CM in immunocompetent patients tends to have typical features including fever, stiff neck, headache, vomiting or altered mental status in contrast to immunocompromised individuals, who have only subtle clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Regarding our case, she had neurological involvement with fever and vomiting as the initial presentation and later neurological deterioration. The neuroimaging findings did not show hydrocephalus, instead had a ring-enhancing lesion resembling findings of the colloidal vesicular stage of neurocysticercosis. However, there can be findings in imaging like cerebral infarction, granulomas and pseudocysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As for Nepal, in two case reports of CM in immunocompetent patients, both had apparently immunocompetent patients without any subtle immune deficits. And with the appropriate treatment as per recommended guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>, both had good prognoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. However, it was quite the opposite regarding our patient, who died during the course of treatment in the ICU of our center. This could be possibly because of neurological deterioration secondary to raised intracranial pressure. There is conflicting evidence on the prognosis of CM in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with some favoring immunocompetent individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. However, mortality can also be pertinent in immunocompetent individuals because of the unavailability of investigative tools, frequent overlooking of the diagnosis and delayed presentation.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】Hence, cryptococcosis should be considered despite an apparent immunocompetent individual without any known comorbid conditions presenting with features suggestive of meningitis. The early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of CM could lead to a better neurological outcome and prognosis for the patient.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the case study.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bishal Dhakal, Nepalese Army Institute of Health and Sciences, 44 600, Kathmandu, Nepal.

The authors report a genotype 1b HCV-positive patient with chronic hepatitis who exhibited lesions involving both hepatic lobes resembling hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy revealed an MZL of the liver. Antiviral treatment using sofosbuvir associated with simeprevir as unique treatment was started and resulted in complete haematological response.

In low-grade B-NHLs and, in particular MZLs, the favorable impact of antiviral therapy has been discussed in several clinical studies, although eradication of HCV infection was not always associated with B-NHL remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. On the contrary, in high-grade, HCV-related B-NHLs manifesting as DLBCLs, the first-line treatment is chemotherapy. We describe a unique case of HCV-related primary MZL of the liver with complete remission of lymphoma after antiviral treatment.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) Lava flex T1-weighted NMR after infusion of Gadobutrol 1.0 mmol/ml showing two lesions in liver segment VI; (B) lava flex T1-weighted NMR after infusion of Gadobutrol 1.0 mmol/ml showing a lesion in liver segment I III; (C) lava flex T1-weighted NMR after infusion of Gadobutrol 1.0 mmol/ml showing disappearance of the two lesions in liver segment VI; (D) lava flex T1-weighted NMR after infusion of Gadobutrol 1.0 mmol/ml showing disappearance of the lesion in liver segment III.</u>\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】Ultrasonographic examination of an asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection revealed a hypoechogenic lesion in liver segment III. Active chronic liver disease was diagnosed 12 years previously based on liver biopsy that revealed a grade of 8 and stage 3 according to the Ishak staging system. Results of laboratory investigations were as follows: HCV RNA, 2530000 IU/ml; normal lactate dehydrogenase level (270 U/l \\[normal, 240–450 U/l\\]); haemoglobin, 12.9 g/dl; platelet count, 175.000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; white blood cell count, 4900/mm <sup>2 </sup> ; aspartate aminotransferase, 40 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 65 U/l; albumin, 4.1 g/dl and total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dl. Total body computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast revealed several nodular liver lesions with early arterial phase enhancement and slow washout with uncertain diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated hyperintensity on post-contrast T1-weighted images of the lesions and isointensity in the T2 phase . Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated only intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in different areas of the liver as a unique localization of the neoplasm. A liver biopsy was prompted by the uncertain behavior of the liver lesions. Microscopic examination of the liver biopsy revealed infiltration of typical centrocyte-like lymphoid cells and lymphoepithelial lesions in these small- to medium-size lymphocytes . Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for CD20, CD79a and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD43 and cyclin D1 . A diagnosis of stage IV liver MZL was made. Bone marrow biopsy did not reveal infiltration of lymphocytes. After haematology consultation, it was decided to administer antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir (NS5B inhibitor) associated with simeprevir (a protease inhibitor) for a duration of 12 weeks. Three months after the conclusion of antiviral treatment, HCV RNA was negative, thus confirming the eradication of HCV infection. MRI performed 6 and 12 months after antiviral therapy demonstrated complete resolution of the liver lesions . Currently, no liver lesions are apparent on MRI after 3 years of follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|(A) An infiltration of small round to cleaved lymphocytes with germinal centers in the specimen; hematoxylin and eosin × 100, (B) hematoxylin and eosin × 400; (C) staining with immunohistochemical and expression of bcl-2 (×200); (D) staining with immunohistochemical and expression of CD20 (original magnification × 200).</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】We report a case of primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) due to HCV-related MZL. The phrase ‘primary liver lymphoma’ should be applied only to cases in which no other localization of NHLs is demonstrated; nevertheless, this entity remains controversial to some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, we did not find other sources of MZLs, given that PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy were negative for lymphoma localization at other sites. Although the World Health Organization classification system for lymphoma types does not report the classification ‘primary liver lymphoma’ in our case, we did not find other sources of MZLs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The link between infectious agents and the development of MZLs has long been recognized, and the association between HCV and B-NHL has been firmly established in epidemiological studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the most convincing evidence supporting a causal relationship between HCV infection and MZLs in particular was the phenomenon of lymphoma regression after HCV eradication regardless of the antiviral treatment administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. It has been demonstrated that the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 can interact with a specific B cell receptor associated with the CD19/CD21/CD81 complex. This interaction lowers the threshold for B cell activation and induces the proliferation of benign B cells. However, prolonged exposure to stimuli may render B cells to be at risk for additional events leading to malignant transformation. Antiviral treatment to eradicate HCV infection appears to halt these mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. In the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, version 1.2019, and, according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, combined therapy with direct-acting antivirals should be considered in asymptomatic patients with HCV infection because it can result in regression of lymphoma in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】PHL is a very rare malignancy and accounts for only ~0.016% of all cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and, among PHLs, a primary low-grade lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, only one case of HCV-related MZL in the liver has been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the case described here, the Authors did not attempt to confirm that the liver lymphoma was primary and baseline PET-CT was not performed. Furthermore, antiviral treatment was not effective in inducing regression of the hepatic lesions. We believe that the term ‘PHL’ must be considered in future B-NHL classifications.\n\n【12】In our case, the liver lesions appeared hypointense on T1-weighted images and isointense on T2-weighted images. After contrast administration, the lesions appeared hyperintense in the arterial phase without a clear washout in the portal and late venous phase. This behavior rendered the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma uncertain. For these reasons, liver biopsy of the hepatic lesions was performed to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma from other causes of liver masses.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we describe the first case of HCV-related MZLs isolated to the liver. This is a unique entity and should be suspected in HCV-infected patients exhibiting liver lesions with uncertain behavior without other demonstrable lymphoma localization. In our case, first treating the HCV infection appeared to be effective in determining a complete haematological response, and HCV treatment should be considered as first-line therapy. Chemotherapy must be reserved only for patients who do not respond to antiviral therapy.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest are declared by the Authors.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Adriano Pellicelli.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Organophosphates are commonly used in households worldwide and are a common cause of childhood poisonings. This case report describes an unintentional ingestion of a child in East Africa. A thorough patient history and a high index of suspicion are needed in recognizing an organophosphate poisoning. Prompt patient stabilization and treatment improve outcomes. Neurologic sequela may occur and thus patient follow-up is recommended.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Unintentional ingestions are common worldwide in children and adults. Most cases in children are unintentional and are due to the ingestion of a liquid. Organophosphate insecticides are readily available worldwide and cause irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the blood and nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The body is unable to break down acetylcholine without acetylcholinesterase causing an accumulation which results in a cholinergic toxidrome. These symptoms are similar in children and adults and can appear 3 to 12 h after ingestion. Symptoms include bradycardia, miosis, lacrimation, salivation and bronchospasm.\n\n【4】Bronchoconstriction and central nervous system depression cause respiratory failure and severe poisonings may lead to myocardial ischemia. Long-term sequelae such as neuropathy and neurobehavioral deficits can occur weeks after ingestion. For this reason, follow-up is recommended.\n\n【5】Although data are sparse, it is known that organophosphate poisonings are a frequent cause of emergency admissions to hospital in developing countries, especially in South-East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

The ingestion occurred 2–3 h prior to arrival to the hospital. The unlabeled ingested powder used as a pesticide was brought to the health facility by the family.\n\n【8】CLINICAL FINDINGS\n-----------------\n\n【9】The child’s vital signs upon arrival were a heart rate of 130 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20b/m and random blood sugar 442 mg/dl, with an illegible pulse oximeter. He weighed 9.6 kg.\n\n【10】THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION\n------------------------\n\n【11】Emergency treatment included 150 ml Ringer’s Lactate bolus, cimetidine 400 mg IV and atropine 1 mg IV. Cardiorespiratory arrest ensued, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation and respiration after 4 min. A gastric lavage was attempted, but quickly halted due to concerns of aspiration.\n\n【12】Stabilization continued with atropine 0.02 mg/kg (0.2 mg) every 10–20 min for a total of 1 mg, due to ongoing signs of organophosphate poisoning including miosis, increased secretions and a brief self-terminating seizure.\n\n【13】Within 24 h the child had returned to his normal cognition and was off oxygen. He was discharged home the next day. Attempts to contact the child’s family for follow-up were not successful and the mission closed some 6–8 weeks later.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Ingestions are common in children. Successful recovery from organophosphate poisoning is based on time from ingestion to initial presentation, rapid stabilization and definitive treatment with atropine.\n\n【16】Recommended atropine dosing is 0.02–0.05 mg/kg repeated every 5–10 min until symptoms resolve. In this case atropine was administered gradually, every 15–20 min, out of concern for adverse reactions with good resolution of signs and symptoms.\n\n【17】Prophylactic diazepam has been suggested in the literature to decrease neurocognitive dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although diazepam was not administered to our patient (since the seizure was self-resolving), no immediate neurological concerns were observed. Lessons learned from this case include the importance of prompt identification of the ingested substance, and the need for follow-up to assess for long-term neurological deficits. The unlabeled powder in this case was identified as an organophosphate due to prior similar cases in this health facility and the child’s initial presentation (especially increased oral secretions).\n\n【18】Gastric lavages are not recommended as they can cause aspiration.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】In face of typical symptoms such as those described for our patient, there should be a high suspicion of organophosphate exposure even when the patient or his/her family is not aware of it. Although not used in this case diazepam administration can be considered to decrease complications. Understanding proper management of ingestion cases is essential for the successful treatment of poisonings, notably in children.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Claire Kilbride MD (ER physician on Mission).</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nadia Lafferty MD.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Marta A Balinska, PhD MPH (medical writing services).</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was funded entirely by MSF.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A 62-year-old male physician presented to emergency room with chest discomfort followed by thought to be normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and normal echocardiography results. His serial hs-troponin test showed remarkable escalation three hours from the initial (107 ng/l into 4.978 ng/l), suggesting a high-risk non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). An early invasive procedure was performed, showing acute total occlusion (TO) in the obtuse marginal 1 branch. We retrospectively reviewed our examination to diagnose better the presence of TO in NSTEMI patients presented with non-diagnostic examination. Our evaluation showed a minor change in the form of an ‘N-wave’ pattern on the ECG, which was not yet an established guideline criterion for prompt angiography. Although ECG pattern is often normal in LCx occlusion, recent study shows the presence of ‘N-wave’ ECG pattern in 10% of NSTEMI cases following TO at LCx.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential diagnostic tool in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as its availability and usability in determining the involvement of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). Unfortunately, over 25.5% of total occlusions (TO) present without classic ST-T changes on the surface ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–4 \\]</u>. These subgroups of patients are identified as STEMI-equivalent, one of whom was characterized by the presence of an N-wave. N-waves are present in 10% of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients and associated with an equivalent risk with STEMI patients. The recognition of N-waves can be helpful to determine urgent revascularization. The study conducted by Meyers _et al_ . stated that ECG findings other than ST-elevation criteria could identify TO sooner and more accurately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 62-year-old male physician presented to the emergency room with a 2-hour history of migratory discomfort involving epigastric, back and central chest. The pain was episodic, non-radiating and migrated from place to place. He initially had a one-month history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption due to toothache. He used self-prescribed intravenous anti-dyspepsia, anti-spasmodic, sublingual nitrates and even a Fentanyl patch to relieve his symptoms. The treatment obscured the major complaint, with a 7/10 score on the pain scale. As he seemed anxious, 2 mg of morphine was given to relieve symptoms.\n\n【6】The patient was alert and had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and previous chest pain. His physical examination was within the normal limits, with blood pressure 130/84 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, oxygen saturation 94% (room air) and respiratory rate 20 per minute.\n\n【7】ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm without signs of ischemia . Blood samples showed an increase in troponin (107 ng/l), which drove suspicion of ACS. Further cardiac examination was planned with the re-evaluation of possible ECG changes, 3-hour cardiac troponin (cTn) samples and echocardiogram.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|electrocardiogram performed during examination in ED.

The echocardiogram  showed normal cardiac chambers with no regional wall motion abnormalities.\n\n【12】Clinical, ECG and echocardiography examinations weren’t diagnostic for Myocardial Infarction (MI) as HEART score classified him as low risk (Risk of MACE 0.9–1.7%). However, there was a remarkable escalation of repeated hs-Troponin (4978 ng/l), which is associated with high-risk NSTEMI. According to our laboratory protocol, the repeated hs-Troponin measurement was performed within 3-hour intervals. Due to the pronounced hs-troponin spike, widespread, ongoing ischemia was suspected, and an immediate invasive strategy was preferred.\n\n【13】An initial 300 mg aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor were given. Inpatient diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG) was carried out via femoral approach , revealing multiple stenoses and ectasis. Driven by high hs-troponin following an atypical presentation of ACS, careful observation of the CAG resulted in recognizing an osteal TO of the obtuse marginal 1 (OM1) branch. A late contrast-filled vessel at the anterolateral region of the myocardiogram  was believed to be a hidden culprit lesion.\n\n【14】Due to the tortuosity, a Hi-Torque Versaturn Abbott Guiding Wire was used unsuccessfully . Next, a GW Fielder XT was used and managed to enter the total lost OM1 branch . Further procedures were routine, with predilatation balloon and implantation of a sirolimus-eluting stent at the proximal LCx to the OM1 branch . An immediate invasive strategy was performed with an established TIMI-3 flow through IRA, and the symptoms were immediately resolved after the procedure .\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】We present a case of patient with migratory discomfort and history of initial self-prescribed drugs, which probably masked unstable angina and clinical presentation. Routine evaluations of ACS were performed, which showed thought to be normal serial ECG, normal echocardiography findings and the spike in high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). Driven solely by the astounding elevation of hs-cTn, CAG was carried out and showed TO of OM1 branch. An immediate invasive strategy was performed with good results.\n\n【17】The presence of TO showed a gap between ECG pattern and spike of the hs-cTn result. The possible reason is due to the LCx occlusion, which is known as the ‘blind area’. Around 30% of patients with LCx occlusion might show a non-diagnostic ECG since the standard 12-leads are not applied facing the inferolateral wall, mainly supplying the basal part of the left ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. There has been a shift in the literature toward finding ECG patterns highly suggestive of TO. Niu _et al_ . were the first to report the presence of the so-called ‘N-wave’ and the involvement of the QRS complex in LCx occlusion. N-waves is defined as (i) a notch or deflection in the terminal QRS complex on the surface ECG; (ii) the height of the notch or deflection of _\\>_ 2 mm; (iii) a continuous change of the notch in 24 hours, even disappearance or transition into the s wave and (iv) prolongation of QRS duration in these leads marks the delayed activation of the ischemic zone. The presence of N-wave in the lead II, III, AVF is associated with 77% sensitivity and 89% specificity of LCx lession, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Right after the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) procedure, a comprehensive re-assessment was made. We realized the decision to perform an immediate invasive strategy was based on vague symptoms, ‘normal ECG’ and spike Delta/changes hs-Troponin with an interval of 3 hours. However, after noticing the inferior leads N-wave , we believe it could have shortened the ischemic time by much faster decision and investigation focusing on the LCx. It is estimated that 27% of NSTEMI patients have an occluded infarct artery, more frequently found in an artery supplying the inferolateral wall. The simple bedside N-wave pattern could be an additional diagnostic tool to unmask the TO, which certainly needs prompt reperfusion (STEMI-Equivalent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|an electrocardiogram showing the so-called ‘N-wave’ in the inferior leads is consistent with left circumflex occlusion (OM1 branch). Noted the presence of N-waves in the initial ECG ( **A** ) and repeated ECG ( **B** ). The presence of N-waves in our cases is consisted of (i) a notch or deflection in the terminal QRS complex on the surface ECG (black arrows in the inferior lead); (ii) the height of the notch or deflection of 3 mm (oval box) and (iii) prolongation of QRS duration in inferior leads (black lines)</u>\n\n【20】The diagnostic work-up in our patient was driven by a surge in hs-troponin since serial ECG and echocardiogram were non-diagnostic for AMI. A re-evaluation of ECG after immediate invasive strategy showed the presence of N-wave and delayed activation of QRS complex, which is consistent with LCx occlusion. We found a pitfall in recognizing this pattern as it hasn’t been listed in recent guidelines. A thorough evaluation of STEMI-equivalent pattern ECG might be helpful for a clinician in determining the revascularization timing.\n\n【21】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【22】Not applicable.\n\n【23】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【24】M.Y.A.

Postoperatively, the elbow was immobilized in a 90° flexion back splint for 2 weeks. After that, a progressive flexion extension of the elbow was started, which was guided by the physiotherapist. After 6 months, the patient had regained satisfactory motion with no pain.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|3D reconstructed computed tomography of the elbow revealed a comminuted fracture of the capitellum with displaced separate trochlea.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Postoperative radiography showed fixation of the fractures using two Herbert screws with tension band wire fixation of the olecranon.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Trochlear fractures have been rarely reported in the literature, the reason for which they have no clear classification. However, capitellar fractures have many classifications despite their rarity. Bryan and Morrey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> proposed a classification based on three types of capitellar fracture: Type 1 (Hahn–Steinthal) involves the capitellum with an attached subchondral bone; Type 2 (Kocher–Lorenz) involves only the cartilaginous articular surface of the capitellum; Type 3 (Broberg–Morrey) corresponds to a comminuted fracture of the capitellum; and Type 4 added by McKee _et al_ . which includes both the capitellum and a part of the trochlea in one fragment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】On the other hand, the classification of Dubberley _et al._  is comprehensive and allows the inclusion of all varieties of these fractures. It is the only one that indicates the surgical approach based on the fracture type; it takes into account the fracture of both capitellum and trochlea as separate fragments: the Type I fracture include capitellar fracture with or without a part of the lateral trochlear ridge; Type II fracture involves the capitellum and trochlea as one fragment. Type III fracture involves the capitellum and trochlea as two independent fragments. Each type is subdivided to B or A depending on the presence or absence of the posterior condylar comminution, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. According to this last classification, our case belongs to the type III fracture. However, its subdivided entities do not take into consideration the comminution or not of the capitellar fracture. We propose to subdivide the Types III A and III B into subtypes 0 and 1 depending on the absence or presence of comminution of the capitellum, respectively . Thus, our case will be classified exactly as a Type III-A1 fracture according to the Dubberley’s classification.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification.</u>\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification modified\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n【18】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification modified\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n【22】Open in new tab\n\n【23】The exact mechanism of these injuries is still uncertain. However, isolated trochlea fractures (Laugier’s fractures) are suggested to be secondary to indirect trauma following a fall on the outstretched hand in combination with an axial load as the predominant mechanism. Isolated capitellum fractures can occur as a result of compression by the radial head with the elbow in full extension during the injury event or as a result of direct trauma to a highly flexed elbow. In our case, we suggested that the fracture was caused by a complex mechanism that included elbow extension, axial load from the coronoid process to the trochlea, varus stress and radial head compression force on the capitellum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is based on plain radiographs of the injured elbow.

MRI of brain and orbits at this time demonstrated post-radiation changes without intraocular or intracranial metastases.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Metastases should be suspected in definitively treated cancers when unexplained examination or radiological findings are observed.

The aneurysm was treated successfully. Six years later, however, she presented with a progressive _en coup de sabre_ deformity, leading to the diagnosis Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS), a rare diagnosis characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones and often associated with various non-specific intracerebral abnormalities. In this patient retrospective analysis of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging imaging indeed revealed intracerebral calcifications and aspecific white matter lesions. Remarkably, in this patient the giant intracranial aneurysm turned out to be the presenting symptom of PRS years before the characteristic facial deformities became apparent.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS) is a slowly progressive syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones. It is a heterogeneous disorder with an incompletely understood pathogenesis. Several etiologies have been proposed, including auto-immunity, vascular dysfunction, trauma, infection, autonomic dysfunction, neural crest migration disruption and a possible genetic predisposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PRS is suggested to be part of a larger disease entity, which encloses linear scleroderma en coup de sabre as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most frequent systemic manifestations of PRS are neurologic, affecting up to 20% of patients. These neurological symptoms include seizures, migraines (sometimes leading to hemiplegia), brain atrophy, cranial neuropathies, intracranial aneurysms and other intracranial vascular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>.

Except for intermittent headaches, occurring approximately once every month, there were no other clinical symptoms. Neurological examination showed no other abnormalities, including normal ophthalmoscopy.

She was referred for neurosurgery, where balloon occlusion of the aneurysm was performed successfully.\n\n【18】Postoperatively, we observed minimal right sided ptosis and slight difference in pupil size, the right pupil being smaller . The patient complained of headaches along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, which was successfully treated with carbamazepine for 6 months.\n\n【19】On routine check-ups, a progressive en coup de sabre deformity was noted on the right forehead, where originally the hemangioma was located . Retrospectively, the brain CT showed right occipital intracerebral calcifications . Furthermore, the brain MRI showed white matter lesions in the area of these intracerebral calcifications, possible vascular degenerative (developmental venous angioma) . The patient still complained of right sided migraines. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PRS was made 6 years after surgery.\n\n【20】Currently, the patient is 20 years old. Routine yearly check-ups including brain imaging show a slight progression of the hemifacial atrophy, unchanged appearance of the occluded aneurysm and no expansion of intracranial calcifications and white matter lesions . Furthermore, no additional aneurysms have been found.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】PRS is a rare syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones.

In these cases, the patients were already diagnosed with PRS years before aneurysm development. By contrast, in our patient, the initial symptom was a right abducens nerve palsy caused by an intracranial aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The diagnosis PRS was only made a few years later, when the hemifacial atrophy became more apparent. Both the hemifacial atrophy and the intradermal capillary hemangioma were located on the right forehead, but the location of the hemangioma did not fully correspond with the extent of the atrophy. Therefore, the atrophy cannot be explained by the presence of the hemangioma.\n\n【24】To our knowledge, this is the third report describing an association between PRS and intracranial aneurysms in childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.

In case of a intracranial aneurysm in PRS, these aneurysms can be multiple and progressive, therefore regular follow up is advised.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank our patient for her consent to publish the case and the related pictures.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was taken from the patient for publication of the case report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient's written consent was taken for publication.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>L.A.

In TMA presenting with severe hypertension, it is difficult to determine whether the TMA is primary and due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or secondary to severe hypertension. The response to antihypertensive medication favors the diagnosis of severe hypertension as the cause of TMA. Comorbid inflammatory disease supports the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. This case describes a 75-year-old woman with Castleman disease who presented with severe hypertension and TMA. She improved with hypertension therapy. However, ADAMST13 showed zero activity, and the diagnosis was TTP. In cases of TMA accompanied by severe hypertension, it is challenging to diagnose the cause of TMA. Even when there is a pronounced clinical response to lowering blood pressure, the diagnosis of TTP should be considered, particularly when an inflammatory disease is present.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a syndrome characterized by thrombosis in capillaries and arterioles together with a clinical presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia and target organ injury. There are many causes of TMA, but the main categories are divided into primary and secondary. Primary TMA includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, complement-mediated TMA and cobalamin deficiency. Each of these types has a specific deficiency or impairment that should be identified and corrected to resolve the TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Secondary TMA is a process secondary to underlying systemic disease. Examples of secondary TMA causes are severe hypertension, infection, malignancy and autoimmune diseases. TMA is treated by diagnosing and treating the underlying disorder. Recognizing TMA as a medical emergency, prompt identification of its specific subtype and initiation of appropriate treatment are critical to minimize organ damage and enhance survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Differentiating between TTP and severe hypertension as the cause of TMA in patients who present with hypertension, thrombocytopenia, MAHA and target organ injury is difficult. In this paper, we present such a case, review the literature for similar cases and discuss the appropriate way to manage similar patients.\n\n【5】### Case presentation\n\n【6】A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain and headache. Two years prior to her admission, she was diagnosed with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), which had remained stable. It was characterized by lymphadenopathy and mild thrombocytopenia, and no treatment had been administered during this time. In addition, her medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Upon admission, her blood pressure (BP) was 240/111 mmHg; all other vital signs were normal (N). Her blood test revealed chronic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin, 9; MCV, 66), acute thrombocytopenia \\[platelets (PLTs), 21 000/μl\\], elevated bilirubin (2.7, UNL < 1.5 mg/dl), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (600 IU/L, UNL < 220) and undetectable haptoglobin. White blood cells, creatinine and coagulation parameters were within normal range, and Coombs test was negative. An ADAMST13 activity blood test was drawn and sent to the lab. Subsequently, neurologic signs developed: right hand weakness, full blindness, with a consciousness level rapidly deteriorating to a comatose state. Fundus examination showed exudative retinal detachment without tear. Numerous schistocytes were evident on a peripheral blood film. In suspicion of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests of the brain were conducted and did not demonstrate acute findings. The combination of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, the mentioned retinal findings and neurological signs, along with excessive hypertension, led to a diagnosis of hypertensive emergency with secondary TMA. Intravenous labetalol treatment was initiated, and her BP was gradually stabilized. After several hours, she became fully alert and all neurological signs resolved but the thrombocytopenia worsened (PLT 11 000/μl). Two days later, the result of the ADAMST13 blood test returned showing zero activity. Subsequently, plasmapheresis treatment was initiated (3 treatments) with a gradual improvement of PLT count to 236 000/μl . The patient was discharged with steroid treatment and hematology follow-up. Two months later, she presented with mild thrombocytopenia (PLT 90 000/μl), and schistocytes were observed in the blood film. Rituximab treatment was added and the PLT count gradually rose to within normal range.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Change in PLT count during hospitalization relative to PLT transfusions and plasmapheresis treatment.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】TMA is a medical emergency and should be rapidly diagnosed and treated. However, diagnosing the cause of TMA can be challenging, even for experienced clinicians. A study of 254 physicians found that 47% diagnose the underlying condition of TMA after >1 week of presentation, and 13% initiate treatment beyond 1 week post presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】TTP is the most common cause of primary TMA. Impaired activity of ADAMST13, a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, causes thrombi formation in small vessels and the clinical presentation of TMA. The most common underlying etiology is IgG antibodies formed against ADAMST13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Without plasmapheresis treatment, TTP has the highest mortality rate of all etiologies of TMA (90%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation are necessary. The diagnosis of TTP is confirmed by measurement of ADAMST13 activity. However, this test is not available in every hospital, and there can be a delay of days until the clinician receives the results. Therefore, in cases highly suspicious for TTP, as well as in cases of TMA without other identifiable etiology, plasmapheresis should be initiated, even without a definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Hypertensive emergency is an umbrella term for clinical conditions characterized by excessive hypertension presenting with target organ damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. One of these conditions is hypertensive encephalopathy, a syndrome of extreme hypertension and neurological deficits such as altered mental status, visual deficits and seizures. Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure following the failure of autoregulation mechanisms of brain vessels against excessively high arterial pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is the resolution of clinical symptoms and radiological signs following BP decrease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】As both hypertension-induced TMA and TTP may have similar clinical presentations, differentiating between the two can be complex. The case presented here concerns a female patient with a background of MCD who presented with a clinical and laboratory picture of TMA. Given that her presentation included severe hypertension with notable neurological signs that dramatically resolved upon BP stabilization, TMA secondary to severe hypertension was the suspected diagnosis; however, the final diagnosis was TTP.\n\n【14】Several case reports and discussions have addressed the challenge of differentiating between hypertension and TTP-induced TMA in patients who present with excessive hypertension and clinical presentation of TMA. The consensus is that patients with TMA should be managed with empiric plasmapheresis (PFX). Nevertheless, when there is a highly suggestive precipitating factor for TMA, and there is dramatic clinical improvement upon treatment, it is reasonable to delay PFX.\n\n【15】Khanal _et al_ . reviewed the literature for cases of hypertension-induced TMA and found that they are characterized by high mean atrial pressure (160 mmHg), median PLT count of 59 000/μl and significant acute kidney injury (AKI; average creatinine, 4.14 mg/dl). The most prominent finding was that all patients showed symptomatic improvement after lowering their BP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Abdalla _et al_ . described a 63-year-old patient who presented with dyspnea, hematemesis, epistaxis, blurred vision, severe hypertension (200/106 mmHg) and unremarkable findings in fundus exam. Laboratory results revealed hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia (PLT 40 000/μl) and markedly elevated creatinine (13.5 mg/dl). Numerous schistocytes per HPF were observed in peripheral blood smear, and the ADAMTS13 activity test showed 69% activity. PFX was started immediately, and there was profound AKI that required hemodialysis. The ADAMST13 test result did not support TTP, and the final diagnosis was malignant hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Mitaka _et al_ . describe a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with excessive hypertension (240/140 mmHg), AKI (CRT 11 mg/dl), thrombocytopenia (97 000/μl) and schistocytes in blood smear. Fundoscopy revealed hypertensive retinopathy, and MRI demonstrated posterior reversible encephalopathy. As the findings were highly suggestive of hypertension-induced TMA, the patient was treated with antihypertensive agents and hemodialysis, with subsequent dramatic improvement in his PLT counts and improved kidney function. ADAMST13 activity was 61%, excluding the diagnosis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Shibagaki _et al_ . described a 33-year-old male who presented with severe hypertension (160/120 mmHg) after discontinuing his antihypertensive medication. He was found to have thrombocytopenia (69 000/μl), MAHA and severe AKI requiring hemodialysis. Fundus examination revealed significant cotton exudates in both retinas. He was treated with intravenous antihypertensive agents with clinical and laboratory improvement. PFX was not initiated, and ADAMST13 activity was normal. The authors suggested that the immediate decision should rely on PLT counts. When there is severe thrombocytopenia (PLT < 5000/μl), empiric PFX should be imitated. Otherwise, the decision should be based on the clinical situation, including the degree of hypertension and history of longstanding hypertension, which favor the diagnosis of hypertension-induced TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Based on one case, Zheng _et al_ . suggested using immature PLT increments following PFX initiation as a support for the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. However, this method requires initiation of PFX prior to the final diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】As the most common cause of TTP is antibodies against ADAMST13, a presentation of TMA in patients with a background of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases may favor the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. Given that MCD is characterized by overproduction of cytokines and immunoglobulins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, it is reasonable to assume that MCD may be associated with TTP. Indeed, there are anecdotal reports of an association between CD and TTP. Benevides _et al_ . described the first case of ADAMST13 deficiency and TTP precipitated by unicentric Castleman disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. London _et al_ . described four cases of TTP associated with MCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In summary, we described a case of a patient with MCD who presented with TMA. The initial presentation was highly suggestive of TMA secondary to severe hypertension. Despite the dramatic clinical response to hypertension treatment, ADAMST13 activity was null and the final diagnosis was TTP.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】Identifying the specific subtype of TMA rapidly and initiating the correct treatment is essential. In cases of TMA accompanied by severe hypertension, it is challenging to correctly diagnose the cause of TMA. Regardless of a dramatic clinical response to lowering BP, the diagnosis of TTP should still be considered, especially when there is a comorbid inflammatory disease.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written consent upon admission, acknowledging that their case may be used for academic purposes, including publication.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Itamar Feldman is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

On examination, no change was observed in the mucosal surface of the esophagus, but we found stricture associated with compression from the outside. Subsequently, he underwent positron emission tomography–computed tomography (CT), and multiple lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular fossa, mediastinal, intraperitoneal and right inguinal nodes, showed通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation. Because the mediastinal lymph node metastasis was pressing on his esophagus, he underwent esophageal self-expanding uncovered metal stent insertion, and his symptoms improved. A mediastinal lymph node (#7) biopsy conducted by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration revealed squamous cell carcinoma. However, a whole-body examination could not detect the primary lesion, and he was diagnosed with postoperative recurrence of CUP. Since lung cancer has more treatment options than other cancers, we considered his CUP as a subtype of lung cancer. Figure 1A details his treatment course with some events. Chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; Days 1, 8 and 15 in a 4-week cycle) and carboplatin (target area under the curve, 6; Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) was initiated as first-line treatment. Ramucirumab (10 mg/kg, Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) and docetaxel (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) were administered as second-line treatment. The patient underwent biopsy of the tumor within the esophageal stent, and the tumor was histologically determined as squamous cell carcinoma . Thereafter, the patient was initiated on third-line treatment with S-1 (100 mg/day, Days 1–28 in a 6-week cycle). After one cycle of S-1, the tumor at the lower edge of the esophageal stent grew and the patient often vomited because of obstruction. He underwent esophageal self-expanding covered metal stent insertion at the site of obstruction and could resume eating. Three weeks after stenting, he received nivolumab as fourth-line treatment. After three cycles of nivolumab, he had a high fever and productive cough with purulent sputum. A chest CT showed consolidation along the right bronchus that demonstrated pneumonia and a fistula at the truncus intermedius . He then underwent bronchoscopy, where we found three bronchoesophageal fistulae . Furthermore, we placed a third esophageal covered stent to seal the tracheoesophageal communication after the pneumonia improved. However, his left vocal cord got paralyzed due to the enlargement of the left cervical lymph node metastasis, which was found on bronchoscopy examination. Although he underwent dysphagia rehabilitation, he developed aspiration pneumonia. He stopped food intake by his mouth, and underwent gastrostomy. Subsequently, his general condition worsened, and he died from suffocation because of clogging with sputum.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Findings on chest CT.

This therapeutic complication is serious and can be fatal. Recently, it was reported that durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy might cause bronchomediastinal fistulae in stage III non-small cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, there are few reports on the relationship between ICIs and fistula formation. Acral vascular necrosis, which indicates small vessel vasculitis and leads to ischemia, was introduced as an immune-related adverse event of ICIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case, given that nivolumab caused vasculitis in the area around the stent, vasculitis might have led to necrosis and fistula formation. Furthermore, in our case, besides nivolumab, two other factors, including the esophageal stent and ramucirumab may have been related to the fistulae. It has been reported that placement of an esophageal stent induces tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Since our patient had a second esophageal stent placement before fistula formation, some part of the tissue around the stent may have become necrotic because of the process of inflammation. Furthermore, there are two different reports similar to our case. One report showed that one cycle of pembrolizumab caused tracheoesophageal fistula formation in a patient with squamous cell lung cancer and bronchial stent in the left bronchus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Another study showed that one cycle of pembrolizumab caused esophagobronchial perforations after the placement of an esophageal self-expanding metallic stent in a patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Based on the above considerations, we might be able to explain the process of fistula formation associated with ICIs . Antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, are often used in combination chemotherapy for many types of cancers, and there are some reports about fistula formation and delay in wound healing associated with the use of these drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, 156 days had passed since the last administration of ramucirumab to the development of bronchoesophageal fistula. Because the half-life of ramucirumab is reported to be ~8 days, ramucirumab is unlikely to be a factor in fistula formation. Thus, administration of ICIs might have triggered fistula formation in this patient. Since there are only a few cases of ICIs and fistulas, the attending physician should check whether the patients have a stent before administration of ICIs.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient and his family for providing informed consent for the processing of his personal data for this publication.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>S.Y. received honoraria from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

We describe a 73-year-old woman who presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and melena. A computed tomography scan revealed a hypodense lesion, measuring 6 × 6 × 5 cm, along the upper part of the stomach. An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion, measuring 8 × 6 cm, between the cardia and body of the stomach. Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion, consistent with a lipoma, in the body of the stomach. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. A laparoscopy was offered, and a wedge resection was performed. A histopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lipomatous tumor in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and her hemoglobin level subsequently returned to normal. Overall, clinicians may be unfamiliar with GA because patients may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. Physicians should be aware of the characteristic histopathological features to distinguish GA from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Angiolipomas are subcutaneous benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract have been reported in the liver, and only a few cases of gastric angiolipomas (GA) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. A gastric angiolipoma almost exclusively occurs as a solitary lesion, and patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms. Some patients may be asymptomatic, whereas others may have signs and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. We report a case of gastric angiolipoma in a patient who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools. The patient denied any history of hematemesis, per rectal bleeding, fever or weight loss. She also denied any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, heart burn or reflux disease. Her family history was non-contributive. A review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【6】On examination, she was conscious, oriented, alert and did not show signs of respiratory distress. She looked pale but her vital signs were stable. Cardiovascular and chest examinations were unremarkable. Her abdomen was mildly distended and soft on palpation. It was not tender to palpation and bowel sounds were normal. Her initial workup revealed anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 6.4 g/dl. An abdominal X-ray reveled a normal distribution of bowel gas.\n\n【7】The patient was initially resuscitated successfully. She received 2 l of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells, which resulted in an improvement of her hemoglobin level to 7.5 g/dl. She was also started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy before performing further investigations.\n\n【8】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, chest and pelvis revealed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper part of the stomach . The lesion showed mostly fatty density and multiple lymph node enlargements surrounding the stomach and gastrohepatic ligament, with the largest one measuring 1 cm. The chest and pelvis were unremarkable.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A CT scan of the abdomen showed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper stomach.</u>\n\n【10】An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion measuring 8 × 6 cm between the cardia and body of the stomach . Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with circumscribed margins in the body of the stomach, consistent with a lipoma. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. Endoscopic resection was not suitable in this case lesion too large, that's why laparoscopic resection was chosen here.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Upper endoscopy images showing a large polypoid mass.</u>\n\n【12】A laparoscopy identified a mass in the midsection of the greater curvature of the stomach. LigaSure™ was used to release the omentum from the greater curvature. Next a wedge resection was done by using Endo GIA size 60 (purple). A gross evaluation revealed a homogeneous, yellow-tan colored, fatty mass measuring 6 × 5 × 4 cm, with no area of hemorrhage or necrosis. A histopathological examination revealed a well-demarcated encapsulated lipomatous tumor arising in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Histopathological section of the specimen (hematoxylin and eosin staining) showing varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels ( **A** ). Magnified image of the specimen ( **B** ).</u>\n\n【14】The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was followed up twice after surgery. Her symptoms completely resolved, and her hemoglobin level was stable at 12 g/dl.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are a rare entity composed of mature fat cells and proliferating cells that are usually found in the gastric antrum. The symptoms associated with GA are nonspecific and may range from dyspepsia, vague abdominal discomfort, pain, cramping, bloating and gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. Anemia is also common in these patients and is usually the result of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The patient in our case presented with fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools, which is characteristic in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although our patient presented with a 3-day history of melena and had severe anemia requiring resuscitation, she may have had occult blood in her stool that went undetected until the tumor caused mucosal ulceration and massive bleeding.\n\n【17】On ultrasonography, an angiolipoma appears as a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous, hyperechoic mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The findings on an abdominal CT are usually variable, with the tumor generally appearing as a heterogenous mass with mixed soft tissue density and fat. The lesion in this patient’s case appeared as a solitary, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with smooth borders on a linear endoscopic ultrasound. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hypodense lesion that showed mostly fatty density. Generally, the density of an angiolipoma can vary on CT based on the proportion of the tumor’s components, making it challenging to reach a diagnosis pre-operatively. Thus, the diagnosis is usually made intraoperatively and confirmed following a histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】On gross examination, an angiolipoma is a well-defined, encapsulated mass and its cut surface has a yellowish to reddish appearance based on its fat or vascular component. The tumor is composed of mature adipose cells interspersed with proliferating blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In some cases, fibrin thrombi are observed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections is central to determining the varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels in the tumor. However, immunohistochemical examination is rarely required.\n\n【19】The treatment of angiolipoma depends on the tumor size. In patients with small pedunculated polyps, an endoscopic resection can be offered. However, the diagnosis is usually discovered late when patients already present with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction, making it challenging to perform an endoscopic resection. Given the increased risk of hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation, endoscopic resection may not be recommended for large tumors or those with wide implantation bases. In these cases, it may be more beneficial to surgically excise the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. An excellent prognosis has been reported following surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>, as was the case in our patient, whose symptoms resolved completely after laparoscopy.\n\n【20】Overall, patients with GA may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. This underscores the need for physicians to be aware of the characteristic histopathological features of this tumor to distinguish it from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【22】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【23】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【24】None declared.\n\n【25】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【26】The Research Ethics Committee of Security Forces Hospital approved the report.\n\n【27】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【28】A written consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【29】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【30】Saeed Abdulrahman Alghamdi is the guarantor of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Our case is of a 50-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic lower anterior resection for the rectal cancer with lung metastasis 4 years ago developed cardiac tamponade due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. We performed pericardiocentesis as a temporary life-saving procedure, but pericardial fluid re-accumulated within a few days. She died 23 days after admission. When a patient with advanced colorectal cancer complains dyspnea, we should consider the pericardial metastasis, and perform the proper treatment as this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Distant metastases of colorectal cancer are often hematogenous, and liver metastasis are the most common affected site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pericardial metastasis is one of the rarer patterns of hematogenous metastasis of colorectal cancer, but it is very difficult to diagnose before death and even rarer to cause symptomatic cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We need requiring prompt management within a few hours or days for cardiac tamponade. But there are no established therapy after acute phase. This report describes a rare case of pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer, along with a literature review.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old woman presented to the hospital complaining of anemia. Her medical history included hyperthyroidism, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, urolithiasis, and panic disorder. She has no smoking history. She was diagnosed with a circumferential Type 2 tumor of the upper rectum in colonoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the circumferential wall, with a contrast effect in the upper rectum, a swollen #251 lymph node, and three pulmonary nodules suspected to be metastases . Laparoscopic lower anterior resection and lymph node dissection were performed to prevent intestinal obstruction due to the tumor. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated for lung metastases. A CT scan 4 years postoperatively revealed pericardial thickening . She had no subjective symptoms and only mild pericardial fluid retention, and chemotherapy was continued. Two months after the CT finding, she was brought to the emergency room due to respiratory distress. At admission, she presented with tachycardia and Beck’s triad (hypotension, venous distension and diminished heart sounds). CT scans revealed lung metastases of rectal cancer and accumulation of pleural effusion and pericardial fluid . Cardiologists confirmed the findings of pericardial fluid retention and a sign of right ventricle collapse on echography.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Images at the time of rectal cancer surgery.

Palpitation and dyspnea improved, and the patient’s breathing calmed down. A few days later, re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was noted. We performed a pathological examination of the collected pericardial fluid . In cytology, papanicolaou staining revealed atypical epithelial-like cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular shapes. Alcian blue staining revealed a small number of atypical cells with cytoplasmic mucin. In cell block immunohistochemistry, atypical cells were positive for CEA (Mono) and CDX-2, but negative for Calretinin, WT-1 and CD68 (PGM1). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. She was started on diuretics, but pericardial fluid quickly accumulated, gradually deteriorating her general condition. She died 23 days after emergency hospitalisation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Pathology. (A) Pathology of rectal cancer \\[hematoxylin eosin (HE) stain\\].

The most common mode of metastasis in rectal cancer is hematogenous, with the liver being the most common distant metastatic site, followed by the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This is because, unlike colon cancer, rectal cancer drains from the distal rectal vein through the middle and inferior rectal veins to the internal iliac vein, and thus hematogenous metastasis is likely to occur bypassing the portal hepatic circulation. This may be the reason why the tumor cells directly extended into the pericardial tissue.\n\n【12】Cardiac metastasis of malignant tumors is a relatively common form of metastasis in the terminal stage of cancer. But it is rare to be diagnosed with pericardial metastasis of a tumor during life. This is because many cases of pericardial effusion due to cancer are not accompanied by chest pain and have a poor inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, so they are often not noticed until cardiac tamponade occurs. Symptomatic carcinomatous pericarditis has been reported in male patients with lung cancer and female patients with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, but rarely in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n【13】Treatment of cardiac tamponade in cancer patients includes systemic chemotherapy, pericardial adhesion therapy, and pericardial incision. Pericardial drainage is often used as a temporary life-saving procedure, but re-accumulation of pericardial fluid occurs in roughly 60% of patients treated with pericardial drainage alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Thus, many patients continue to require further treatment to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. Pericardial incision may be performed during the first cardiac tamponade in order to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. However, surgery is considered a difficult option due to concerns about surgical tolerance and postoperative quality of life, as many patients are in the terminal stages of the disease. After releasing pericardial fluid retention, systemic administration of antineoplastic drugs may prolong survival. In recent years, pericardial adhesion therapy by anticancer drugs has been performed as a new treatment to address cardiac tamponade. A JCOG study conducted in Japan reported that bleomycin or cisplatin is recommended for lung cancer, and thiotepa or cisplatin is recommended for breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, no effective anticancer drugs have been reported for colorectal cancer.\n\n【14】A review of the literature using PubMed (keywords ‘colorectal cancer’ and ‘pericardial metastasis’) identified only five cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–10 \\]</u> of cardiac tamponade with an antemortem diagnosis of pericardial metastasis from colorectal cancer, excluding current cases are excluded. In all cases, patients visited the hospital with acute onset respiratory distress. Pericardiocentesis was performed in four of the cases. Surgery was performed with or without pericardiocentesis in three cases; only one was successful, and one died during surgery. Pericardial adhesion therapy was performed in one patient, but the effect was poor. Percutaneous drainage was also performed early in our case, and temporarily relieved the cardiac tamponade. Although early re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was observed after pericardiocentesis in this patient, surgery was not performed because of his general condition and poor prognosis, and the best supportive care policy was adopted.\n\n【15】Advances in medical care have made it possible for patients with distant metastases to survive for a long period of time. When a cancer patient with distant metastasis presents with dyspnea due to pericardial tamponade, it is necessary to not only provide first aid to relieve symptoms but also to submit the collected pericardial fluid for pathological examination to diagnose whether the pericardial effusion is due to pericardial metastasis. And we need to pursue further treatments for long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients with pericardial metastasis.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We explained the clinical trials and disclosure of information to the patient’s family and obtained written consent.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Junichi Mazaki, MD.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Skin lesions mainly occur on the lower extremities. Sheets of immunoblasts and centroblasts are characteristic findings at histologic examination. This case report highlights diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for primary cutaneous B-Cell lymphoma-leg type.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas-leg type (PCBCL-L) usually present in elderly female patients, and with a pathophysiology poorly understood its possible origin is most likely multifactorial involving genes from chronic antigen stimulation from viral or bacterial infections. Diagnosis is mainly determined by skin biopsy that shows diffuse distribution of atypical lymphoid cells showing positivity for markers of CD20+, CD79a+ and negative for CD5 and CD3. It also presents with frequent cutaneous relapses and compared to other cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, that usually have >90–95% survival rate, PCBCL-leg type has a <60% of 5-year survival rate.\n\n【4】This lesions can easily be mistakenly as chronic skin wound infections and many times misleads its diagnosis and treatment, which is why we present the case of young male with a history of chronic leg wound that was treated first as an infection and then finally by obtaining a skin biopsy the final diagnosis of PCBCL-L lymphoma was made. He was started on standard chemotherapy regimen with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Patient presented initial excellent response but he relapsed shortly afterwards. He is currently on salvage chemotherapy with a different regimen consisting of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE) with close monitoring.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】We present the case of a 45-year-old male with past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 9 years on highly active antiretroviral therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension, who presented to the emergency room (ER) with ongoing right lower extremity pain for the last 4 months. At initial work-up, his HIV viral load was undetectable, and his CD4 count was 800 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> (600–1200 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). Four days before hospital admission, the patient noticed new ulcerations on his right lower extremity , associated with increased swelling and subjective febrile episodes. Initially, he was diagnosed with cellulitis, warranting surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy with doxycycline. His condition was stable on discharge, however, his symptoms worsened, and he was readmitted after 12 days.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Right lower extremity chronic wound, overlying scaling and raised erythematous wound was noted.</u>\n\n【8】A thorough physical examination also revealed a new scaling and raised erythematous indurated lesions on his left lower extremity. Antibiotic therapy did not provide any significant improvement in either of both extensive skin lesions. Therefore, he underwent a second wound debridement and a tissue sample for biopsy was obtained. Culture of the tissue grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_ . Skin biopsy showed histological findings consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Bone marrow involvement was ruled out. He was diagnosed with PCBCL-L per pathology report, which showed atypical lymphoid cells in subcutaneous regions with appearance of immunoblasts positive for CD20 and CD79a, consistent with B-cell origin. The patient was discharged for outpatient oncologic evaluation. His right lower extremity, however, became progressively more swollen, painful and with worsening ulcerations and he was readmitted.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Large and round with centrally located nucleoli (immunoblasts) seen in skin lesion biopsy (hematoxylin–eosin).</u>\n\n【10】During his second hospital admission, computed tomography (CT) of the right lower extremity revealed images concerning for myositis. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, meropenem and clindamycin. Surgery and interventional radiology were consulted; they recommended against acute surgical intervention. Before initiation of chemotherapy by the oncology service, he underwent cancer staging with CT of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Fortunately, no findings of lymphadenopathy, lymphoma or metastatic spread to adjacent or distant organs were noticed. Lumbar puncture confirmed no central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and prophylactic methotrexate was administered intrathecally due to the disease’s high risk of CNS involvement. Positron emission tomography/CT scan showed extensive and diffuse subcutaneous indurations with associated hypermetabolic activity involving the right lower extremity, supporting the absence of any neoplastic extension. He started chemotherapy as inpatient with a regimen consisting of a combination of R-CHOP. He tolerated well the regimen without developing significant side effects, and within the next few months, his skin wound decreased in size along with symptomatic improvement. Approximately 3–4 weeks later, CT scans showed there was near complete interval resolution of tissue edema, decreased caliber of reactive right inguinal and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes and no new lymphadenopathy. Due to the patient’s good clinical baseline performance and age, the decision by the oncology team was to pursue treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate for 5 cycles with excellent response initially, but after his fifth cycle, patient was found to have significant progression of cutaneous lesions. During his most recent hospital admission, he started a salvage treatment with R-ICE and the medical care team will continue to monitor response.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Primary cutaneous lymphomas are categorized as non-Hodgkin lymphomas involving exclusively the skin. Their incidence is 10 cases per million habitants per year. The vast majority of cutaneous lymphomas originate from T-cells, but 20–30% are attributed to B-cell neoplasms. Primary cutaneous lymphomas are classified based on their histological origin. It has been described that they can arise from the marginal zone, the follicle center of the B-cells, or from large B-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Differential diagnosis can include indolent skin lymphomas that include primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) and primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The marginal zone B-cell type is considered as one of the extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Its median age of presentation is 50–54 years and even up to 90 years, occurring more often in men than women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) is considered to be the most indolent type, due to an excellent prognosis, patient median age of presentation of 50 years and higher frequency of appearance in head or neck (60%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both primary cutaneous marginal zone and follicle center lymphomas are considered to have minimal risk of extracutaneous spread, making them less likely to be aggressive compared to PCBCL-L.\n\n【14】The PCBCL can be divided by the affected zone; the most studied one is limited to the lower extremities, known as a PCBCL-leg type (PCBCL-L). This subtype is very aggressive and involves a monotonous proliferation of centroblasts. These lymphomas usually affect elderly women and present with rapidly growing tumors in one or both lower extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Its pathophysiology is still not well understood. Viral or bacterial infections seem to be predisposing factors. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients with HIV, have been associated with the development of this subtype of tumors, but proper studies that demonstrate this relationship are still lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient suffered of HIV for 9 years, raising suspicion for this to be a very likely predisposing factor.\n\n【16】The cutaneous pattern is usually characterized by nodular, and sharply demarcated wounds. The neoplasm is mostly allocated to the dermis, where usually neoplastic B-cells can resemble normal B-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The PCBCL-L has a tendency to relapse, in those cases, it tends to affect other zones of the body. Location in the lower extremities and existence of multiple lesions are poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Markers from immunohistochemistry of the skin biopsy are CD20, CD19 antigen, BCL2  and BCL6. The PCBCL-L has an increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, such as mutations in p14 and p16, key genes that once mutated can result in the destabilization of the p53 protein, resulting in cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Neoplastic B-cells strongly express BCL-2 on inmunohistochemistry.</u>\n\n【18】Treatment should be selected based on the type of lymphoma and its stage. These regimens are based on retrospective studies from case series or case reports. Valid randomized control trials are inexistent. Chemotherapy is indicated in PCBCL-L, and prior case reports showed good response with R-CHOP, but relapses are frequent, and treatment may not be curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】Neoplasm of the skin should be suspected in HIV patients with chronic skin wounds that are not responsive to antibiotics or other interventions. Timely diagnosis can help change the management plan drastically. PCBCL-L respond rapidly to chemotherapy with R-CHOP regimen but relapses are common.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no relevant acknowledgment.

A non-contrasted head CT was obtained, which demonstrated a hyperdense image compatible with an intracerebral hemorrhage in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe. The patient displayed no neurological deficit during the consultation and a subsequent MRI showed a temporoinsular bleeding lesion that was suggestive of an atypic meningioma or a metastatic lesion. Afterwards, neck, chest and abdomen CT scans were performed, and the imaging ruled out a secondary neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion, and a solid tumor was found with no bleeding associated. The pathology reported a WHO I fibroblastic meningioma.\n\n【2】fibroblastic meningioma , intracerebral hemorrhage , magnetic resonance image , computerized tomography\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Hemorrhagic strokes account for 15% of all strokes and are widely accepted to be deadlier than ischemic strokes. The 30-day mortality rate of patients presenting intracranial hemorrhage is ~50%, in comparison with an estimated 20% rate for patients that have experienced ischemic strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The most common cause of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is thought to be chronic hypertension. The small perforating end branches are especially vulnerable to damage from elevated blood pressure in locations such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and pons.\n\n【6】Although all brain tumors are known to convey a risk of bleeding, medical teams tend to associate tumoral intra-cerebral hemorrhages with the presence of malignancies. The types of malignant tumors that are most associated with localized hemorrhages are glioblastomas, lymphomas, oligodendrogliomas and metastatic tumors, the last of which encompass melanomas, choriocarcinomas, renal cell carcinomas and bronchogenic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Contrastingly, the types of benign tumors that have been associated with intracerebral hemorrhages include meningiomas, pituitary adenomas and hemangioblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】The factors that determine the prognosis and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the patient’s age, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, the location of hematoma and the presence of an intra-ventricular component. All the aforementioned factors are also considered to calculate the intracranial hemorrhage score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 50-year-old patient presented to the emergency room complaining of having suffered, for an entire day, from a sudden pulsatile hemicranial headache of moderate intensity, associated with nausea, no emetic episodes and that was also not responding to the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Due to the persistence of the symptomatology, the patient sought medical attention and the initial diagnosis suggested a secondary headache. After careful examination, the patient was found to be free of neurological deficit and the medical team performed a brain CT scan.\n\n【10】The resulting image documented a cortico-subcortical hyperdense lesion (50 Hounsfield Units) in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe, measuring 41 × 32 × 36 mm and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc, commonly associated with cases of vasogenic edema compromising the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The amplitude of the left lateral ventricle and the width of the regional subarachnoid space sulci had decreased on account of the lesion, and a minimal deviation of the midline structures to the right and incipient left uncal herniation was noted. To rule out an underlying vascular malformation, the medical team performed a CT angiogram, which did not show any aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Head computerized tomography CT.</u>\n\n【12】Due to the absence of neurological deficit, the medical team propounded that a brain hemorrhage could not be adjudged as the sole etiology and subsequently ordered an MRI scan. The results revealed a lobulated mass with prominent enhancement after the gadolinium injection and marked hypo intensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information. A zone in contact with the internal bone table was observed at the lateral margin of the lesion, as well as various dark regions at the susceptibility weighted sequence, suggesting blood products or calcium. The FLAIR sequence showed significant surrounding vasogenic edema. The aforementioned characteristics were found to be consistent with an atypical meningioma or a metastatic lesion .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|MRI—fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|MRI—susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|MRI—gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequence.</u>\n\n【16】Additional neck, chest and abdominal CT scans were performed, and the results allowed the ruling out of metastatic disease, furthermore, increasing the probability of an underlying primary tumor of the central nervous system. The patient underwent surgery, where resulted in the identification of a solid lesion, without an intra-tumoral hemorrhagic component, as previously suspected in accordance with the pre-operative imaging findings .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Macroscopic lesion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 6**|删除段之间换行|Macroscopic lesion.</u>\n\n【19】After the surgical intervention, the patient presented a stable neurological evolution with no apparent deterioration and was discharged following 4 days of post-operative surveillance. During the post-operative follow-up, the pathology report revealed the existence of spindle cells fascicles intersected along with variable collagen deposition and occasional cellular whorls 通用删除1(英):<u>(in the hematoxylin–eosin staining— Fig. 7 )</u>. The tumor also tested positive for EMA in patches and Vimentin . These findings were deemed compatible with the diagnosis of fibroblastic meningioma WHO I, emphasizing that they were not suggestive of anaplastic meningioma or atypical meningioma.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 7**|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin–eosin staining.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 8**|删除段之间换行|Vimentin staining.</u>\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】The radiological findings in this case are particularly intriguing, due to the fact that the initial evaluation suggested a large acute hemorrhagic component—because of its high density in scans (50 Hounsfield Units) and its marked hypointensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information—but, at the time of the surgical resection, a mass of solid consistency was found, without any type of hemorrhage.\n\n【24】Given that acute blood is markedly hyperdense in comparison to the brain parenchyma, its tomographic diagnosis regularly does not pose a high grade of difficulty for medical teams. However, in this case, we were faced with an entirely solid lesion that mimicked an intracerebral hemorrhage. The tests ordered by the medical team included a CT angiogram to rule out a possible vascular etiology, as the patient’s symptomatology was not consistent with a primary hemorrhage. In the authors’ opinion, this is the most significant aspect of this case study, in terms of its possible contribution to medical literature and its potential of serving as reference material for other healthcare professionals assessing patients who report a similar array of symptoms.\n\n【25】In developing nations, medical institutions are typically constrained by multiple external factors that directly compromise the availability of primary imaging techniques, such as MRI scanning. In cases where diagnostic MRI equipment is found to be entirely unavailable, medical teams must judiciously evaluate each patient’s condition, to determine whether he should be immediately referred to a higher level facility or remain under surveillance after a CT scan. In this case, the patient presented to the ER with a diagnosis of a ‘large intracerebral hemorrhage’ but displayed no neurological deficit. Such a scenario was deemed unlikely by the medical team, given the absence of cognitive impairment, and thus, the symptoms were thought to be the result of a slow-growing lesion.\n\n【26】In accordance with the findings of this case, the authors pose that all medical teams evaluating the results of a Head CT scan must consider the correlation between the images and the patient’s neurological status (i.e. a patient with no neurological deficit, associated with a large hyperdense lesion, most probably relates to a tumor with intra-lesional hemorrhage, rather than a single hemorrhage). Additionally, this case allowed the authors to identify a valuable opportunity in the development of a computer-based algorithm—specially directed at medical centers with CT scanners, but lacking MRI imaging equipment—which marks the cases in which an extra imaging study should be ordered, starting with those ‘hyperdense lesions’ located in eloquent areas with no neurological deficit association.\n\n【27】As it was stated before, the patient’s neurological status during admission was undamaged, which is highly unlikely in patients with hemorrhages in the same location and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc. Had that been the case for our patient, at least, a minimum degree of neurological compromise would have been expected, as the volume of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is directly proportional to morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Type III collagen is a member of the fibrillar collagen family and is colocalized with the most abundant member of the family, type I collagen, in such tissues as blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, leading the medical team to the conclusion that the high content of intercellular collagen and reticulin was the most probable cause for the hyperdensity evidenced in the tomographic image and the hypodensity on T2 weighted images, and for the dark areas evidenced on the susceptibility weighted images, thereby mimicking an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Julian Gualdrón-Durán in the edition and preparation of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The case report was reviewed and accepted by the institutional review board from our institution.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Full verbal and written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Oscar Hernando Feo-Lee is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

On the other hand, there are few cases of abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia associated with fetal ascites due to fetal hydrops caused by fetal anemia have been reported. We report a case of fetal chylous ascites without anemia, resulting in abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia and flabby skin. At 17 weeks of gestation, fetal ascites was first detected and deteriorated without anemia. At 28, 33 and 36 weeks of gestation, paracentesis was performed three times because of cardiovascular impairment, confirming chylous ascites. After birth, the baby exhibited a flabby skin and lateral abdominal wall hypoplasia, resulting in difficulties in maintaining a sitting posture at 10 months of age. The genetic test using the TruSight One Sequencing Panels found no genetic variants.

Although tissue hypoxia has been suggested to may be caused by fetal anemia in those cases, the precise etiology remains unclear. Herein, we report a case that manifested an isolated abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia and a remarkable flabby skin following massive fetal persistent chylous ascites without anemia _in utero_ . He did not harbor known mutations as a cause of a genetic disease, which resulted in difficulties of keeping a sitting posture until 10 months of age. This case demonstrates the possibility that fetal persistent ascites without anemia _in utero_ might be related to the congenital abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Physical examination of the newborn at birth, showing abdominal skin wrinkles ( **a** ) and bilateral abdominal wall projection ( **b** ).</u>\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 39-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, was referred to our hospital at 13 weeks of gestation because of positive anti-M antibody at the serological screening test. Although no abnormal finding was found on ultrasound examination (US) at the initial visit, fetal left hydrothorax was detected at 15 weeks and ascites at 17 weeks. Maternal serological tests for parvovirus B19 (PB19), cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella and syphilis were negative, and amniocentesis confirmed a normal karyotype denoted as 46 XY. Although fetal hydrothorax spontaneously regressed from 19 weeks and completely disappeared at 21 weeks, fetal ascites deteriorated, and fetal echo revealed holosystolic tricuspid valve regurgitation at 21 weeks. At 27 weeks of gestation, reverse flow in the ductus venosus and increased preload index in the inferior vena cava without an elevated peak systolic velocity of the middle cerebral artery occurred, suggesting cardiovascular impairment. At 28 weeks of gestation, paracentesis was performed to improve the fetal cardiovascular impairment, and fetal ascitic fluid contained 92% lymphocytes, deducing chylous origin. A second paracentesis was also performed at 33 weeks for the same reason. However, fetal ascites increased again, and maternal abdominal distension with polyhydramnios worsened. Therefore, elective cesarean section was performed due to previous cesarean section at 36 0/7 weeks of gestation along with the third paracentesis in order for the baby to be delivered easier.\n\n【8】A male infant weighing 3488 g with a symmetrically enlarged lateral abdomen associated with abdominal skin folds and cryptorchidism was delivered . Total parenteral nutrition was introduced, and intravenous administration of octreotide was initiated since Day 6, followed by a low-fat formula diet containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) from Day 15. Octreotide was terminated on Day 36, and breast feeding was started on Day 59. US and computed tomography showed worsened ascites after increasing breast feeding; therefore, breast feeding was switched to low-fat formula containing MCT diet on Day 77. The ascites decreased, and the baby was discharged on Day 92. The baby started rehabilitation to improve his abdominal muscle strength and movement. At 10 months of age, he had difficulty keeping a sitting posture, although neurological findings were normal. At 11 months of age, magnetic resonance imaging showed an oblique and transverse abdominal muscle hypoplasia . Next, orchiopexy was performed at 12 months of age, and we confirmed that his oblique and transverse muscles are very thin and vulnerable. Genetic blood test was performed using TruSight One Sequencing Panels (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA), which covered ~4800 disease-associated genes, and no genetic variants were found. Although he exhibited normal fine and gross motor functions without any neurodevelopmental disabilities at 19 months of age, cosmetic problems of abdominal distension and flabby skin persisted.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (axial view) of the abdomen obtained at 11 months of age, below the umbilical level.

In contrast, the rectus abdominis muscle is thin to a lesser degree 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.</u>\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Abdominal muscle hypoplasia following the fetal ascites is previously reported. Embryological studies suggest that diastasis recti abdominis would occur due to disruptive phenomena before the fusion of myotomes during the 8 weeks of gestation, whereas muscular hypoplasia should arise from the later phenomena 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only four case reports of abdominal muscle hypoplasia associated with fetal ascites have been published in English language 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. One of them had ascites from 22 weeks due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), whereas the others manifested ascites from 20 to 22 weeks due to PB19 infection. All of them showed lateral abdominal bulging at birth, having hypoplastic oblique and transverse abdominal muscles with normal recti abdominis. Travan _et al_ . supposed that muscle hypoplasia is not only attributed to mechanical compression with vascular compromise inducing ischemia due to fetal ascites but also to fetal anemia caused by TTTS and PB19 infections, which provoke tissue hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Note that our case had chylous ascites from 17 weeks without anemia; therefore, its pathogenesis is different from the four previously reported cases. Several genetic disorders, such as prune belly syndrome (PBS), are supposedly caused by abdominal muscle defects, and PBS is characterized by laxity of the abdominal wall musculature, bilateral cryptorchidism and urinary tract anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our case did not present uropathy during the prenatal and postnatal periods, suggesting it was different from PBS.\n\n【12】Congenital chylothorax and chylous ascites could occur during fetal life due to lymph leakage into the pleural and/or peritoneal cavities, and their causes include inappropriate chyle transport toward the main circulation because of aplasia, hypoplasia, obstruction or thoracic duct severance; they are idiopathic in numerous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, spontaneous regression of primary fetal hydrothorax commonly occurs in 9–22% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, whereas only one report described a case of fetal chylous ascites that spontaneously regressed before birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this case, cytological examination of the fetal peritoneal fluid revealed chylous ascites. Therefore, the hydrothorax might be chylothorax; however, although chylothorax regressed during pregnancy, fetal chylous ascites occurred and persisted throughout pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on such a case, although the etiology remains unclear.\n\n【13】In conclusion, our case demonstrates that persistent fetal ascites from the early second trimester without anemia could be associated with congenital abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Shunsuke Tamaru.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is often associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies. Classical PG is characterized by painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined border, often developing at sites of injury because of the typical pathergy phenomenon. Because of its polymorphic presentation, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. We present a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a young female patient with ulcerative colitis. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG, to the best of our knowledge this is the first case precipitated by TENS. We report a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus and highlight the challenges that the diagnosis of this relatively rare pathology poses to the clinician.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis, a rare inflammatory disease affecting the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There are several types of PG, including classical (ulcerative), bullous, pustular, granulomatous superficial (vegetative), peristomal and post-surgical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The classical form is the most frequent presentation and occurs mainly on the lower extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Classical PG is characterized by the development of sterile inflammatory pustules, which expand into painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. PG may occur in the absence of an underlying pathology, but in up to two-thirds of cases it is associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. IBD is the most common comorbidity in younger PG patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. PG occurs in ~1–2% of IBD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Herein, we report a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 27-year-old woman was referred to our Burn Unit for the management of painful, progressive ulcers located on her legs. She had presented bilateral ankle tendinopathy 5 weeks earlier, for which she underwent TENS sessions (mild electrical currents were administered using electrode pads placed on the skin surface of the lateral and medial sides of both ankles). Following the fifth session, bluish-mauve swellings appeared on the left lateral and medial malleoli and on the right lateral malleolus, which ulcerated and extended despite topical cortisone. She reported no fever or systemic symptoms. Daily local bactericidal dressing and successive antibiotic therapies with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime and piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in the pejoration of the lesions. A computed-tomography scan of the ankles revealed infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue but no bone damage. As there was no improvement, she was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of infected electric burns. Detailed anamnesis revealed a 12-year-old history of UC, stable under mesalazine, not mentioned earlier. Physical examination on admission showed a large purplish ulcer of 16/7 cm, situated on the left lateral malleolus and two smaller ulcers on the left medial and right lateral malleoli . The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Biology tests were normal except for moderate normocytic hypochromic anemia and a C reactive protein value of 52.8 mg/l (normal range 0–5 mg/l). Immunological (rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies and HLA B27), serological tests (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Rickettsia and Leishmania), bacterial and fungal wound swabs and blood cultures were negative. Skin biopsies revealed a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils, with a site of deep abscedation, compatible with PG . Special stains (Periodic Acid Schiff, Wade-Fite, Ziehl-Neelsen and Gram) were negative for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Immunosuppressive treatment with high dose oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) followed by the addition of ciclosporin 1 month later, when steroid tapering began, combined with topical tacrolimus and adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy resulted in a favorable evolution, with complete resolution of the lesions and characteristic cribriform scars at 3.5 months .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|**Panels A–C** : aspect of the wounds at referral to our Burn Unit ( **Panel A** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel B** : left leg, medial malleolus, **Panel C** : right leg, lateral malleolus). **Panels D–F** : follow-up at 3.5 months of treatment ( **Panel D** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel E** : left leg, medial malleolus **Panel F** : right leg, lateral malleolus).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin–eosin stain, showing a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils ( **Panel A** : ×3,46 magnification, **Panel B** : ×20 magnification).</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】PG is the second most frequent dermatologic manifestation of IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It occurs mainly when the IBD is active but can also manifest during quiescent periods or precede the IBD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Because of its polymorphic presentation, frequent association with various systemic diseases and ability to imitate other conditions, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis are common in PG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In our patient, lesions mimicked infected burn wounds, leading to misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and clinical deterioration. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by PG and the importance of thorough patient anamnesis, as the patient’s UC history first raised the suspicion of PG.\n\n【10】To this day, PG remains mainly a clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsies are recommended to exclude other causes of cutaneous ulceration. The histopathology of PG typically shows neutrophilic inflammation, but it is nonspecific (infections and other neutrophilic dermatosis may have similar findings) and can vary based on PG subtype, ulcer stage, timing and site of biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. To date there is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of PG. Su _et al._ proposed in 2004 a diagnostic tool for classical PG requiring two major and two minor criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, but in this algorithm PG remains an exclusion diagnosis, which can be impractical for clinical decision. In 2018, Maverakis _et al._ proposed new criteria based on the Delphi Consensus of International Experts, requiring one major and four minor criteria, and no longer rendering PG as a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. More recently, Jockenhöfer _et al._ developed another diagnostic tool, the PARACELSUS score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient met diagnostic criteria with each of the three above-mentioned scores.\n\n【11】There is no standardized treatment of PG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Topical treatment with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be tried in mild forms or those not associated with systemic disease. For systemic treatment, corticosteroids are first-line 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Corticosteroids may be combined with immunomodulatory agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors or interleukin 1 inhibitors have been increasingly proposed in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. In addition, analgesia and wound care are two cornerstones of PG management. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be a helpful adjuvant.\n\n【12】PG lesions may be precipitated by minor traumas, a phenomenon known as ‘pathergy’. Because of this phenomenon, surgery is not recommended as it may worsen the lesions and delay the healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG lesions—Ichikawa _et al._ described PG lesions appearing at the site of the grounding pad of an electric scalpel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>—this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of PG precipitated by TENS. We hypothesize that in this case the lesions were triggered by the electrical stimulus in a patient in which the underlying UC put her at a higher risk of developing PG.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we present a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus, while also highlighting the challenges that the diagnosis and management of this relatively rare pathology pose to the clinician.\n\n【14】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【15】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【16】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【17】The authors received no specific funding for this work.\n\n【18】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【19】Case reports are waived by the Ethics Committee of our institution.\n\n【20】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【21】The patient provided written consent for publication of the case report and accompanying images.\n\n【22】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【23】DI Costescu Strachinaru.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

These devices have helped in preventing problems associated with fecal incontinence. Although highly efficient, these devices can also lead to certain complications including rectal ulcer and lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Here, we report a case of a 56-year-old male being treated for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation, who had significant lower GI bleed while being on FMS for stool incontinence. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed multiple rectal ulcers with one large ulcer having a visible pulsating vessel. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of rectal ulcers and GI bleed associated with use of FMS.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fecal incontinence remains a common and difficult problem for hospitalized patients. It is reported in ⁓50% of patients admitted to hospitals and long care facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It can occur in both sexes and patients of all ages. Managing critically ill patients with diarrhea or fecal incontinence is a challenge as it can lead to infections, skin breakdown and ulcerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> Several solutions for fecal incontinence existed including medications such as loperamide and opiate, products such as absorbent pads, rectal foley catheters, artificial sphincters, even colostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the past decade, several fecal management systems (FMSs) have been introduced to deal with diarrhea and incontinence, especially in immobile and critically ill patients. These systems have helped in reducing perianal skin excoriation, infection spread and the overall nursing requirements. Despite the effectiveness and a high safety profile of these devices, there have been reports of adverse events in the published literature. These complications result mostly from pressure injury or traumatic device removal; and may include rectal ulcer, fissures and major traumatic rectal bleed. Here, we present a case of 56-year-old male who had major lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as result of rectal ulcers from FMS use.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old male with extensive past medical history including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), intracranial bleed from aneurysm rupture, on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, who presented with complain of shortness of breath. Patient was started on treatment for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. While in the hospital the patient became obtunded and was intubated for airway protection. Patient was upgraded to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.\n\n【6】While in the MICU patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation and was started on a heparin drip. Patient also was found to have fecal incontinence and a Dignishield FMS was placed. In 2 days after placement of rectal tube, patient had an episode of hematochezia that was small in amount. Heparin was put on hold and hemoglobin was closely monitored. Three days later patient had another large episode of hematochezia, with ⁓150 mL of blood loss and visible clots resulting in hemodynamic instability. Code fusion was initiated and patient was adequately resuscitated with blood transfusion and intravenous fluids. A computed tomographic angiography didn’t reveal any active bleed in the GI tract. Gastroenterology service was consulted who performed an urgent upper endoscopy to rule out any upper GI bleed. The upper endoscopy failed to reveal any bleeding source.\n\n【7】Patient then had bowel prep with polyethylene glycol and underwent colonoscopy the next day. Colonoscopy revealed multiple superficial rectal ulcerations varying in size . It also showed one large deep ulcer, 2 cm in size, was seen in the rectum with a pulsating visible vessel in ulcer base , 3 mL of diluted epinephrine (1:10 000) was injected in ulcer base followed by application of three endoclips to the ulcer with adequate hemostasis. This patient had a previous screening colonoscopy 1 year prior that was negative for any rectal ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|White arrows shows multiple rectal ulcers.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|White arrow shows ulcer closure with endoclips.</u>\n\n【10】The rectal tube was discontinued after these findings. Patient was also started on daily polyethylene glycol to avoid constipation. He completed his course of treatment without any further bleeding and was eventually discharged from the hospital.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Fecal incontinence is the involuntary recurrent passage of stool. Its more commonly seen in patients with advance age, multiparous women, history of obstetric complications and those with anorectal disease or surgery. The availability of FMS provides effective management for fecal incontinence in patients of both short and long care facilities.\n\n【13】Currently there are three main FMSs available in the United States; these includes Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec); Bowel Management System (Hollister) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard). All these FMS have a catheter with an inflatable balloon on one end, which keeps the catheter from being dislodged from the rectum; on the other end of the catheter is an external collection bag for stool collection.\n\n【14】There are potential complications associated with the use of a FMS, these can include loss of anal sphincter muscle tone, infection, abdominal distention, bowel obstruction and perforation, ulcers and rectal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our Patient also developed rectal ulcer with severe GI bleed. The mechanism by which these ulcers develop is due to pressure injury caused by the inflatable balloon. In addition, the buildup of stool above the catheter may also contribute to pressure on the bowel wall resulting in necrosis. This follows similar mechanism as seen in stercoral perforation due large stool burden in severely constipated patients. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Both major brands i.e. Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard) recommend inflating the cuff with 45 mL of tap water and to discontinue use after 29 days. All the patient reported in literature developed bleeding complications between day 3 to 3 weeks post insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Review of literature shows ⁓14 cases reporting rectal bleed in patients on these stool management systems. In five of these case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8–11 \\]</u> the patients were on therapeutic dose of heparin, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. This was also the case in our patient who was on therapeutic dose heparin for atrial fibrillation. Although no studies are available that discuss association between anticoagulation use and ulcer bleed in these patients, both the cases reported in the literature and our case, should keep physicians cautious about severe bleed from rectal ulcer in patients using FMS while on anticoagulation.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】Our case highlights the fact that FMS although safe can have severe complications. Ulcer formation occurs as a result of pressure injury from these devices that employ an inflatable cuff mechanism. Also, physicians need to be cautious when using these devices in patient on anticoagulation and should reassess the need for these catheters every few days.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muhammad Haider (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Madiha Fatima Master (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Muhammad Master (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Evelina Khalilova (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Maga Daoud (Reviewed and edited the manuscript) and Jay Nfonoyim (Reviewed and edited the manuscript)</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DISCLOSURES\n-----------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have nothing to disclose.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>COMPETING INTERESTS\n-------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval not required.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATE AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The corresponding author may be reached out for clinical data.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent policy.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muhammad Haider.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

As respiratory function was severely reduced, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed showing bilateral peripheral filling of bronchiolii and alveolii with ‘tree-in-bud’ configuration combined with bilateral peribronchial and peripheral spiculated nodules.

A 69-year-old woman presented with an ischemic electrocardiogram changes during a medical check-up. Coronary computed tomography angiography showed right coronary artery (RCA) ectasia associated with a giant aneurysm originating from the distal RCA. She was asymptomatic and exhibited no risk factors, including Kawasaki disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or family history. The patient underwent surgery for giant coronary aneurysms to prevent rupture. The aneurysm was on the peripheral side of the right coronary artery; hence, coronary artery bypass was not performed. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm revealed degeneration due to atherosclerosis. She was prescribed warfarin and aspirin for thrombus prevention.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) and coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) are aneurysmal dilatations of the coronary artery. Both of these diseases show dilatation of at least 1.5 times the diameter of normal coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. CAE is defined as diffuse dilatation of coronary arteries more than one-third of their length, and CAA is defined as dilatation of less than one-third of the length of the coronary artery. Although considered an infrequent finding during coronary angiography, the prevalence of CAE is reported to be between 0.3% and 5.3%; likewise, the prevalence of CAA is reported to be between 1.5% and 4.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Although the most common aetiology for the development of CAE and CAA has been found to be atherosclerosis, there have been few reports of CAE cases associated with CAA. We report a rare case of CAE and a large CAA, which is unparalleled among the reported cases.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 69-year-old woman presented with ischemic changes in the inferior lead , as noted on electrocardiography during a medical check-up. The patient underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate ischaemia and was found to have a coronary aneurysm, and chest radiography showed a protruding coronary aneurysm . Coronary computed tomography angiography showed right coronary artery (RCA) ectasia associated with a giant aneurysm originating from the distal RCA . The diameters of the ectasia and aneurysm were 15 and 70 mm, respectively. Coronary angiography showed no stenosis or dilatation in the left coronary artery , whereas the right CAE was observed along its entire length . A giant CAA was also observed . She was asymptomatic and exhibited no risk factors, including Kawasaki disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or family history. CAA was so large that an aneurysmectomy was performed to prevent rupture. The aneurysm and CAE  were exposed to cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass performed through a median sternotomy. The aneurysmal wall was incised, and the inflow hole was confirmed with antegrade cardioplegia. There was neither an outflow nor fistula in the aneurysm. The inflow hole was closed with a pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene mattress suture inside the aneurysm without closing the coronary artery distal to the RCA . The aneurysmal sac was then punctured. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm revealed degeneration due to atherosclerosis . A coronary CT scan showed no inflow into the CAA postoperatively . The patient was prescribed warfarin and aspirin for the prevention of thrombus in the dilated coronary arteries in the CAE to prevent myocardial infarction. The patient is still recovering without any postoperative complications and is doing well as an outpatient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The electrocardiogram at the time of admission shows negative T waves in 2, 3 and aVf inductions.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography shows aneurysm as protruding mass.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|(A) The CAE is seen (①).

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to save patients. However, until now, there has been no consensus on the optimal strategy for the treatment of CAE and CAA due to a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials or official guidelines. The optimal strategy should be individualized, based on the size and morphology of the aneurysms and associated lesions, for each patient. In this case, since this patient did not have any symptoms, coronary ectasia and a huge aneurysm were incidentally found with electrocardiogram during a medical check-up. Because the size of the aneurysm was enormous and the risk of rupture was high, we performed surgical resection of the aneurysm. As the aneurysm was located in the peripheral RCA, we did not perform coronary artery bypass grafting. Atherosclerosis is considered the common etiologic factor responsible for CAE in adults, whereas Kawasaki disease is the most common cause in children and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient did not have a history of Kawasaki disease, and the histopathological results of the ectasia and aneurysms showed degeneration due to atherosclerosis. However, there were no risk factors for atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic lesions in other coronary arteries. There have also been reports of coronary aneurysms that developed after the primary coronary artery dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although CAA usually develops with sudden chest pain, such as acute coronary syndrome, and has a high fatality rate, it is possible that in our patient, this disease occurred asymptomatically, and the tunica media subsequently became vulnerable and formed a coronary aneurysm.\n\n【17】CAE is still present in this case.

They are discovered incidentally in most cases. Data on their incidence, diagnosis, prognosis and management remain insufficient. The discovery is usually made at an advanced stage of lung cancer with the presence of metastases to other organs. We reported the case of a patient undergoing oncology follow-up for lung adenocarcinoma with discovery of adrenal gland metastases and a solitary pancreatic metastatic mass. His management remains palliative chemotherapy. Surgical treatment is not yet codified in these cases and remains at the discretion of the multidisciplinary oncology teams.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lung cancers are diagnosed at a metastatic stage in 40–50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Common metastases sites of lung cancers remain liver, adrenal, bone and kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Pancreatic metastases of lung cancers are rare and incidental. It is usually seen at an advanced stage of the disease with other associated metastases. Data on its incidence, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment remain poor. Its incidence is 12% in post-mortem patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its prognosis remains guarded given the often advanced stage of the pathology. Several methods of treatment as surgery management, chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy were proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】These metastases may raise a diagnosis issue between a primary pancreatic or secondary lung cancer localization. In most cases, this diagnosis is made at a stage of multiple metastases in patients known to have primary lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the literature, most of the data have been provided by post-mortem examination of patients with primary lung cancer. However, studies are still needed to improve our knowledge of these pancreatic metastases and to improve the coding of their management. Imaging examinations, in particular the computed tomography (CT) scan, play an essential role in the discovery of these pancreatic metastases. It remains the routine imaging examination for monitoring patients in oncology.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We reported a case of 69-year-old male who was diagnosed since a year for lung adenocarcinoma. His treatment based on chemotherapy according to the line treatment of medical oncology of the hospital. He was in good health without any symptomatology. During his follow-up, thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan revealed a roughly rounded, poorly defined lung mass with irregular in shape, enhanced at the periphery after contrast media injection .\n\n【7】Two bilateral adrenal masses were also discovered as hypodense, poorly defined, irregularly, and enhanced after injection of contrast medium .\n\n【8】A hypodense pancreatic corporal mass, roughly rounded, with irregular contours, enhanced after injection of contrast medium, without dilation of the Wirsung. There is associated dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and the main bile duct . On ultrasound, this mass corresponds to a rounded, heterogeneous, echogenic lesion with discrete peripheral vascularization on color Doppler . A endoscopic biopsy for pancreatic mass was performed to confirm the diagnostic of non-primary tumor of pancreas. Histology confirmed a metastatic mass of lung cancer.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest CT scan injected (portal phase) in axial section in a parenchymal ( **A** ) and mediastinal ( **B** ) window showing a pulmonary mass with a necrotic center highlighted in the periphery in upper right lobe (red star).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT scan injected (delayed phase: 10 min) in axial section ( **A** and **B** ) showing bilateral adrenal masses .

There were no surgical indications according to the multidisciplinary consultation. The patient changed the treatment line due to multiple metastases, essentially involving chemotherapy without any radiotherapy.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The most frequent metastases of lung cancer are liver, brain, adrenal and bone. Pancreatic metastases remain rare. There is not enough data on this issue. These pancreatic metastases of lung cancers would represent <5% in patients living with a pancreatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. According to Adsay _et al._ , in autopsies performed on 4955 patients with metastases, the rate of pancreatic metastases was 1.6% and the primary sites in order of increase were renal cell carcinoma followed by lung cancer and colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In Japan, Maeno _et al._ found 26 cases of pulmonary metastases (3%) in 850 patients with lung cancer. In order of frequency, pancreatic metastases involved the following histological types: small cell carcinoma 10.5% and only 2.3% of adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of these metastases remains difficult clinically, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery for other cancers, and is in most cases discovered on imaging, most often on CT scan. The other major difficulty is the distinction between primary and secondary pancreatic tumors. For Klein _et al._ , the CT features that may point to a pancreatic metastasis are the presence of other organ metastases, then often well-limited and more hypodense compared with a primary tumor and the intense enhancement indicative of the hypervascular nature of the metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This distinction is even more difficult in solitary pancreatic masses. In their series, Maeno found that the usual pattern of pancreatic metastasis involved a solitary nodule in 73%, multiple nodules in 11.5% and diffuse swelling in 15.4% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most metastatic lesions are located in the head of the pancreas, leading to obstruction of the bile ducts and jaundice. For some authors in the case of lung cancers, the majority are located in the head or the body of the pancreas with ~76% locating in the head in small cell lung carcinomas, followed by the body in 15% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Generally, three aspects have been described most commonly a solitary pancreatic mass between 50 and 80%. The second aspect is that of diffuse infiltration of the pancreas through the glandular septa between 15 and 44% and the third aspect is that of multiple pancreatic nodules resulting in extensive destruction of the lobules of the pancreatic parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】From a therapeutic point of view, there is no real consensus on the management of these pancreatic metastases. Indeed, the discovery of pancreatic metastasis is made at an advanced stage of primary cancer, lung cancer. Very few cases of surgery are performed. It would be better indicated in cases where the primary lung tumor is well controlled and with a solitary pancreatic mass. In a Japanese study of patients with pancreatic metastases of lung cancer, only eight cases of resection of pancreatic metastases were recorded from 1998 to 2006. All of these cases were with metastases from other organs (liver, adrenals and brain) after satisfactory control of these metastases by chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Adler _et al._ found a low rate of pancreatectomy for pancreatic metastasis of lung cancer with only eight cases of surgery out of 399 patients; this is due to the poor prognosis but also the late discovery of these metastases from lung cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The surgical management of metastases would be an excellent therapeutic, that means to improve the survival of patients outside adjuvant treatments, but no data on this management are yet known in this indication, and therefore needs further study. Roland _et al._ found a survival time after the discovery of pancreatic metastases from lung cancer of ~8.7 months (1–28 months) and only 4 of the 27 patients had received surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, therefore, have an essential role in the management of these patients with metastases, particularly because of the late stage of the disease with the presence of metastases to other organs.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEGEMENTS\n---------------\n\n【19】We thank the following individuals for their review of earlier drafts of the manuscript: Prof. Latib Rachida and Prof. Omor Youssef, Radiology Department of National Institute of Oncology, Ibn Sina hospital, Rabat, Morocco.\n\n【20】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【21】In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【26】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【27】Written informed consent for publication was obtained from patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.\n\n【28】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【29】Dr Yehouenou Tessi Romeo Thierry is acting as a guarantor of this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although calcium channel blockers are considered first-line drugs to prevent coronary vasospasm, they also have the potential to induce ST elevation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS. Therefore, the optimal medication for such a complicated case is still underdetermined. We report a male patient who presented with VF due to BrS, which was later found to have coexisted with coronary vasospasm. He was treated with low-dose bepridil expecting both its anti-arrhythmic and vasodilatory effects, but a later acetylcholine provocation test showed no suppression of vasospasm. Based on these results, we decided to add nitrates to the medication. This case report illustrates that drug selection needs caution in BrS when complicated with vasospastic angina and that bepridil monotherapy may not be sufficient to suppress coronary vasospasm in such cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Brugada syndrome (BrS) is one of the important causes of sudden cardiac death in young people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is known that 11–13% of BrS patients have intercurrent coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Although calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are considered first-line drugs to prevent coronary vasospasm, they also have the potential to induce ST elevation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Therefore, effective medical treatment for BrS with coronary vasospasm is still under debate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】The case is a 46-year-old male with a smoking history. Although he was pointed out to have a Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) in a past occupational medical health checkup, he was observed without further examination because of a lack of symptoms and family history. One day in the early morning, he lost consciousness at home, and an ambulance was called by his family. Upon the arrival of the emergency services, he was in cardiac arrest due to VF and was taken to our hospital after successful resuscitation for a VF with an automatic external defibrillator. In the emergency department, his ECG showed idioventricular rhythm with a heart rate of 110/min, and no obvious ST elevation was observed. The echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with normal wall motion and valvular function. The emergency coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis, and he was tentatively diagnosed with idiopathic VF and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He underwent target temperature management (35°C for 24 h) and regained consciousness 12 h after the rewarming without neurological deficit. The follow-up 12-lead ECG showed early repolarization, but a typical Brugada-type ECG was not observed . Considering the possibility of VF due to coronary vasospasm, we performed an acetylcholine provocation test on the fifth hospital day. No spasm occurred in the right coronary artery, but sub-occlusion was observed in the left anterior descending artery after administration of 50 μg and 100 μg of acetylcholine . On the other hand, he did not complain of chest symptoms and no significant changes in the ECG were observed during the spasm provocation. On the ninth hospital day, a pilsicainide administration test was performed. Immediately after the drug administration, ST-segment elevation with the right bundle branch block was observed in V1 and V2 . Based on these findings, he was diagnosed as VF due to BrS. He was implanted with a subcutaneous ICD on the 12th hospital day to prevent sudden cardiac death. He started taking bepridil at 100 mg/day to suppress VF recurrence and was discharged on the 16th hospital day. A month after discharge, an acetylcholine provocation test was performed once again to evaluate the efficacy of bepridil on the coronary vasospasm. As a result, the coronary spasm was induced by 50 μg of acetylcholine in both the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery . Based on this result, we decided to add nitrates to the medication. His subsequent course was uneventful and being followed up at the outpatient clinic on a regular basis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|ECGs at different time points.

Although bepridil is classified as CCB, it can also suppress multiple K channels including Ito, and the subsequent upregulation of Na channels is thought to suppress VF via increasing Na current 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Although CCB is the first choice for the treatment of vasospastic angina, there is a concern that suppression of inward Ca current in BrS may increase ventricular arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It has also been reported that K-channel opening drugs, known as vasodilators, induced coved-type ST elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition to the above-mentioned antiarrhythmic effect, bepridil has been reported to be safe and effective in stable angina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, we expected this drug to have an inhibitory effect on both coronary spasm and arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. However, in our case, the coronary spasm was not suppressed by bepridil monotherapy, but rather worsened in the second acetylcholine provocation test. Therefore, we decided to add nitrate to suppress coronary spasms, in accordance with precedent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Since nitrate tolerance can develop with long-term use, and the possible calcium channel blocking effects of nitrates have been pointed out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, their efficacy should be evaluated periodically.\n\n【11】Brugada phenocopies are clinical entities in which the diagnostic criteria for BrS are not fulfilled, but the Brugada-type ECG is induced by certain clinical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Previously, Itoh _et al_ . reported a case of vasospastic angina presenting Brugada-type ECG abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In their case, combination therapy with diltiazem and flecainide could suppress both anginal symptoms and syncope caused by VF. However, our case differs in that acetylcholine administration did not induce Brugada-type ECG or VF, nor did it provoke any chest symptoms.\n\n【12】One might surmise that the coronary spasm could not be suppressed due to the low dose of bepridil, but there was a concern about the dose-dependent QT-prolonging effect. Since it has been reported that low-dose bepridil is effective enough for BrS with SCN5A mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, we adopted 100 mg/day in this case. As drug options are limited in BrS with coronary spasms, further research is needed to clarify the true effects of bepridil.\n\n【13】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】None declared.\n\n【15】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【16】The case report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital.\n\n【17】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【18】Informed consent was obtained from the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is caused by a limited number of pathologies but can, in rare situations, be idiopathic. Its management is difficult and usually involves correcting the primary pathology, making idiopathic chylous ascites particularly difficult to manage. We present a case of idiopathic chylous ascites extensively investigated over a period of several years. An incidental finding of B cell lymphoma was initially suspected to have been the primary cause of the ascites; however, after successful treatment of this condition, the patient’s ascites did not resolve. Diagnostic difficulties and management are discussed and an overview of the diagnostic process is outlined through this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Chylous ascites is an uncommon finding in patients with abdominal distension. Incidence is 1 in 20 000 hospital admissions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is associated with malignancy, infections, cirrhosis, trauma or previous abdominal surgery. We present a case of idiopathic chylous ascites in a patient where all known causes of underlying pathology were excluded.\n\n【4】SUMMARY\n-------\n\n【5】A 72- year-old man was referred to the gastroenterology clinic due to abdominal distension, weight loss and change in bowel habit. He had no significant past medical history, previous trauma, risk factors for liver disease or abdominal surgery.\n\n【6】A computed tomogram (CT) chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed demonstrating a right-sided pleural effusion and large volume ascites . The liver, other abdominal viscera and lymph nodes appeared normal except for small simple liver and splenic cysts.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography demonstrating (a) large right-sided pleural effusion with surrounding atelectasis and (b) significant abdominal ascites with benign liver and splenic cysts.</u>\n\n【8】Both the pleural effusion and ascites were sampled—the aspirate appeared light pink and milky in color consistent with chyle. Analysis of the fluid revealed the presence of chylomicrons and raised levels of triglycerides (13.6 mmol/L) in keeping with chylous ascites. Fluid and serum LDH were normal and the serum-ascitic albumin gradient (SAAG) was 9 g/L, suggestive of an exudative process or malignancy rather than portal hypertension or heart failure. Fluid cytology revealed a small clonal B cell population (13% of total white cells; CD5-/CD10-/CD20+/CD23+) together with reactive T-cells, suggestive of possible low grade B-cell lymphoma. Myd88 mutation analysis was indeterminate. As part of work-up for lymphoma, bone marrow trephine biopsy and aspiration was performed and did not reveal evidence of malignancy. However, repeat sampling of the ascitic fluid returned clonal B-cells with identical phenotype. The working diagnosis was low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the patient was given first-line (Rituximab single agent) and then second-line (Bendamustine and Rituximab) treatment. Neither treatment resulted in the improvement of ascites, despite disappearance of the clonal B cells from the ascitic fluid. PET scans showed no evidence of FDG-avid disease on three separate occasions, with no radiological thickening of the pleura or peritoneum suggestive of non-FDG avid lymphomatous deposits.\n\n【9】Echocardiogram did not show evidence of heart failure, valvular pathology or constrictive pericarditis and blood tests were negative for autoimmune liver diseases, hepatitis B and C, HIV and TB. Transjugular liver biopsy failed due to inadvertent brachiocephalic artery puncture, so transgastric endoscopic ultrasound left lobe liver biopsy was performed and revealed normal hepatic tissue with no evidence of cirrhosis or inflammation. Lymphangiography was not performed but there was no history of prior thoracic trauma or external beam radiotherapy.\n\n【10】The patient was started on a low triglyceride diet by dietitians and continued to have regular paracentesis for symptomatic relief. In 2022, he was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (ascitic WCC 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). There was no perforation on plain radiography or CT imaging. Despite brief improvement with broad spectrum antibiotics, repeat ascitic fluid cultures returned multi-resistant _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus faecium_ . Despite high leukocytosis and mixed bacterial ascitic culture, repeat CT imaging demonstrated no viscus perforation or abscess, and the patient was started on nasogastric feeding and therapeutic paracentesis when symptomatic from tense ascites.\n\n【11】Despite regular paracentesis, there was rapid re-accumulation of ascites and further deterioration with splinting of the diaphragm and respiratory compromise. After further clinical deterioration, repeat CT scanning of the abdomen was performed which demonstrated pneumoperitoneum and a possible perforation and the hepatic flexure of the colon. Further ascitic cultures grew _Candida albicans_ and _E. faecium_ . The patient died as a result of acute peritonitis despite conservative medical management as he was not fit for surgical intervention. A post-mortem was not undertaken after the case was reviewed by the medical examiner as the cause of death was peritonitis secondary to bowel perforation.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Chylous ascites is rare and usually has a poor outcome due to its frequent association with malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Other contributing factors to morbidity are the loss of a large volume of fluid, calorie-rich lipids and protein in the ascitic fluid. The mainstay of treatment is management of the underlying cause, but as this case shows, this is not always possible when the underlying cause is not identified.\n\n【14】In such situations, symptomatic management is required. Changes in oral diet ensure reduction in lymph flow—low lipid and high medium chain triglyceride diets are the first step, but total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be started if adapted diets fail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed and transported to the liver as free fatty acids and glycerol, while long-chain triglycerides are converted to chylomicrons, thereby increasing lymph production. TPN may be used in selected cases when enteral diet has failed to improve ascites, as reduction in enteral feeding can result in reduction of lymph flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Both somatostatin and its analogues use have been reported in literature. The mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to reduce portal pressure and decrease peristalsis, leading to a reduced absorption of triglycerides into the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. This treatment was not used in our case.\n\n【16】Repeated therapeutic paracentesis or indwelling shunts (e.g. peritoneal-venous ‘Denver’ shunts) may be performed for symptomatic relief, but this comes with the added risk of infection or shunt occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. No previous studies have identified or postulated whether chylous ascites increases the risk of secondary bacterial peritonitis, or whether this is more likely a secondary complication of repeated ascitic drainage, but chronic loss of chyle does result in immune system compromise and malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is therefore crucial to involve dietitians as part of a multidisciplinary approach to management to ensure adequate calorie intake.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received or required in this case.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no ethical approval required in this case.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary materials.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Suresh V.

Due to its rarity, interventionalists are less likely to be acquainted with angiography in this unique population. In the case of lesion ambiguity, different invasive diagnostic tools can be used to further evaluate lesion severity, including fractional flow reserve, instantaneous wave-free ratio and intravenous ultrasound (IVUS). In this case, we discuss the usefulness of IVUS as a beneficial tool in evaluation of angiographically ambiguous lesions due to foreshortening. Dextrocardia presents unique challenges to the interventional cardiologist secondary to difficulty in acquiring adequate views and unfamiliarity with mirroring of anatomy, and thus angiography can result in inaccurately assessed lesions. We demonstrate how IVUS can be used in evaluation of such lesions for more accurate evaluation, precision in stent placement and in turn better patient outcomes.\n\n【2】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【3】A 71-year-old male with past medical history of complete situs inversus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, bilateral pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and self-reported ‘heart aneurysm’ was admitted to the hospital with crushing right-sided chest pain radiating into the neck beginning that morning, with accompanying palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness and hand numbness. He denied any prior history of coronary artery disease. Family history is significant for aortic aneurysm in his mother, who died of aneu-rysm-related complications at age 57. The patient had a 65-pack year smoking history. He was not taking anticoagulants at the time of admission. Electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block (RBBB), rate 71 beats per minute (bpm), QRS 136 milliseconds (ms), corrected QT (QTc) 491 ms, normal axis and no ischemia . Repeat EKG also exhibited RBBB, QRS 134 ms with T wave abnormalities, rate 75 bpm and QTc 482 ms . Computed tomography angiography chest with and without contrast showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or active disease. Troponins were positive, and rose from initial 0.06 to 2.766 maximum, then decreased to 2.167 over admission. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle cavity size with ejection fraction 50–55%, no wall motion abnormalities, and mild–moderate aortic valve regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed the day following admission. Approach involved a modified Seldinger technique and right femoral access as the brachial artery was too narrow. An ambiguous lesion of the right coronary artery (RCA) was seen on right anterior oblique (RAO) view, as seen in video 1 , and subsequently investigated using intravenous ultrasound technology (IVUS) . IVUS was chosen for its unique ability to provide real-time views of the intraluminal space allowing for better assessment of disease burden than angiography alone in intermediate and ambiguous lesions. The lesion was found to be an 80–90% occluded napkin-ring lesion of the proximal RCA. Video 2 demonstrates how the views were adjusted to account for mirroring, after which the lesion could be better appreciated . Without the use of IVUS, the lesion could have otherwise been underappreciated due to foreshortening secondary to unique anatomy of dextrocardia. PCI was performed using a 4.5 × 15 mm drug-eluting stent, and the patient was subsequently started on triple therapy consisting of apixaban, aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Initial EKG 08.08.2021; initial EKG demonstrating sinus rhythm, QRS 136 ms, rate 71 bpm, QTC 491 ms, normal axis and no ischemia.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Follow-up EKG 08.10.2021; repeat EKG demonstrating right bundle branch block, QRS 134 ms, T wave abnormalities, rate 75 bpm and QTc 482 ms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|RAO view of RCA showing ambiguity; RAO view of the right coronary artery showing intermediate lesion (black arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|IVUS view of RCA lesion; IVUS imaging of the RCA lesion demonstrating plaque morphology and stenosis of 80–90%.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|RAO view with caudal angulation showing napkin ring lesion; adjusted RAO view with caudal angulation demonstrating extent of napkin-ring lesion of the RCA (black arrow).</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Situs inversus totalis, or situs inversus with dextrocardia, is a rare anomaly in which the internal organs are transposed oppositely as mirror images. It is believed these individuals have similar risk of coronary artery disease as the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The first report of coronary angiography in dextrocardia was in 1974, and the first report of PCI dextrocardia was in 1987 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Reports on PCI in this population have been limited, likely due to the low incidence of the disorder (1/10 000) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It can be difficult to identify myocardial infarcts in these patients, especially if dextrocardia presence is unknown, as presenting complaint may be right-sided chest pain with possible radiation to the right shoulder and arm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. EKG interpretation can also be misleading if dextrocardia is unknown at time of test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Guidelines for intervention are the same as in non-dextrocardia patients, but the operator must take into account the unique anatomical challenge that comes with transposition of the heart and coronaries to ensure optimal benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Coronary angiography is the gold standard to assess coronary stenosis. A stenotic diameter of >70% in non-left main artery (LMA) disease and _\\>_ 50% for LMA disease has been the standard for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Intermediate stenosis, defined as visual angiographic diameter stenosis severity between 40 and 69% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, creates a challenging question for the operator: is intervention warranted? The most recent guidelines of the American College of Cardiology support the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as invasive methods to assess the hemodynamic significance of intermediate lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. IVUS is an alternative intraprocedural diagnostic modality to evaluate such lesions. IVUS displays real-time views on plaque morphology providing valuable information on lesion severity as well as for stent placement and sizing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. IVUS’s cross-sectional intraluminal view provides significant advantage in assessment of ambiguous lesions when compared to the 2D x-ray projection of angiograms alone, and has been shown to yield superior outcomes, i.e. a decrease in incidence of under-expansion and incomplete apposition to the vessel wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In situs inversus, IVUS can be particularly useful, especially when the operator is unaccustomed to seeing reverse imaging of the heart and taking into consideration the anatomical issues that can present in ways such as lesion foreshortening.\n\n【12】Review of literature shows differing suggestions on angles for optimum viewing based on which vessel requires intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. Although our focus emphasizes the helpful use of technology for intermediate lesions in populations with unique anatomy such as dextrocardia, it is important to point out the differences in angiographic views. We comprehensively illustrate the vessel views in standard and mirrored form in Figs 6 and 7 . Note each angiographic camera angle is the same for discerning each respective portion of a coronary artery, the only difference being the views are mirror images of each other necessitating directionally opposite torquing for cannulation. For example, the catheter points toward the left side of the screen instead of the right when engaging the left coronary ostium in the left anterior oblique (LAO) view. The catheter points to the right side of screen instead of left side when engaging the RCA ostium in the LAO view. Standard catheters can be used, but manipulation must be in opposite direction for optimal management, i.e. counterclockwise rotation of catheter for RCA cannulation as compared to the standard clockwise rotation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Left coronary system angiography views: angiography views of left coronary tree: standard views are the angiographic views that would be seen in a patient with an anatomically standard position of the heart, on the anatomical left side of the thoracic cavity; dextrocardia views are those seen on angiography in a patient with dextrocardia, where the heart is on the anatomical right side of the thoracic cavity.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|Right coronary system angiography views: angiography views of right coronary tree: standard views are the angiographic views that would be seen in a patient with an anatomically standard position of the heart, on the anatomical left side of the thoracic cavity; dextrocardia views are those seen on angiography in a patient with dextrocardia, with their heart on the anatomical right side of the thoracic cavity.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thomas Vacek provided contributions in concept and outline design, knowledge of angiographical views, expert guidance in figure editing for accuracy, and approved final draft of manuscript.

Clinical suspicion and prompt treatment are necessary to avoid permanent disfigurement, progression to systemic involvement and poor quality of life. We report a case of delayed DLE diagnosis in a 45-year-old man who presented with a new skin lesion mimicking the early stages of mycosis fungoides that prompted further investigation. Histopathological examination confirmed DLE and appropriate treatment was initiated. However, the atypical clinical presentation led to disseminated DLE and refractory disease control, resulting in scarring and cosmetic disfigurement.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an autoimmune disease existing on a spectrum of cutaneous and systemic manifestations. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the most common variant of chronic cutaneous LE that can present in a variety of morphologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Understanding atypical DLE presentations can aid in early diagnosis and prompt treatment. A clinical diagnosis can only be made with high clinical suspicion and confirmed with histopathological examination.

Thus, understanding clinical variations in cutaneous presentations of LE can aid in early clinical and confirmatory histopathological diagnosis.

The new skin lesion on the left upper chest had raised dusky, violaceous and erythematous borders with central clearing and overlying scaly crusts . Erythematous plaques were present behind both ears bilaterally . No sensory loss was elicited over the lesions. They were non-painful and non-pruritic. He did not have any systemic symptoms.

There was a dense superficial dermal lichenoid-type of lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with scattered melanophages and presence of colloid bodies . Marked perieccrine chronic inflammation was noted, extending into the deep dermis. Minimal interstitial chronic inflammation, along with dermal mucin, was present . Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. Antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro were positive with speckled titer pattern. Normal urine protein. Differential diagnosis included MF, other lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, tuberculoid leprosy and DLE.\n\n【9】Histopathological findings coupled with serological findings were corroborative of DLE and thus the patient was started on short-term oral steroids with prednisolone (20 mg daily), oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (200 mg, twice daily) and high-potency topical steroid clobetasol propionate. Treatment included photoprotection recommendations.\n\n【10】At a 6-week follow-up, new cutaneous lesions appeared on the back  and the upper chest lesion became infiltrative . The new lesions indicated active disease, and the secondary steroid-sparing immunosuppressant methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg was started with folic acid 5 mg weekly. The patient had weight loss and fatigue, and his daily activities were difficult. In addition, avoidance of sun exposure was challenging due to his occupation and non-adherence to sun protective measures. At 12 weeks, due to the persistence of new lesions, MTX was increased to 20 mg weekly and combined with intralesional corticosteroids with triamcinolone acentonide (40 mg diluted in normal saline and xylocaine 1%, 1:2:1) injected into all cutaneous lesions on the body. The upper chest lesion exhibited signs of healing with presence of residual scar tissue . The patient was experiencing discomfort and pain in all new cutaneous lesions.\n\n【11】Patient’s systemic evaluation was negative to date. The patient is under regular follow-up with dermatology and rheumatology.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】DLE renders difficulty in clinical suspicion and definitive diagnosis as skin lesions resemble common dermatoses. It can lead to permanent disfigurement with hair loss, dyspigmentation and scarring if not treated early or adequately controlled. The chronic nature of the disease imposes a psychological burden and high morbidity on patients, often requiring psychosocial support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion, and the diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology. Progression to systemic LE differs by subtype, which is higher in generalized DLE (15–28%) than localized DLE (5–10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. DLE was reported in the literature to mimic a number of diseases including polymorphic light eruption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, tinea faciei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, vitiligo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and lupus vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis and treatment remain key to preventing detrimental patient outcomes. In our case, the appearance of a new scaly erythematous plaque in a photoprotected area with hyperpigmented borders, mimicking the patch- or plaque-stage of MF, prompted histopathological evaluation that confirmed DLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient was started on oral steroids, oral HCQ 200 mg twice daily along with high potency topical steroids. The initial misdiagnosis and delayed initiation of DLE treatment resulted in poor disease control, and second-line oral MTX 15 mg weekly with folic acid 5 mg was added and increased to 20 mg weekly due to progressively new skin lesions. Intralesional steroid injections were added as an alternative local therapy. This patient’s progression to generalized DLE increases the risk of systemic involvement. Multiple treatment modalities were initiated in effort to control the appearance of new skin lesions and further disfigurement. In other cases of insufficient response to HCQ, a cohort of patients showed response to chloroquine or even combination therapy. However, no new lesions appeared and infiltrative lesions showed gradual improvement on subsequent follow-up, healing with surrounding hyperpigmentation and central scarring, hypopigmentation and atrophy. To avoid detrimental sequelae of DLE, early diagnostic evaluation with histopathological examination and prompt treatment is necessary to halt progression of disease towards permanent disfigurement and progression to systemic LE.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thanks to MRC, Hamad Medical Corporation and all the healthcare professionals who participated in the care of this case.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The publication of this article was funded by the Qatar National Library.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed for this case report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient in this manuscript has given written informed consent to publication of their case details.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Hanof Ahmed is the corresponding author and guarantor of this article.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n---------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data resulted from this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms had developed over the previous 6 days. The patient’s medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary disease and hyperlipidemia. Physical examination did not identify any pathological finding. Routine laboratory examinations confirmed increased inflammatory markers (white blood cells: 10 300/μl, C-Reacting Protein: 22 mg/l) and a biliary obstruction pattern (total bilirubin: 1 mg/l, alkaline phosphatase: 123 IU/l, γ-GT: 456 IU/l, amylase: 178 IU/l and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase: 51/110 IU/l). Ultrasonography revealed dilation of the common bile duct, without, though, any stones within the gallbladder. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation.\n\n【10】A pancreatic protocol computer tomography scan was conducted the next day and revealed both intrahepatic and extrahepatic dilations. The gallbladder was normal without lithiasis, and the common bile duct measured at 18.4 mm. Before the ampulla of Vater, a low attenuation mass with a marked enhancement with a maximum diameter of 9 mm was identified . In addition, all tumor markers were within normal ranges.

The patient remained asymptomatic 3 months later and an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was arranged.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Gallstones may pass into the GI tract spontaneously through the common bile duct, particularly if the stone size is <3.5 mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, a stone can also pass through a biliary-enteric fistula, a complication seen in 0.3–1.5% of all patients with cholelithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In such a case, stones can obstruct the bowel lumen, thus resulting to a gallstone ileus. In our case, a 9-mm stone obstructed the final part of the biliary tract and passed through, without the presence of a fistula or a previous sphincterotomy. Moreover, another interesting characteristic was that initial imaging diagnosis was consistent with an intraductal mass.\n\n【18】CT pancreatography is now the gold standard protocol for pancreatico-biliary malignancies, with a sensitivity of 72–78% for the detection of biliary stones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Similarly to our case, biliary stones may be visible in a CT as hyperattenuating lesions surrounded by hypoattenuating bile and ampullary soft tissue. Moreover, distal choledocholithiasis may cause papillitis, with radiographic findings of bile duct obstruction at the papilla demonstrated by smooth and symmetric papillary edema, as presence of soft tissue, and contrast enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The differential diagnoses between benign and malignant conditions in the ampulla and periampullary region are difficult to assess radiologically as many imaging features are overlapping. Papillary size of less than 12.3 mm was identified as the only independent variable differentiating benign from malignant causes of papillary stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The vomiting of gallstones without the presence of a biliary-enteric fistula is extremely rare. To date, only two other cases have been reported in the literature. The first case occurred in 1951 and involved a 65-year-old female vomiting a 0.5-cm facetted gallstone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The second case was reported in 2013 and involved an 83-year-old female. The patient experienced multiple episodes of vomiting gallstones, secondary to an inflammatory stricture causing obstruction without the presence of a cholecysto-duodenal fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】To the best of our knowledge, including the present patient, only three cases of vomiting a gallstone, without the presence of a biliary-enteric fistula, have been reported in the literature. Besides these, the complexity of our case was further enhanced by the fact that preliminary reports were consistent with an intraductal neoplasia, thus complicating initial diagnostic approach. Moreover, no other risk factor for a retrograde flow of the gallstones into the stomach was identified. Despite the remarkable size of the stone, the pathology was self-resolved without any complication, thus avoiding an emergency operative management.\n\n【21】Herein, we presented the extremely rare case of a patient presenting with biliary obstruction due to a gallstone mimicking an intraductal tumor. Despite the lack of a biliaro-enteric fistula, the stone passed and was vomited, resulting to the amelioration of symptoms.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】There was non-financial support for this work.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Konstantinos Tepetes, Professor of Surgery University of Thessaly.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PATIENT CONSENT FORM\n--------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has signed a consent form for the publication of his medical record, with respect to his privacy.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Some of the circumstances that make identification more complex are bundle branch block patterns.

We present a patient with anteroseptal ST-segment elevation (STEMI), total AV block (TAVB) with ventricular escape rhythm RBBB pattern, and then turned into a LBBB pattern. Fortunately, it immediately turned into sinus rhythm after reperfusion therapy. It is essential to be able to identify STEMI in patients with BBB patterns.

Electrocardiography (ECG) is the fastest bedside tool to help identify it, but ECG is not without its limitations. Some conditions that make identification more complex are bundle branch block patterns such as left or right bundle branch block (LBBB/RBBB) or ventricular escape rhythm. ST elevation in RBBB can still be detected, but LBBB must use specific criteria such as Sgarbossa and Barcelona. These criteria are essential because an ECG of a patient with LBBB can show changes in the ST segment (elevation or depression) even though the patient does not have ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In this case, we report exciting points of ECG learning. The patient experienced acute anteroseptal STEMI, total AV block (TAVB) with escape ventricular rhythm RBBB morphology, then LBBB morphology, and returned to sinus rhythm immediately after reperfusion.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A man in his late 40s was referred to our emergency department (ED) for reperfusion. Six hours prior to his previous hospitalization, he had sudden, persistent chest pain (pain rating of 5/10), diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Total AV block with RBBB pattern escape rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads (V1–V4) were observed on an ECG from the previous hospital . Due to his unstable hemodynamic and severe bradycardia, he was given a 5 μg/min epinephrine infusion. At our ED, he was still experiencing chest pain (pain scale 4/10) with an onset time of 10 hours, stable hemodynamics with vasoactive support and the same ECG pattern. While waiting for an RT-PCR COVID-19 swab test (pandemic era), a percutaneous attachment temporary pacemaker (TPM) and thrombolytic strategy were implemented. A post-thrombolytic ECG revealed a total AV block with LBBB pattern escape rhythm . Alterations in hemodynamics, such as a decrease in hemodynamic status followed by a sign of shock, coincide with the ECG changes. As soon as negative COVID-19 screening result was obtained, the patient was immediately transferred to the Cath Lab for rescue PCI and transvenous pacemaker placement. The coronary angiography revealed that the right coronary arteries (RCAs) and left anterior descendent (LAD) had critical stenosis (99%) in the middle , and the LAD had significant stenosis (80%) in the distal . A cardiac arrest episode occurred during RCA’s angiography, and we immediately did cardiopulmonary resuscitation for less than 3 minutes. After the patient had regained spontaneous circulation, we decided to finish the reperfusion by opening the RCA and LAD segment. Each sirolimus eluting stent (SES) was successfully placed in the osteal-mid RCA with two overlapping SES, and the proximal-mid LAD with two overlapping SES in order to achieve TIMI Flow III. After the procedure, the ECG with the pacemaker on standby showed a return of the TAVB with RBBB pattern . After 24 hours post revascularization, the patient’s ECG changed significantly to sinus rhythm and normal axis without any intraventricular block . We removed the TPM on the second day of hospitalization. He was discharged after the seventh day of hospitalization.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The patient’s ECG at the previous hospital showed total AV block with RBBB pattern escape rhythm, and ST-segment elevation in anteroseptal leads (V1–V4).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The patient’s post-thrombolytic ECG showed total AV block with LBBB pattern escape rhythm.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Diagnostic coronary angiography (DCA) showed that the right coronary arteries (RCAs) had critical stenosis 99% in the middle segment.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|DCA showed LAD with critical stenosis of 99% in the middle segment and significant stenosis of 80% in the distal segment.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Patient’s ECG after successfully performing complete revascularization procedure and installing a temporary pacemaker.

Ninety percent of patients with nodal, supra-Hisian or lesions above the bundle of His have occlusion of the RCA segment or inferior myocardial wall. The escape rhythm manifested in these lesions exhibits a narrow QRS complex, either reversible or transient, and the patient is expected to recover within a week. Patients with this ailment typically have asymptomatic bradycardia (40–60 beats per minute) and low mortality risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In comparison, intranodal or infra-Hisian lesions (distal to the AV node) are associated with occlusion in the LAD segment or anterior wall of the myocardium. This lesion manifests an escape rhythm characterized by a wide QRS complex and occurs within 24 hours. The development of a new BBB at this lesion suggests a significant anterior infarction with an extremely high mortality rate (80%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition, TAVB due to acute LAD occlusion will provide BBB/hemiblock pattern to describe the extent of MI. As in our case, the ventricular escape rhythm that appears had a RBBB pattern initially. Although the existence of RBBB may confound the diagnosis of STEMI, it is not too difficult to diagnose. Immediately after thrombolysis, the ECG changed to LBBB ventricular escape rhythm pattern. Interestingly, additional ECG observations revealed that it did not meet the diagnostic criteria for STEMI in LBBB. Sgarbossa _et al_ . have three criteria for diagnosis of acute MI with LBBB: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> ST-segment, elevation ≥1 mm in any lead with positive QRS (V4, V5, V6, Lead 1 and AVL); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> ST-segment depression ≥1 mm in V1, V2, and V3 and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ST-segment elevation ≥5 mm in any lead with discordant QRS (V1, V2, V3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Several case reports have also reported alternating BBB. This may be related to variances in the origin of ventricular impulses and the duration of the conduction branch refractory periods during the R-R interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Treatment for patients with electrical instability due to bundle branch block is TPM placement, and for patients with cardiogenic shock due to coronary artery occlusion is reperfusion. These two procedures are the cornerstone of treatment for patients diagnosed with STEMI and BBB. After undergoing these two main procedures, the patient’s clinical and hemodynamic status continued to improve. On the second day of the patient’s hospitalization, there was an improvement in heart rhythm to sinus rhythm with narrow QRS and thus no longer a BBB pattern. However, ST-segment elevation was still seen in leads V1-V5 of the patient’s ECG. As the patient’s hemodynamics improved, vasoactive support was no longer needed. Furthermore, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the seventh day of the hospitalization with oral therapy including high-intensity statins and dual antiplatelet drugs. The patient planned a monthly follow-up at the outpatient clinic for further monitoring.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank all Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine Airlangga University colleagues for their support.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding to report for this case report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report and any accompanying images.

He complained of repetitive episodes of fast tachycardia, some accompanied with dizziness.\n\n【2】When the ectopic discharge was slow, no clear-cut difference between the sinus rate and the ectopic rate was seen and thus the atrial rhythm appeared quite regular. The ectopic focus was situated deep inside the right upper pulmonary vein (RSPV).\n\n【3】After RSPV isolation a persistent sinus rhythm was established and since then the patient has been asymptomatic for 3 years.\n\n【4】Thus, subtle changes in the P wave morphology without a significant change in the heart rate in patients presenting with palpitations can give a clue to the diagnosis of the tachycardia and the localization of the ectopic focus.\n\n【5】cardiac electrophysiology\n\n【6】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【7】Subtle changes in the P wave polarity combined with slight changes in the heart rate are often considered to represent a shift of the origin of the impulse within the sinus node itself.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 22-year-old man was referred to us for drug resistant atrial tachycardia during exercise since 4–5 years. The rate of the tachycardia had been measured up to 250 bpm inducing marked dizziness. Slower ectopic rhythms around 100 bpm were also recorded. Various degrees of atrioventricular block could also be seen during tachycardia. The patient was initially treated with flecainide 100 mg bid but since 3–4 months the tachycardia recurred many times a week lasting from 1 minute to a couple of hours. There was no past medical history. Physical examination was normal. The echocardiogram was normal, too.\n\n【10】An electrophysiological study was performed.\n\n【11】Initially, only supraventricular premature beats were seen. Compared with sinus rhythm, there was a slight reduction in the amplitude of the positive P in Lead 1, the P waves were more positive in Lead 2, Lead 3, AVF, the P waves were inverted in AVL compared with sinus rhythm and there was a change in polarity of the P wave in V1 from biphasic positive negative to positive .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) One atrial premature beat (APD) shows a slight reduction of the positive P wave amplitude in Lead 1, increase of the positivity in Lead 1, Lead 3, AVF, negativation of the P wave in AVL and positivation in V1 compared with sinus rhythm.

Two morphologies of P waves can be seen. One (E) is similar to the ectopic rhythm recorded during the fast tachycardia and the premature atrial beats. One sinus beat can also be seen (S).</u>\n\n【16】Intracardiac measurements showed that during the premature beats and the tachycardia the high right atrium and the coronary sinus os were activated simultaneously and that the lateral wall of the right atrium was late.\n\n【17】At that point of time, the differential diagnosis based on right atrial mapping was: a focus in the right interatrial septum, a focus in the non-coronary aortic cusp, a focus in the left interatrial septum, a focus in the right upper pulmonary vein. The earliest atrial activation during the arrhythmia was found in the high right septal area with a prematurity of minus 30 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave. Pacing at that site was the best site to reproduce closely the timing and the morphology of the right intra atrial and coronary sinus electrograms during the arrhythmia.\n\n【18】One radiofrequency application at that site was unsuccessful. The left atrium was accessed via transseptal puncture. A Biosense Lasso catheter was positioned in the right superior pulmonary vein (RPSV) as well as a Biosense Thermocool Smarttouch D curve ablation catheter. These catheters were connected to a 3D electroanatomical system (Carto3, Biosense Webster, USA).\n\n【19】After placement of the Lasso in the RSPV, at the antero–inferior part of the Lasso (electrodes 7–10), small fragmented potentials with a prematurity of minus 100 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave during extrasystoles were seen. There was also an inversion of the normal sequence of RPSV activation: the venous potential preceded the far field atrial potential on the premature beats , demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The Lasso catheter (PV1–2 = > 9–10) is positioned at the ostium of the right superior pulmonary vein.

The ectopic beat shows an inversion of the sequence of activation (PV precedes A) with fragmented PV potentials (PV 7–10) preceding the far field atrial potentials (A) and the beginning of the P wave by 100 ms and also preceding the other PV potentials recorded by the Lasso catheter demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin of the ectopy.</u>\n\n【21】We could also see an alternation of sinus rhythm and RPSV regular atrial rhythm around 43 bpm with inversion of the normal sequence of activation of the pulmonary vein on the abnormal beats .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|A regular atrial rhythm at 43 bpm is seen.

After isolation was completed, a slow irregular dissociated rhythm with a cycle length between 380 and 680 ms was visible inside the vein. Mapping the dissociated rhythm within the RSPV with the ablation catheter showed fragmented potentials preceding the earliest Lasso activation by 35 ms. These were recorded a few centimeters inside the vein, beyond the right heart radiologic border.\n\n【24】During a 24 hour follow-up only the typical sinus node atrial activation could be seen.\n\n【25】The patient remains asymptomatic after a follow-up of 3 years.\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【27】This case report demonstrates that ectopy coming from the RPSV may cause rapid tachycardia but may also be responsible for very slow stable atrial ectopic atrial rhythm mimicking sinus rhythm. Pulmonary vein tachycardia has been shown to be associated with slow and fast ventricular rhythms in a limited number of cases. In some cases, it is, as in our case, due to slow and fast firing of the ectopic focus (3 cases described) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. In two of them however the focus was situated in the left superior pulmonary vein. In some cases permanent rapid pulmonary venous firing mimicking sinus tachycardia caused heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】As far as the polarity of the ectopic P wave is concerned, it was in accordance with the RSPV localization suggested by Yamane _et al._ in their study on pulmonary venous pacing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Kistler _et al._ found in 27 cases that in the case of pulmonary venous ectopy 39% of the ectopic rhythms were coming from the RSPV and 39% from the left superior pulmonary vein. They also found that 93% of the pulmonary venous foci were ostial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This was not the case in our patient where the focus was situated inside the vein.\n\n【30】The main take home message is the following: changes in the polarity of the P waves, even subtle, despite a slow regular atrial rhythm should raise attention in patients complaining of paroxysmal tachycardia and could be a clue to the presence of an ectopic focus responsible for the complaints.\n\n【31】The polarity of the P wave may help in localizing the origin of the focus.\n\n【32】This also illustrates the ability of the RPSV to generate very slow or very fast ectopic rhythms in the same patient.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.

This can result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the location of the embolism. The risks and benefits of closure of small PFOs have not been well elucidated in prior studies. We describe a patient with a history of Factor V Leiden heterozygosity who presented with left arm pain secondary to arterial embolism. The patient was a 51-year-old male who initially presented to the emergency department after awaking from sleep with progressive, severe, burning left arm pain. He had also noted intermittent shortness of breath over the 2 weeks prior to admission. Temperature was 97.4 F, pulse 86, respiratory rate 20 and blood pressure 121/87. Oxygen saturation was 94% on supplemental oxygen. He had a cool left upper extremity and the patient described subjective paresthesias in this extremity. Left radial pulse was difficult to palpate. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.217 ng/l. White blood cell count was 11.8 and INR 1.1. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific T abnormalities in the anterior leads. His past medical history was notable for only hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke; there is currently no absolute indication for closure device. We describe the case of a 51-year-old male who had presented with left arm pain and shortness of breath. The computed tomography (CT) angiography of chest showed pulmonary emboli with heavy clot burden bilaterally. Heparin was started, but patient was found to have occlusion along large arteries of the left arm. Emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia were performed. The transthoracic echocardiogram done the next day with bubble study was positive for patent foramen ovale. Hypercoaguability showed factor V Leiden heterozygosity. Decision was made for the patient to initiate long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and closure was performed. Patient was advised that closure is off label but opted to proceed with closure in light of hypercoaguable state.\n\n【2】Chest X-ray did not show any process that could explain the acute hypoxic episode and patient sounded clear on lung exam. Hence, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest was performed with higher suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT angiography showed multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and left main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally . Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done showing ejection fraction of 65% and severely elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 72 mmHg . There was no free-floating cardiac thrombi detected, and echo did not show concomitant septal flattening; moreover, McConnell’s sign was not present Workup thus far was discussed with pulmonology and the patient was not felt to be a candidate for thrombectomy since he was not showing hemodynamic instability characteristic of massive PE, so therapeutic heparin drip was initiated and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for submassive PE.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest was done showing multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally.

It was initially thought that the pain was musculoskeletal in nature; however, after discovery of multiple coagulation events, prospect for embolism was endorsed. He was sent for ultrasound of upper and lower extremities. Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities revealed acute deep venous thrombosis within the left posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Venous ultrasound of the upper extremities showed no evidence of clot. Arterial ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the left proximal to mid-brachial artery with reconstitution of flow at the level of the distal brachial artery. Vascular surgery was consulted and the patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia and sample of clot is shown.</u>\n\n【7】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【8】A repeat TTE was done the next day and bubble study was positive for a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted regarding the need for open heart surgery versus percutaneous closure of the PFO. It was decided that the patient initiate long-term anticoagulation and that percutaneous closure could be performed at a later date. Hematology was consulted and the patient underwent a hypercoagulability workup which later was remarkable for Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. The patient opted for treatment with rivaroxaban over warfarin, and therefore rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily was started with plans to adjust dosing to 20 mg daily in three weeks. Another TTE was done on admission Day 3 showing improvement of pulmonary artery systolic pressure with RVSP of 46 mmHg. Pulmonology recommended against inferior vena cava filter placement as patient had rapid clinical improvement with systemic anticoagulation. After 2 more days of observation and treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital with plans for outpatient follow-up.\n\n【9】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n---------------------\n\n【10】One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study . During outpatient cardiology follow-up, there was a discussion with the patient regarding the very large PFO/atrial septal defect (ASD) and his high risk of further embolic event. He was advised that closure is off-label and that the latest trials did not show superiority with closure versus anticoagulation. Given his high risk of embolic event, and because he was a scuba diver with increased risk for the decompression sickness, he opted to proceed with closure.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with TEE showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study.</u>\n\n【12】Three weeks later, patient underwent percutaneous closure of the PFO with intraoperative fluoroscopy guidance. A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device . This device consists of two disks, the first deployed on the left side of the PFO and then the second along the right side of the PFO. Placement was confirmed by TEE . Patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and plavix for 3 months and advised to continue systemic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6:|删除段之间换行|Placement was confirmed by TEE showing negative bubble study.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This patient was found to have a hypercoagulable state from Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. This predisposed him to the development of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and large bilateral PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The development of arterial embolus to the left arm was made possible by a large PFO and has been cited several times in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Paradoxical arterial embolism has been associated with PFO, atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), and ostium secundum ASD. Recommended therapy differs depending on the type of anomaly present and its characteristics that can predispose the patient to increased risk of arterial embolism events. PFO occurs in 25–30% of the general population. It is thought to be an innocent bystander in many patients with stroke; however, in the younger population (<55 years of age), it could be the underlying etiology for recurrent arterial embolus events, such as cryptogenic stroke or peripheral embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Currently, the usefulness of percutaneous closure of PFO versus surgical closure or medical therapy alone remains unclear. Further complicating factors to decide on treatment include hypercoaguable states that were not part of inclusion criteria when evaluating for efficacy. The current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Three studies (CLOSURE I trial, PC trial and RESPECT trial) have failed to demonstrate that percutaneous PFO closure relates significant reduction in primary endpoint (stroke, TIA, peripheral embolism, etc.) outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. However, extended data from the RESPECT trial after 10 years have shown some benefit to closure with 54% relative risk reduction for recurrent cryptogenic stroke versus those assigned to medical management of anticoagulation. Moreover, two more recent trials have shown some benefit to closure of PFO closure with aspirin in those with a true cryptogenic stroke: REDUCE and CLOSE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Additional randomized trial data are still needed to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous PFO closure as compared to other treatment modalities before considering a widespread use.\n\n【19】LEARNING POINTS\n---------------\n\n【20】In summary, paradoxical arterial embolism via PFO should be determined to be a possibility in a patient presenting with deep venous thrombosis and/or PE who also have evidence of an arterial embolic event. Testing may include CT angiogram, venous/arterial ultrasound and echocardiography with bubble study. Treatment options include systemic anticoagulation, IVC filter placement, percutaneous closure of PFO, surgical closure of PFO or no closure of PFO depending on the patient’s presentation, history, and consideration of indications/contraindications. Pending further randomized trial data, percutaneous PFO closure may be considered as for prevention of paradoxical arterial embolism.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe a case of convulsions resulting from a single dose of nalidixic acid in a previously healthy two-month-old child in Northern Iraq who was being treated for a diarrhoeal illness. The child presented to us with new onset seizures, irritability, and acidaemia. Nalidixic acid was thought to be responsible after the exclusion of other potential causes of seizures. Symptoms resolved by treatment with intravenous (IV) diazepam, and cessation of nalidixic acid, and the child recovered fully and was discharged home neurologically intact after two days of observation. In regions where it is commonly prescribed, such as Northern Iraq, nalidixic acid should be considered as a cause of convulsions in any seizing child who has been exposed to the drug. Furthermore, quinolones such as nalidixic acid are contraindicated in children < 3 months of age.\n\n【2】nalidixic acid , idiopathic intracranial hypertension , infantile diarrhoea , dysentery , case report , humanitarian and resource-limited setting (HRLS)\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】A 2-month-old boy presented to our Emergency Room (ER) with convulsions and abnormal cry. His mother also noticed apnoeic episodes prior to arrival. The infant had a history of 3 days of non-bloody diarrhoea. No vomiting, fever, rash, coughing or respiratory distress were reported. The child was exclusively breastfed and had been feeding well prior to his illness. He had been seen by a community healthcare practitioner who prescribed simethicone, and nalidixic acid 55 mg/kg/day, and was administered one dose of each drug that morning ~2 hours before presentation. The nalidixic acid was in the form of a 250 mg/5 ml suspension for oral use. His mother reported that she followed the dosing instructions and did not administer any extra of either drug, although it was unclear what exact dose she gave as she did not have the dosage spoon with her. An overdose of nalidixic acid was certainly possible if the full 55 mg/kg/day was given in a single dose, as it is typically recommended to be administered in four equally divided doses.\n\n【5】Of note, in our Humanitarian and Resource-Limited Setting (HRLS) in post-conflict Northern Iraq, primary healthcare is limited, and the gap has been filled by practitioners who may be operating outside their usual scope of practice. Inappropriate drug prescription is a common occurrence, and children may be prescribed antibiotics empirically for what in most cases is viral gastroenteritis.\n\n【6】PATIENT INFORMATION\n-------------------\n\n【7】The infant was born at full term by uncomplicated vaginal delivery 2 months previously at our hospital. He had been developing normally since birth. There was no known family history of seizure disorders, and no maternal illnesses or congenitally transmitted infections were reported during the pregnancy.\n\n【8】CLINICAL FINDINGS\n-----------------\n\n【9】The child’s weight and vital signs upon arrival are presented in Fig. 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Vital signs upon presentation.</u>\n\n【11】Initial assessment revealed a well-developed but mildly dehydrated infant with abnormal cry. His anterior fontanelle had subtle bulging. He had tachypnoea and efforts suggestive of acidotic breathing, and he was making sounds that resembled grunting. The child was not responding appropriately to stimulation, and his gaze was deviated to the left. His pupils were 1 mm and sluggish. He had some repetitive puckering of his lips, plus rhythmic jerking motions of his right arm and leg, similar to those seen earlier by his mother. All four limbs appeared to periodically stiffen. IV diazepam 0.2 mg/kg was administered, which quickly aborted the suspected seizure. An hour later, the convulsions recurred, and he received another 0.2 mg/kg dose of diazepam, again effectively terminating the seizure.\n\n【12】DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT\n---------------------\n\n【13】The child’s laboratory results (taken on initial assessment) are shown in Fig. 2 . Differential diagnosis considered at the time is shown in Fig. 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Patient’s laboratory results upon presentation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Differential diagnosis considered.</u>\n\n【16】THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION\n------------------------\n\n【17】Therapeutic approach included supportive care and cessation of nalidixic acid. Due to his high white cell count, the child received empiric IV ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg initially until we could rule out meningoencephalitis as the cause of seizures. He also received IV hydration during his post-ictal phase, and later oral zinc for his diarrhoea. The child was discharged home neurologically intact after remaining seizure-free during his 48 hours of observation on the paediatric ward.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Venous blood gas (VBG) revealed an overall acidaemia from mixed anion- and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, plus an element of respiratory alkalosis. We did not have a lactic acid assay available so we were unable to assess its contributions to the anion gap. Note that nalidixic acid, through its interference with lactate metabolism, is a recognized cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Presumably, the non-anion gap acidosis component of the VBG was from bicarbonate loss in diarrhoea.\n\n【20】Nalidixic acid is a bactericidal antimicrobial of the synthetic quinolone class, and its use is contraindicated in children < 3 months old. It is known to lower the seizure threshold in patients with predisposition to seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Nalidixic acid has been traditionally used in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) and shigellosis. The recommended therapeutic dose for children is 55 mg/kg/day in four equally divided doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Prescription of quinolones is declining worldwide due to safety concerns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, along with increasing antimicrobial resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, nalidixic acid is still seen in some resource-limited settings.\n\n【23】Case reports exist of seizures and acidosis from nalidixic acid at therapeutic dose and in overdose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has also been reported from therapeutic doses of nalidixic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, and it is listed as a potential adverse effect by its manufacturers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare neurological disorder in children characterized by raised intracranial pressure in the absence of hydrocephalus, structural or vascular malformations, or brain parenchymal masses or infections.\n\n【25】IIH is not typically associated with seizures but can present as unexplained irritability in a young child 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our HRLS setting, we do not have consistent access to complete blood count, lumbar puncture (LP), lactate, extended electrolytes (including calcium), liver function testing, neuro-imaging or electroencephalogram. Thus, without opening pressures by LP, we cannot conclusively state that this was a case of IIH. However, upon exclusion of other causes by clinical suspicion and the limited blood tests in our setting, we believe that nalidixic acid was the cause of this child’s seizures by direct toxic effects in overdose (as implied by the metabolic acidosis), or from nalidixic acid-induced IIH or reduced seizure threshold at therapeutic dose. While simethicone was also given to the patient at the same time, there are no reported drug interactions with simethicone and nalidixic acid, and simethicone is not noted to cause convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Nalidixic acid continues to be prescribed as an antibiotic for diarrhoea and UTI in resource-limited settings, and as our case in Northern Iraq demonstrates, it should be considered as a cause of convulsions in any seizing child who has been exposed to it. Furthermore quinolones, including nalidixic acid, should be used with caution in young children and should never be prescribed to children under the age of 3 months.\n\n【28】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【29】Written informed consent for the publication of this case was obtained from the child’s father.

Radiological evaluation plays a great role to ensure an early diagnosis. Here, we report a 48-year-old woman who was presented with a mucoid vaginal discharge 10 years after a supracervical hysterectomy. Despite normal biopsy and cytology, magnetic resonance imaging showed a large cervix and multiple cervical cysts that considered adenoma malignum as a differential diagnosis. She underwent surgery and the pathology confirmed the adenoma malignum. In conclusion, radiologists, as well as gynecologists, and also pathologists may consider MDA among the differential diagnosis in patients with a vaginal discharge and multicysts in the cervix even after hysterectomy despite normal cytology and biopsy.\n\n【2】minimal deviation adenocarcinoma , adenoma malignum , cervical cancer , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of the cervix, otherwise known as adenoma malignum, is a rare variety of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix with multiple lobulations of distorted glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

We report a MDA case which developed after subtotal hysterectomy and was diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and managed surgically.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman (Gravid 2, Para 2) was referred from a private clinic to an academic hospital with a chief complaint of mucoid vaginal discharge for 4 years. She had a history of supracervical hysterectomy 10 years ago due to abnormal vaginal bleeding and uterine myoma. The pathology report showed a large uterus with multiple myoma. In physical examination, cervix appearance was slightly larger than normal and the evidence of chronic cervicitis was observed. The Thin Prep Pap smear was negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies. Colposcopy showed chronic inflammation and benign nabothian cysts without any malignant cells. She underwent a vaginal and abdominal ultrasound of cervix that revealed just nabothian cysts.\n\n【8】She performed MRI that showed a large cervix (63 × 50 × 44 mm) and multiple cervical cysts with the different sizes that suggested Tunnel Cluster . She was on stage Ib with no evidence of adnexal lesion. At this moment, adenoma malignum was considered as a main differential diagnosis that suggested by consultant radiologist.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|MRI appearance of pelvic before surgery with contrast.

Lymph node biopsy was normal. In pathology, the cervix was barrel shaped measuring 3 cm in length and 4 × 4 cm in diameters. The maximal depth of stromal invasion was 14 mm. Microscopic examination reveals atypical architecture including irregularly shaped, dilated and crowded glands with claw or crab-like profiles, intraluminal tufting , with pale round nuclei with minimal atypia and rare mitoses that invaded deep one-third of cervix (14 mm), near to the pericervical adipose tissue  suggesting adenoma malignum.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Well-differentiated irregularly shaped, dilated and crowded glands with desmoplastic response (hematoxylin and eosin \\[H&E\\] stain) ( **A** ).

In follow-up after 1 year by MRI and physical examination, she did not have any complication or relapse of the disease.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】MDA is a subcategory of mucinous adenocarcinoma of cervix. The mean age at diagnosis is 45 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Despite its benign appearance in histology, MDA could have an unfavorable prognosis (not necessary poor) due to lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, so timely and correct diagnosis is essential. Our case was in stage I and survived after 12 months follow-up without relapse.\n\n【15】Guo _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> reported two cases with MDA with watery discharge and enlarged cervix. One case had a history of myomectomy and ovarian cystectomy 10 years before. It may due to the cooperation of adenoma malignum with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome or ovarian tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, the pathology of the ovaries was nonspecific and no other abnormalities were detected in upper abdomen.\n\n【16】MDA unlike cervical squamous cell carcinoma is usually located deep within the endocervix. The detection rate of Pap smear, punch biopsy and conization were 7.6, 62.5 and 40% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our study, the Pap test was negative and the cervical biopsy was normal either, because the mass was very close to the internal os and not easy to access, we preferred a non-invasive diagnostic method with MRI.\n\n【17】A differential diagnosis of adenoma maligna on MRI is pseudoneoplastic glandular lesions and may mimic benign deep endocervical glands. Although normal glands are much fewer in number and have regular spaces, normal architecture and lack of cytological atypia and do not extend beyond 8 mm, but the depth of invasion in our case was 14 mm.\n\n【18】MRI evaluation of our case showed a large cervix and multiple cervical cysts with different sizes that suggested Tunnel Cluster. Multiple cystic lesions are classified based on the volume of solid component, the atypia and cellular activity, and the degree of invasion of the cervical stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasias (with or without atypia) are the differential diagnosis, but they have mucoid discharge and packed glands that are uniform without complex morphology and sensible cytological atypia. Indeed, they usually demonstrate no cervical enlargement and no solid component with no stromal invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Also, endocervical type adenomyoma is a rare benign tumor similar to MDA and despite a lobular arrangement; it has irregular outlines and papillary infoldings. Other differential diagnosis include HPV-related adenocarcinoma (particularly of mucinous type), endometrial adenocarcinoma and though rare metastatic adenocarcinoma with gastric or pancreatic origin.\n\n【20】HIK-1083 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, CEA, Ki67 and p53 staining may be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> and P16 as a marker for HPV is typically negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Considering the differential diagnosis and confirming the diagnosis by pathology and radiology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) reveals overlapping profile with limited value. According to the available evidences, we did not request IHC.\n\n【21】Surgery is the optimal option to manage MDA and including a radical hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy at the early stages and for advanced stages chemoradiotherapy is performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In the cases of hysterectomy with benign indications like ours, subsequent staging operations to define the exact tumor status may be necessary and adjuvant therapy based on surgical outcomes would be indicated. Our patient underwent removal of residual of uterine and cervix with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Lymph node biopsy was negative and no adjuvant therapy was needed.\n\n【22】The prognosis of MDA is known to be relatively poor especially in advanced stages, and it is more aggressive than HPV-associated cervical adenocarcinoma with tendency to lymph node metastasis and early peritoneal and abdominal spread. The 5-year survival is estimated to be 42% compared with 91% for endocervical adenocarcinoma. Otherwise in 1-year follow-up, no sign of further relapse was seen in this case.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】In conclusion, timely and prompt diagnosis is very critical in MDA. Therefore, radiologists as well as gynecologists and also the pathologists shall consider MDA among the differential diagnoses in the patients with a vaginal discharge and multicysts in cervix. Future research and longer follow-up are recommended to understand the nature of MDA to provide optimal management.\n\n【25】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【26】E.S.: Project development, manuscript writing.

A previously well 18-year-old man presented with increasingly erythematous eyes and oral and genital ulceration 2 weeks after confirmation of COVID-19 infection. Clinical examination showed sloughy membranous conjunctivitis with normal visual acuity. He was reviewed by dermatology and diagnosed with EMM secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The symptoms resolved with oral and topical steroids, lubricants and chloramphenicol eye drops. Erythema multiforme has been reported in association with COVID-19, although the major form is rare. Ophthalmologists should consider current or previous COVID-19 infection in patients presenting with conjunctivitis or pseudomembrane formation. Prompt initiation of steroids aids resolution.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Our understanding of the presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has advanced significantly since its identification in December 2019. Classical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath but other clinical manifestations have since been described including associated dermatological and ocular manifestations. Common cutaneous signs include urticarial, erythematous and papulovesicular rashes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, whereas dry eye and conjunctivitis are the most frequently reported ophthalmic signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Erythema multiforme (EM) in association with COVID-19 has been documented in several case reports, but most present with a minor form of the disease and ocular involvement has been rare. We report a case of bilateral bulbar membranous conjunctivitis in a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related erythema multiforme major (EMM).\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A previously fit and well 18-year-old man presented to the eye casualty with 7 days of increasingly red eyes, no discharge, a feeling of heaviness around the eyes, and oral and penile ulcers. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 3 weeks earlier and had symptoms of fatigue, anosmia, headache, shortness of breath and sore throat. The eye symptoms and ulcers came on after resolution of his COVID-19 symptoms. On Day 1 of his eye symptoms, he had a remote consultation with a tertiary eye casualty and was given lubricating eye drops for presumed viral conjunctivitis. A day after this, he was prescribed oral penicillin V for a sore throat and developed the penile and mouth ulcers as soon as he took the antibiotics . His general practitioner (GP) referred him to dermatology and rheumatology for investigation.\n\n【7】He was referred for review in eye casualty from the dermatology clinic, and presented 7 days after the red eyes and 6 days after the oral and genital ulceration had begun. On examination visual acuity was 6/6 in the right and 6/9 in the left. There was diffuse injection of the bulbar conjunctiva with bilateral conjunctival pseudomembranes, but no tarsal conjunctival epithelial defect on eversion of the lid . The corneas were clear with no epithelial defects. He was started on copious lubrication, 2 hourly preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% drops, and preservative-free chloramphenicol drops 4 times a day as prophylaxis. Two days later, his symptomatology improved, and the bulbar conjunctival injection and pseudomembranes improved significantly. The patient was reviewed again by dermatology and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 associated EMM following the results of a 3-mm punch biopsy of the lower lip, which showed ulcerated skin with focal interface mucositis . He was started on prednisolone 30 mg orally for 1 week. He was advised to continue the chloramphenicol and taper down the dexamethasone drops. Two weeks later he made a full recovery. There were no ophthalmic signs and no remaining ulcers. He was advised to stop the chloramphenicol and taper off the dexamethasone drops gradually.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Mouth ulcers.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Right eye membranous conjunctivitis.

Despite advances in treatment, it remains under detected and under treated. As an inherited condition, it poses a risk to the patient and family members. Most cases are due to defective low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) activity. Heterozygous mutations are common (1:250–1:300). Homozygous FH is very rare (2–3 in a million), with higher circulating cholesterol levels and a poorer cardiovascular prognosis. We present the management of a case of homozygous hypercholesterolemia due to homozygous LDLR mutation. The patient subsequently developed severe coronary artery and aortic valve disease despite aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. We review advanced lipid management options that include lipoprotein apheresis, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 inhibition, and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) accelerates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). Most commonly this is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, but rarely (~5% of cases) mutations in Apolipoprotein B-100 (APO-B), the ligand for LDLR, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9 _),_ Apolipoprotein E or LDLR adaptor protein genes are responsible. We present a rare case of extreme hypercholesterolaemia due to homozygous mutation in LDLR, complicated by multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic stenosis (AS).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old Indian man presented to endocrine services in 2012 with total cholesterol levels of 22 mmol/l \\[normal < 4.0 mmol/l\\]. He was asymptomatic. Corneal arcus and tendon xanthoma (dorsum of both hands, pre-tibial and Achilles tendons) were present . There was an ejection systolic murmur, normal peripheral pulses, and no organomegaly. Genotyping confirmed homozygous FH (HoFH) due to two LDLR gene mutations (the pathogenic p.Pro685Leu variant, identified in 25/2600 index FH cases, and once in homozygosity in large French database). The parents were first cousins. Interestingly, there was no family history of premature ACVD. His father died aged 82 and his mother aged 90. His three siblings have no known ACVD. Mandatory cascade testing showed high LDL levels in all six daughters with heterozygous FH (HeFH) status in all children _._ He has a history of hypertension managed on three agents. He worked as a teacher and does not drink alcohol or smoke. His lipid-lowering interventions are summarized in . Although LDL apheresis produced an ~ 83% reduction in LDL-C immediately after apheresis, LDL-C levels returned to baseline within days, and interval mean LDL-C remained high. Multiple interruptions to LDL-apheresis occurred due to arteriovenous fistula failure, which ultimately occluded after 18 months.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Pathognomonic signs of FH: tendon xanthoma deposits of cholesterol rich fat on the dorsum of both hands and knees.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Impact of sequential cholesterol lowering interventions on the patient’s lipid profile over time are shown, the ESC target LDL threshold (1.4 mmol/l) is shown in the broken line; to date lipoprotein apheresis achieved the greatest LDL-C reductions (−83% immediately post apheresis), but interval LDL-C were typically 11.8 mmol/l (−35%) equivalent to current therapy which can be managed in the home environment.</u>\n\n【8】Cardiac computed tomography (CT) to screen for ACVD, confirmed multi-vessel CAD with extensive calcification of the ascending aorta, aortic valve, and posterior mitral annulus . Echocardiography confirmed severe AS (valve area: 0.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> ).

Subsequently, the molecular basis of hypercholesterolemia has been determined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. HeFH is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder (prevalence of 1:250–300), increasing premature ACVD risk ~20-fold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. HoFH is very rare and life threatening. Characterized by > 4-fold increase in LDL-C from birth, the first major cardiovascular event is frequently in adolescence but occasionally early childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis and treatment improve clinical outcomes.\n\n【12】European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines emphasize a goal-targeted approach to reduce LDL-C for very high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Hyperlipidemia Education and Atherosclerosis Research Trust in the UK recommends an LDL-C target of 1.8 mmol/L and 2.5 mmol/L for HoFH patients with, and without, ACVD respectively. Patients may fail to reach desired targets despite aggressive treatment, here the aim to achieve the maximum reduction with minimum side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Persistent hypercholesterolemia despite combination triple therapy (statin, ezetimibe and fenofibrate) triggers specialist lipid clinic referral.\n\n【13】Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, which typically achieves ~ 16% LDL-C reduction, was tried but discontinued due to gastrointestinal side effects. LDL-C remained high, fulfilling criteria for LDL-apheresis.\n\n【14】LDL-apheresis, although not widely available, is highly effective at LDL removal (by 50–70%) from plasma, reducing cardiovascular events by 80–90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, target interval LDL-C levels may not be achieved despite immediate post-treatment reduction. For example, our patient’s interval LDL-C values were 11.8 mmol/l with LDL apheresis every 2 weeks.\n\n【15】PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies inhibiting degradation of LDLR, thus increasing cholesterol clearance by hepatocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Two Food and Drug Administration-approved PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolucumab, are given as injections every 2–4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Evolocumab reduces LDL-C in HoFH patients with or without lipoprotein apheresis (Trial Assessing Long Term USe of PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Genetic LDL Disorders study) accompanied by a reduction in cardiovascular events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, the addition of PCSK9 inhibition \\[420 mg injections fortnightly\\] was ineffective in our patient (~1% LDL reduction). This may be related to the complex spectrum of consequences of the Pro685Leu mutation, which in functional assays include defective processing, accelerated turnover, reduced cell surface expression and impaired LDLR activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–9 \\]</u>. Therefore, lomitapide \\[5 mg ON\\] was added to the medication regime.\n\n【16】Lomitapide is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor that reduces plasma levels of all APO-B-containing lipoproteins. In our patient, this achieved a 54% reduction in LDL-C after 6 months of treatment (the most recent LDL-C is 8.33 mmol/l). Further dose escalation is planned. Phase II and III, single-arm studies in HoFH show dose-dependent LDL-C reductions between 25 and 51% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. An observational study showed a 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The monitoring of transaminases is necessary during lomitapide treatment due to increased hepatic fat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Aside from the complexities of this patient’s lipid management, it is notable that significant cardiovascular complications have arisen in the absence of symptoms. CVD risk assessment tools developed for the general population do not apply to FH patients as the atherosclerotic burden from long-term exposure to high LDL levels is underestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】HoFH is a very rare severe genetic disorder with cholesterol levels > 4-fold normal from birth. Given the increased ACVD risk patients require a multi-agency approach to their care and regular screening for cardiovascular complications.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**_Conflict of interest statement_** .

Her ECG showed a PR interval of 160 ms in lead II, and a delta wave pattern in leads V2 and V3, with a normal QRS interval of 100 ms. We analyzed the three criteria for confirmation of minimal pre-excitation: (i) absence of a Q wave in V6; (ii) presence of an R wave in V1 and (iii) absence of an R wave in avR. The 3 criteria were not met and failed to establish a diagnosis of ventricular pre-excitation. The electrophysiological study confirmed the presence of a left accessory pathway. A new criterion was analyzed: the variation of the PR interval on the same ECG. A difference of >30 ms was successful to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway before ablation and its absence after catheter ablation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The classic ECG criteria for pre-excitation syndrome includes: (i) a short PR interval <120 ms, (ii) the presence of a delta wave (slurring of the initial portion of the QRS interval) and (iii) an increased QRS duration of >110 ms When there is minimal pre-excitation on a 12-lead ECG, the diagnosis of ventricular pre-excitation can be challenging. There are another three criteria to confirm or exclude the presence of an accessory pathway, which include: (i) absence of a Q wave in lead V6, (ii) presence of an R wave in lead V1 and (iii) absence of an R wave in lead avR. In the following patient we studied the three criteria which failed to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway, although the electrophysiological study found a left lateral accessory pathway with orthodromic reentrant tachycardia. We thus analyzed another criterion for the differential diagnosis: the variation of the PR interval which is the difference of the longest PR interval and the shortest PR interval of the 12-lead ECG.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 14-year-old female patient was hospitalized in our Cardiology Department for repeated episodes of PSVT which started at the age of 11. She was treated with Bisoprolol 2,5 mg but presented PSVT despite antiarrhythmic drugs. The 12-lead ECG showed minimal pre-excitation, with a small delta wave in leads V2–V3 but with a normal QRS complex of 100 ms and a normal PR interval in lead II of 160 ms. The three classical criteria for confirmation/exclusion of an accessory pathway were analyzed: there was a Q wave in lead V6, the precordial transition was after lead V1 and a R wave was present in lead avR. Therefore, the three criteria failed to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway. We measured the longest and the shortest PR interval and found a difference of 40 ms between leads II and V2.  Before the electrophysiological study, an echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and normal dimensions for the cardiac chambers, without any valvulopathy . During electrophysiological study 4 catheters were introduced through the right femoral vein: a quadripolar catheter at the level of the high right atrium, a quadripolar catheter at the level of the His bundle, a decapolar catheter at the level of the coronary sinus and the ablation catheter at the level of the right ventricle. During ventricular stimulation the retrograde conduction was through a left lateral accessory pathway, which was further confirmed by the activation through the coronary sinus catheter . As the accessory pathway was lateral, a trans-septal approach was performed using the Brockenborg needle for the septal puncture .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7:|删除段之间换行|Before adenosine injection there is a small wave at the beginning of the QRS interval, which should be differentiated from a delta wave.

Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway was performed using 35 W and 55 C. After ablation there was no anterograde or retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway. After 30 min the procedure was stopped and the patient returned to her room. The 12-lead ECG performed after catheter ablation was compared with the ECG before ablation and the three classical criteria were once again insufficient to establish the presence or absence of an accessory pathway.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Fluoroscopic image during catheter ablation of the left lateral accessory pathway.

White arrow: the high right atrial catheter.</u>\n\n【13】Our criteria of PR variation of >30 ms confirmed the presence of the accessory pathway before ablation and the absence of the accessory pathway after ablation . Furthermore an adenosine test was performed to exclude the presence of the accessory pathway after ablation which produced a 2:1 AV block. After ablation the PR interval variation was 5 ms .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6:|删除段之间换行|After catheter ablation, the variation of the PR interval is 5 ms (the PR interval in lead II is 120 ms and the PR interval in lead V2 is 115 ms).</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Identification of ventricular pre-excitation syndrome using surface ECG is essential due to the high risk of sudden cardiac death represented by this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The characteristic ECG elements for this syndrome are: (i) the presence of a short PR interval, (ii) the presence of the delta wave (with slurring of initial portion of the QRS) and (iii) the prolongation of the QRS complex >110 ms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Cases with a normal PR interval are possible in patients with accessory pathways. This may occur due to the presence of a long Kent bundle, localized on the left side with delayed atrial conduction. The PR interval might be at the lower limit of normality (120–130 ms). In our case, the accessory pathway was localized in the far lateral mitral ring.\n\n【18】Diagnostic problems occur when the PR interval is <120 ms, the delta wave is barely visible and the QRS complex is not more than 110 ms. As a solution to this limitation, Bogun _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> claimed that the absence of a septal Q wave in V6 is an indirect sign of pre-excitation. In their study on 37 patients with minimal pre-excitation, while none of the patients presented a septal Q wave prior to treatment, 80% of them recovered it after ablation.\n\n【19】ECG is a non-invasive tool to determining the general location of an accessory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Studies report that patients with left-sided accessory pathways present counterclockwise rotation of QRS transitional zone, more specifically, in lead V1 or prior to that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In their early classification of type A or B pre-excitation, Rosenbaum _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> identified a direct correlation between the presence of left-sided pathways and early horizontal transition in precordial leads. This claim is strengthened by the fact that left free wall pathways cause an earlier activation of the left ventricle, thus generating a right bundle branch block pattern. In the study of Eisenberger _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> on 238 WPW patients, 7% presented a septal R wave in lead avR prior to ablation, and 71% post-treatment. Absence of the R wave in lead avR has a good sensibility for the presence of an accessory pathway.\n\n【20】In unclear cases with minimal pre-excitation, another tool for the ECG diagnosis is the difference between the longest and the shortest PR interval on the same ECG reading. A difference of more than 30 ms in our case was successful in confirming the presence of the accessory pathway before ablation, and excluding it after successful treatment.\n\n【21】The use of a selective AV nodal blocking agent (such as adenosine) can non-invasively confirm or exclude a pre-excitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.

She was a life-long non-smoker and worked as a medical transcriptionist. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules. She was placed on prednisone 40 mg daily for presumed sarcoidosis. At three months she reported subjective improvement, however a repeat chest CT confirmed persistence of bilateral lung nodules and circumferential mural thickening and narrowing the central airways . She ultimately underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy of a right upper lobe lung nodule. The pathological examination demonstrated lung parenchyma with features consistent with amyloid deposition. Specimen was sent to Mayo Clinic to perform laser-capture microdissection with liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry for amyloid typing, which identified κ light chain as the amyloidogenic protein. Prednisone was tapered off, and she was referred to our institute for further management.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(a) Chest CT shows multiple bilateral lung nodules, some with central calcifications (arrowhead) and variable-sized cysts  in all lung lobes.

(b) Chest CT angiography shows diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage (in the setting of hemoptysis) with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and cysts. Note, presence of endobronchial soft-tissues within RML segmental and subsegmental bronchi .</u>\n\n【8】Her complete blood count, kidney function and calcium level were within normal limit. Serum free light chain assay was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis was positive for M-protein (0.98 mg/dL). Serum immunofixation revealed mildly elevated IgG \\[1620 mg/dL (ref. 717–1411 mg/dL)\\] and κ level \\[1290 mg/dL (ref. 534–1267 mg/dL)\\]. A 24-hour urine protein was normal and no M-protein was identified on urine protein electrophoresis. Troponin and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide were normal. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction with normal diastolic function. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of clonal plasma cells. Given normal serum light chain assay, normal bone marrow biopsy, and lack of systemic involvement, she was diagnosed with localized AL amyloidosis involving the lung. She was also diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) based on positive serum M-protein. No treatment was started, and she was followed with hematology/oncology every 6 months. Of note, bronchoscopy was initially not performed because airway involvement was not reported on the initial CT and the patient was largely asymptomatic when the follow-up chest CT reported evident airway involvement.\n\n【9】Four years later, she developed an episode of hemoptysis. Chest CT angiography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and airway involvement . She underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed multiple yellowish plaques in the mucosal areas involving the subglottic space, trachea, segmental and subsegmental bronchi and a number of infiltrative nodules . Endobronchial biopsies were performed. Pathology of fragments of bronchial mucosa showed extensive amyloid deposits on Congo red stain, consistent with endobronchial amyloidosis . She was treated with bronchoscopic therapy twice at 3 months interval using argon plasma coagulation with resolution of symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy shows multiple yellowish plaques  and raised nodular infiltration  of airway mucosa in (a) right upper lobe (b) right middle lobe.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrographs of the endobronchial biopsy (a) deposits of amorphous, eosinophilic, waxy-like material (A) with ossification (B), underlying the bronchial epithelium (arrow), H&E, 10x.

She was incidentally noted to have an enlarged right submandibular salivary gland on CT imaging and underwent biopsy in December 2016, which revealed AL (κ) amyloid deposition. By the time this manuscript was being prepared, she remained asymptomatic. She has had stable MGUS with faint serum M protein (0.99 mg/dL) and mildly elevated serum free κ light chain \\[25.5 mg/L (ref. 3.3–19.4 mg/L)\\] on the most recent follow-up studies.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Pulmonary amyloidosis can be localized or part of systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Based on the anatomic site of involvement, pulmonary amyloidosis can be classified into 3 forms: nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, tracheobronchial amyloidosis and diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The former two are usually seen in localized pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nodular amyloidosis is slightly more prevalent than tracheobronchial amyloidosis. In a cases series of 55 patients with pulmonary amyloidosis reported by Mayo Clinic from 1980 to 1993, 11 patients had localized pulmonary amyloidosis. Among them, 7 patients had nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, and 4 patients had tracheobronchial amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Both lung parenchymal and tracheobronchial amyloidosis can be seen in systemic amyloidosis, but rarely present together in localized forms of pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In an autopsy study of 11 patients who had lung involvement of systemic amyloidosis, amyloid deposition was found in both alveolar and tracheobronchial mucosa in all 7 patients in whom both alveolar and tracheobronchial histologic examination were available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Only 1 case reported a large solitary pulmonary amyloid tumor protruding into the bronchus lumen, however it did not mention if that patient had systemic or localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, although amyloid deposition was noted in the parotid gland, there was no evidence of other systemic involvement, thus the patient was thought to have localized amyloidosis.\n\n【15】Localized AL amyloidosis generally has an excellent long-term prognosis and rarely evolves into systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In a study of 606 patients with localized amyloidosis (defined as amyloid deposition at one non-vital organ site and with no evidence of systemic organ involvement such as heart, kidney, liver, nerve or tongue), including 35 cases (6%) with tracheobronchial amyloidosis and 47 cases (8%) of nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, only 7 patients (1%) progressed to systemic amyloidosis at a median follow-up of 74 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

This was reported to be a sign of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). On Day 13, due to poor clinical progression and multiple negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for COVID-19, an alternative diagnosis was sought. Subsequently, this led to a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. This case demonstrates complicating factors in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the presence of cognitive bias during a pandemic, which may lead clinicians to overlook a diagnosis, which may otherwise be addressed earlier.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Typically it presents with fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, in addition to ground-glass opacities (GGO) on chest computed tomography (CT) typically in the peripheries, but can be seen to vary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which occurs due to the opportunistic fungal pathogen _Pneumocystis jirovecii._ Historically, it is associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), however, due to increasing use of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence is now greater in non-HIV associated cases of, for example, malignancy and immunosuppression, which have a higher rate of mortality, reported between 30% and 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Typically it presents with exertional dyspnoea, fever and non-productive cough, with bilateral GGO on chest CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is commonly in a central distribution but can vary and be in a more diffuse pattern, alongside less common findings of consolidation, nodules and cystic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】This case presented difficulties in diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting lessons to be learnt.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 52-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of worsening abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. On examination she was peritonitic, tachycardic, hypotensive and tachypnoeic with a new oxygen requirement of 4 L.\n\n【8】She had a history of lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases diagnosed 3 months prior to this presentation, for which she had a craniotomy with resection of metastases and cyberknife radiotherapy. In addition, she was on a weaning regime of oral dexamethasone for the brain metastases, on 2 mg three times a day at presentation, reduced from 8 mg twice daily over the prior 3 months since the diagnosis of malignancy. She had no other significant past medical history and the only other medications she took were lansoprazole for gastric protection whilst on dexamethasone and hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. She had not started other treatments for her malignancy prior to this presentation.\n\n【9】Imaging demonstrated perforation of the large bowel secondary to diverticulitis, and a coincidental finding of bilateral, patchy GGO of both the central and peripheral lung fields. This was reported to be a probable sign of COVID-19 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[ Fig 1 and 2 \\]</u>. Subsequently, she underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and ileostomy formation.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|A coronal slice of CT chest showing bilateral ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|An axial slice of CT chest showing bilateral ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n【12】Post-operatively, due to the chest CT findings, she was managed as COVID-19 positive. Five reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 tests, however, were negative (nose/throat swabs on Days 1 and 10, bronchoalveolar lavage samples on Days 2 and 4, endotracheal secretions on Day 13). On Day 13, due to poor clinical progression preventing successful post-operative extubation, with increasing bilateral areas of ground glass changes on CT, persistently raised inflammatory markers and ongoing pyrexia (despite broad antibiotic cover), an alternative diagnosis was sought to explain the chest CT findings. A screening for alternative respiratory infections was carried out, which detected _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ DNA in sputum and Beta D gluten antigen in serum.\n\n【13】Subsequently, the patient was commenced on 21 days of co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP, resulting in significant clinical improvement and hospital discharge.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】This case highlights two discussion points.\n\n【16】The first is the diagnosis of COVID-19, due to the discrepancy between the multiple negative RT-PCR tests and the chest CT that was reported as possible COVID-19. This discrepancy is discussed in a systematic review of the accuracy of RT-PCR testing at the time, which concluded that false negative results ranged from 2% to 29% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In addition, a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, found that in patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% had positive chest CT findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Subsequently, they concluded that a chest CT had a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in comparison to RT-PCR from swab samples, and made the suggestion that CT should be considered as the primary diagnostic tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The second is the diagnosis of PCP, which arguably should have been on the early list of differentials for a number of reasons.\n\n【18】First, the patient was potentially at risk of developing PCP due to the use of dexamethasone without PCP prophylaxis. This use of corticosteroid prior to the development of PCP is found in up to 90% of cases, and guidelines suggest the use of prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole when a patient is receiving more than the equivalent of 20 mg of prednisolone a day for >4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, her risk of developing PCP may have been compounded by her underlying malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Second, the bilateral GGO on CT that were reported to be a probable sign of COVID-19 were arguably more in keeping with PCP which has a more central distribution in comparison to the peripheries in COVID-19, however, this can vary in distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The diagnosis of PCP in this case may have been influenced by the presence of cognitive bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cognitive bias refers to the unconscious thoughts and behaviours that influence decision-making 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. ‘Availability bias’, in particular, which is the influence of observing a high prevalence of a particular disease, such as COVID-19 during the pandemic may have played a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Subsequently, with COVID-19 at the forefront of the clinician’s mind, additional diagnoses of COVID-19 may have been made prior to the consideration of differentials, for example, those that cause GGO on CT, not only limited to PCP, such as influenza pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】In conclusion, with SARS-CoV-2 likely to become endemic in our society, it is crucial that we continue to enhance our knowledge of COVID-19 to improve our diagnosis and management. Furthermore, with the possibility of pandemics becoming a more common occurrence, it is paramount that clinicians maintain an awareness of the presence of cognitive bias in diagnosis during a pandemic. Similar cases in which cognitive bias has influenced clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic are not widely discussed in the literature. This should arguably receive more attention to allow clinicians to address their clinical practice to reduce such biases. These biases may otherwise result in a delay in reaching the correct diagnosis, which could be fatal.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEGMENT\n-------------\n\n【23】There is no funding to report for this submission.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors stated in the manuscript, accept full responsibility for the work, had access to the data, and controlled the decision to publish.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She had history of fever and sore throat a week before for which she was treated with oral co-amoxiclav and paracetamol at the local health facility. Dysphagia was present both for solid and liquids. There was no history of use of any steroids or immunocompromising drugs. She had no history of smoking or alcohol use. Also, there was no personal or family history of antecedent HSV exposure. On examination, her vitals were normal. Her general and systemic examination findings were within normal limits. Her oral examination revealed no ulcer or blisters. During the initial evaluation of fever, her investigations for etiologies of fever including Malaria, Dengue, Typhoid, Leptospira, Scrub typhus were unremarkable. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was done which was negative. Sonological examination of abdomen was unremarkable.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Endoscopic examination of herpes esophagitis showing multiple ulcers with hemorrhages especially in the middle and distal third of esophagus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Histological features of herpes esophagitis showing Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies in infected epithelial cells (H&E, ×200, closed arrow).</u>\n\n【8】Serology for Human Immunodeficiency virus I and II (HIV I/II), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to Hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were nonreactive. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy was done which revealed multiple ulcers with hemorrhages especially in the middle and distal third of esophagus . The gastroesophageal junction, stomach and duodenum were normal. Multiple biopsies were taken from the ulcerated area for histopathology. Her histopathology report revealed viable squamous epithelium cells around ulcerative margin showing eosinophilic round intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A inclusion bodies) separated by clear zone from thickened nuclear membrane features. There was no evidence of atypia or malignancy . These findings were suggestive of HSE. Serology done for HSV I/II IgG level was 6.30 AU/ml (reference range: < 2 AU/ml) i.e. raised above normal range. With these, the diagnosis of HSE was made and she was started on intravenous acyclovir for initial 5 days. Later acyclovir was continued orally for total 10 days. Upper GI endoscopy was repeated after 7 days showed marked improvement in the ulcers with most of them already healing. She was discharged on oral acyclovir and sucralfate suspension. At the time of discharge, she could take orally well and her symptoms of dysphagia and odynophagia have almost disappeared. On follow-up after two weeks she was free from all symptoms and tolerating orally.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】HSV is a DNA virus which can cause wide range of disease from inapparent to fatal illness. The site of involvement, immune status of host and whether the disease is primary or recurrent are the determinant of severity of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common visceral organ infected by HSV is esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. HSE usually results from reactivation of HSV and spread of virus to esophageal mucosa via vagus nerve or direct extension of oropharyngeal infection into esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A study conducted by Canalejo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> showed 44% patient had primary infection on the basis of serology.\n\n【11】HSE commonly occurs in persons with clinical evidence of immunosuppression but several cases of HSE in immunocompetent host have been described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. The common presentation in HSE is odynophagia, dysphagia and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Reported cases of HSE were diagnosed by various methods such as endoscopy, blood test of IgM and IgG for HSV I/II, viral tissue culture and viral DNA PCR. The gold standard for diagnosing the infection is obtaining biopsy from esophageal mucosa with microscopic evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Acyclovir 400 mg orally five times a day for 14 to 21 days is standard treatment for immunocompromised host in HSE. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs in immunocompetent hosts after 1–2 weeks even without treatment. However, the patient may respond quickly if treated with a short course of oral acyclovir.\n\n【12】In this case, the patient was immunocompetent without any history of immunosuppressive drugs. There was neither history of previous herpetic infection nor evidence of herpes labialis or oropharyngeal ulcer on examination. The diagnosis was based on endoscopic finding and histopathological examination of sample obtained from lesion in esophageal mucosa during endoscopy. The typical findings of upper GI endoscopy are multiple mucosal ulcers which are well circumscribed and have a ‘volcano-like’ appearance. Yield is better if biopsies or brushing are taken from the edge of an ulcer where viral cytopathic effects are most likely to be present. In our patient, the lesions of esophagus were not typical as described however the histopathology and serology for HSV supported the diagnosis. Viral culture, and DNA PCR for HSV could not be performed because of nonavailability. There was quick response to the treatment with acyclovir.\n\n【13】HSE should be suspected in a healthy patient with acute onset of dysphagia or odynophagia with typical ulcerations in the upper Gi endoscopy. Endoscopy should be performed in these patients with symptoms of esophagitis and biopsy should be taken to confirm the diagnosis. With the confirmation of HSE careful history taking should be obtained to rule out any immune disorder such as HIV. Although HSE in immunocompetent host is self-limiting use of acyclovir may hasten the recovery.\n\n【14】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【15】No ethical approval was needed for this case report.\n\n【16】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【17】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.

His history included refractory hypertension for 7 years, though he was receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs, including Valsartan (320 mg), Atenolol (50 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), spironolactone (75 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg). He also had a history of intracranial haemorrhage with complete recovery. His family history indicated a deceased cousin due to end-stage renal disease. On examination, he had elevated blood pressure (180/90), a distended but soft abdomen and a liver edge palpable 2 cm below the costal ribs.\n\n【9】Abdominal ultrasonography revealed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in addition to multiple cysts in both kidneys **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>.** These findings were consistent with the ones in Multi-Slice Computerized Tomography (MSCT), in which three variable-sized cystic lesions were detected in both kidneys with a diameter of 32, 38 and 47 mm. The MSCT also showed the AAA that measured 3.6 cm, in addition to prostate hyperplasia. Furthermore, thorax MSCT images showed multiple aneurysms larger than 22 mm arising from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, the left circumflex and the right coronary artery. On echocardiography, there was an eccentric left ventricle hypertrophy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, while the electrocardiogram (ECG) uncovered a prominent left axis deviation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain showed an increased size of the cerebral ventricles in addition to multiple hypertensive lesions of 2–24 mm on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery and T2-Weighted Image. Laboratory tests revealed high levels of serum creatinine (6 mg/dl), urea (105 mg/dl), haemoglobin (9.1 g/dl) and platelets count (187\\*10 <sup>3 </sup> /dl). Twenty-four hours urinalysis showed an additional massive proteinuria of 4200 mg/dl, in addition to a trace of red blood cells without cellular casts in microscopic examination. The patient underwent a coronary catheterization in order to prepare him for renal transplantation, which clearly revealed ecstatic coronary arteries with multiple aneurysmal dilations in the three main coronary arteries **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 2 **)</u>** . Currently, the case is managed with haemodialysis sessions twice a week.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Herein, we report a case of an association between ADPKD and coronary arteries aneurysms (CAA). To our best knowledge, this rare association is only described 16 times in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of ADPKD in our patient was based on the presence of multiple bilateral kidney cysts and extrarenal manifestations (Ravine’s Criteria), after ruling out other possible pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, the clinical course of the disease, the patient’s age and the normal values of inflammatory markers make Kawasaki disease in this patient less likely. On the other hand, patients with ADPKD have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms between 9 and 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, which suggests that the haemorrhagic stroke in our patient was probably underlined by a cerebral aneurysm. Further study with magnetic resonance angiography is recommended. Neves _et al._ deduced in their systematic review that 6 out of 23 ADPKD patients (40%) have multiple coronary aneurysms as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although these multiple involvements of coronary arteries are more frequently reported in ADPKD patients, aneurysms in the other vessels are still quite a rare association in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common associated vascular aneurysm with CAA is an AAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The association between multiple giant coronary aneurysms, which is quite rare, and other aneurysms including the AAA and the suspected cerebral aneurysm makes the presentation of our case extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, because the combination between these three pathologies in the context of ADPKD was never reported before.\n\n【12】Furthermore, the giant cardiac aneurysms were diagnosed accidentally in our patient who did not have any cardiac symptoms, and this is consistent with the findings of the aforementioned systematic review, which showed that 6 out of the 13 patients with coronary artery aneurysms were asymptomatic (21%). This should draw attention towards the significant asymptomatic cardiac manifestations in ADPKD, which might prevent grave prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Although there are many recommendations regarding the isolated AAA and CAA, still such recommendation in the setting of ADPKD are unavailable. Boyer _et al._ recommended the surgical revascularization when a CAA involves the main stem of the left coronary artery, multivessel coronary artery disease is identified, a giant CAA is present or when other cardiac condition mandate surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence showed that all men aged 66 or more should be screened if they have not already been screened or they have one of the mentioned risk factors including hypertension. Additionally, they consider aneurysm repair for people with an unruptured AAA in case of symptomatic aneurysm, asymptomatic and larger than 4.0 cm with a growth by more than 1 cm in 1 year, or asymptomatic measuring ≥5.5 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Rare associations of vessels aneurysms might happen in patients with ADPKD, including the coexistence of AAA, giant multiple coronary aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms. Hypertension also represents a common manifestation of this entity and could be refractory as in our patient. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate for secondary causes in patients with refractory hypertension as early as possible and to screen for asymptomatic aneurysms in cases of ADPKD, in order to prevent serious complications.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Jalal Habash for his support in preparing this report.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), multi-slice computerized tomography (MSCT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the purpose of the publication of this case report and all accompanying images.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Assistant Prof. Sami Albitar.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is frequently used to evaluate for vitreous hemorrhage, foreign bodies, retinal detachment, optic neuritis and posterior vitreous detachment; however, it can also be used to evaluate for a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). A POCUS can reveal a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface, and this is referred to as a retrobulbar ‘spot sign’ (RBSS). We present the case of an 88-year-old male that presented to our community ED with a painless loss of vision to his right eye. A POCUS revealed an RBSS of the central retinal artery and he was subsequently diagnosed with a CRAO. At his 1-month follow-up, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision, however, remains with significant visual impairment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis. Research has shown that within 90–100 min of infarction, the retina begins to develop permanent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>.

The incidence is 8.5 per 100 000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This type of cerebral vascular accident has a mean age of 60–65 years, with over 90% of the cases involving patients over the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 88-year-old male presented to our emergency department (ED) with an acute onset of a painless loss of vision to his right eye. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (on apixaban). He stated he was lying in bed reading when he had a sudden painless loss of vision to his right eye, described as a curtain closing, for which he presented to our ED ~24 h later. He denied any other symptoms including headache, scalp pain, jaw claudication, focal weakness, numbness, angina or shortness of breath.\n\n【6】Vitals on arrival to the ED were as follows: 36.9°C, heart rate of 62 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, blood pressure of 123/53 mmHg and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. His cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. His neurologic exam was notable for a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of +2 for complete unilateral vision loss to the right eye. Intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg bilaterally. His remaining physical exam was notable for a right afferent pupillary defect (APD). To further assess the eye and its structures, a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was then performed. Utilizing the high-frequency linear probe to the right eye, a transverse view demonstrated a retrobulbar spot sign (RBSS) in the distal portion of the central retinal artery within the optic nerve sheath . He had normal blood flow in his left eye , and no blood flow was seen to the central retinal artery of the right eye, with the yellow arrow pointing to the RBSS . The patient was then transferred to our tertiary referral center (TRC) for specialist consultation.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Transverse view using the high-frequency linear probe of the right eye; arrow demonstrates RBSS within the optic nerve sheath.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Normal retinal blood flow in left eye; ( **b** ) CRAO with no blood flow seen to the central retinal artery or retina in right eye, yellow arrow highlights RBSS.</u>\n\n【9】Ophthalmology visualized a plaque on the dilated fundoscopic exam with associated retinal ischemia. Given the onset of ~24 h prior to arrival, the risks of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) outweighed the benefits, as such, the patient was medically managed. His head computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable for acute changes. A magnetic resonance imaging MRI could not be done, secondary to his pacemaker not being compatible. His carotid duplex was without severe stenosis or thrombus. His echocardiography showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, which was similar to previous studies.\n\n【10】Overall, his workup was without evidence of carotid artery disease or vasculitis and it was suspected to be cardioembolic in origin related to his atrial fibrillation. On further questioning, it was found that the patient’s family member had passed away 2 weeks prior, leading to depression and multiple missed doses of his anticoagulation. Compliance of his anticoagulation was stressed on discharge. At his 1-month follow-up after his hospital admission, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】A CRAO is a rare presentation in the ED; however, it is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis which requires a high index of clinical suspicion. The clinical presentation of a CRAO in the ED typically involves a patient with an acute, painless unilateral loss of vision, with the possibility of temporal sparing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The pertinent differential diagnoses for acute painless vision loss include optic neuritis, central retinal artery/vein occlusion, retinal detachment, temporal arteritis and atypical/complex migraines, to name a few. Optic neuritis may present with painful eye movements and temporal arteritis may have associated craniofacial pain despite the neuropathy being painless.\n\n【13】The ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies the central retinal artery. The central retinal artery provides blood supply to the inner retina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An acute occlusion of the central retinal artery results in ischemia to the inner retina, which may appear pale and edematous.\n\n【14】On the physical exam, patients may have an APD. A fundoscopic exam may show a ‘cherry red spot’, with a pale retina that is seen in ~90% of patients, or ‘box car segmentation’ that is seen in ~15% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For many causes of acute painless loss of vision in the ED, a dilated fundoscopic exam has been considered the gold standard. However, not many emergency physicians feel comfortable performing this, especially in a setting without ophthalmology coverage and with potentially limited resource settings. Alternatively, ultrasound (US) can provide a rapid and useful diagnostic tool.\n\n【15】A US of the eye can be performed at the bedside to evaluate for blood flow and for a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface. When this density is seen, this is referred to as the RBSS and can indicate the type of embolism responsible for clinical symptoms. This RBSS is the actual clot responsible for the loss of vision; it is likely a cholesterol and fibrin clot that occludes the ophthalmic artery and retinal blood supply 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. RBSS on US been seen in up to 51% of CRAOs and is found to have 100% specificity for thromboembolic CRAO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. When present, RBSS has been shown to have a poor long-term prognosis, and visual symptoms are poorly responsive to thrombolytics or other therapeutic interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. If an RBSS is not visualized, other etiologies for CRAO should be considered and evaluated. An ocular US can also be used to assess for blood flow in the central retinal artery and vein using color Doppler imaging. In the setting of CRAO, there will be reduced or no blood flow in the central retinal artery in the affected eye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. CRAO is considered a stroke-equivalent, so patients in the ED should undergo further evaluation and be admitted for risk factor modification.

Various maneuvers are often attempted for patients presenting within 24 h of symptom onset. Techniques include ocular massage (direct and intermittent pressure over a closed eyelid for 10–15 s at a time with a rapid release to facilitate a pressure gradient that could potentially dislodge any embolism) and anterior chamber paracentesis (this allows for an acute decrease in intraocular pressure that could dislodge any embolism). Medications include intraocular pressure lowering agents (topical timolol, intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol), vasodilatory agents (e.g. nitroglycerin) and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Overall, little data exist to show that any of the above methods will improve the patient outcomes compared with observation alone, with some evidence showing they may actually worsen the visual outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

An 80-year-old man with polyarthritis was diagnosed with seronegative RA in which rheumatoid factors and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides were not detected. He had multiple pulmonary nodules that diminished in size following treatment for RA, leading to the diagnosis of pulmonary rheumatoid nodules. During his treatment course, he developed scleritis, which could have resulted in blindness. As oral steroids did not improve his condition, topical steroid injections were administered, and his symptoms gradually improved. Here, we present a case of seronegative RA with an unusual combination of extra-articular manifestations: rheumatoid pulmonary nodules and scleritis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a generally good prognosis with few extra-articular symptoms, such as rheumatoid nodules and scleritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Here, we report a case of scleritis and multiple rheumatoid pulmonary nodules associated with seronegative RA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 80-year-old man was diagnosed with wrist and knee pain 2 years ago and was treated by a family care physician. Before 1 year, computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, and the patient underwent transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), which showed no evidence of tuberculosis, fungus, bacterial infection, vasculitis or malignancy. After 1 year, he was referred to our department following new onset of fever and finger joint pain.\n\n【6】He had symmetric polyarthritis with active synovitis affecting both the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints (> 12 joints). Laboratory findings were negative for RF and anti-CCP antibodies, but serum C-reactive protein levels were elevated. The patient fulfilled the classification criteria of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism and was diagnosed with seronegative RA. We performed TBLB for pulmonary nodules again; however, it did not reveal any findings suggesting malignancy and infection. The pulmonary nodules diminished after the treatment with prednisolone (PSL) 15 mg/day and methotrexate 12 mg/week for seronegative RA . Therefore, we speculated that these were rheumatoid nodules.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Chest CT showing multiple pulmonary nodules  on the first admission ( **a** ).

The patient had conjunctival injection , and optical coherence tomography showed retinal edema and diffuse thickening of the choroid . Furthermore, extravascular leakage was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography . Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with RA-associated scleritis complicated by uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Steroid eye drops were prescribed and the oral PSL dose was increased to 40 mg; however, the retinal edema worsened. We administered sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide (STTA) injection, which gradually improved his scleritis.

Scleritis is a rare extra-articular manifestation of RA with an incidence of 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Scleritis can be divided into anterior and posterior scleritis. Furthermore, anterior scleritis can be classified into three types; nodular, diffuse and necrotising. Our patient had diffuse anterior and posterior scleritis with uveitis and retinal edema. Scleral inflammation can involve the uvea and retina, leading to occlusion of the retinal vessels and optic edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If posterior scleritis without necrotising scleritis does not improve with systemic administration of steroids, then topical steroids (such as STTA) should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, the posterior scleritis, which did not improve with oral steroids, was successfully treated with STTA injections.\n\n【14】Rheumatoid nodules are common extra-articular manifestations of RA. However, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules are unusual, occurring in less than 1% of RA cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Differentiating rheumatoid nodules from other diseases, particularly malignancies, is challenging. Koslow reported six CT features more commonly associated with pulmonary rheumatoid nodules than with malignant tumors: ≥4 nodules, peripheral location, cavitation, satellite nodules, smooth border and subpleural rind 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient had three CT findings (≥4 nodules, peripheral location and satellite nodules), which indicated that rheumatoid nodules were more likely than malignancy. TBLB yielded no specific findings in the present case; however, we speculated that the pulmonary nodules were rheumatoid nodules based on clinical symptoms, CT findings and clinical course.\n\n【15】To the best of our knowledge, there have been no other case reports of seronegative RA with pulmonary rheumatoid nodules and scleritis. The relationship between seronegative RA and extra-articular manifestations has not been fully elucidated. Case reports on extra-articular manifestations of seronegative RA are scarce, and we hope that the accumulation of cases will lead to further understanding of seronegative RA.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required based on the Journal Policies.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written informed consent prior to the inclusion of his data in this report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>F.S. is the guarantor for this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Rhinoscopy showed a large nasal septum perforation. Nasal endoscopy revealed extensive necrosis and scabs. A computed tomography sinuses confirmed the presence of a nasal septum perforation .

In this report, we describe a case of large-vessel cerebrovascular thrombus in a therapeutically anticoagulated 89-year-old male admitted with COVID-19 infection. Despite clinical improvement following COVID-19 pneumonitis, symptoms of an acute left-sided total anterior circulation stroke rapidly developed 10 days after initial COVID-19 symptom onset. Computed tomography angiography imaging confirmed acute large-vessel thrombus in the terminal segment of the internal carotid artery resulting in acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Thromboembolic events in the context of COVID-19 infection have recently been described in critically unwell patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of large-vessel thrombus in a patient with COVID-19 infection receiving concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n【2】stroke , neuroimaging , neurology\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】A hypercoagulable state and propensity for thromboembolic disease have been increasingly described in recent reports of patients with COVID-19 infection, yet the exact mechanism driving this remains unclear. Recent discussions in the medical community have focused on the importance of prophylactic anticoagulation where appropriate to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. This report highlights the case of a hospitalized patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who suffered a large-vessel acute thromboembolic stroke despite concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation. It suggests that in those who experience a profound systemic inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there may be an increased risk of prothrombotic events, which may not be entirely attenuated by anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 89-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of worsening dyspnoea and cough. Past history included hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, permanent pacemaker implantation for complete heart block, chronic kidney disease stage 3 and atrial fibrillation. He was taking long-term Rivaroxaban therapy for stroke and systemic embolism prophylaxis. No compliance issues were reported. No antiplatelet or additional antithrombotic medication was being taken prior to hospital admission. Despite advanced age, the gentleman was fully independent with activities of daily living. Hospital admission was required due to hypoxia. Maximal oxygen requirements during the course of admission were 4 l/min. Reverse transcriptase viral polymerase chain reaction testing subsequently confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\n【7】Admission blood testing demonstrated lymphopenia (0.82 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein of 345 mg/l. Coagulation studies were prolonged (activated partial thromboplastin time 31.7 s, prothrombin time 14.4 s) due to concurrent anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban. Fibrinogen level was markedly elevated at 9 g/l. Creatinine (106 μmol/l) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (52 ml/min) were at the patient’s baseline level. Remaining biochemistry results returned within normal limits. Chest radiography confirmed new bi-basal and peripheral left mid zone pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonitis . Oral doxycycline was commenced to cover for possible secondary superadded bacterial infection, in line with local institutional protocols during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography demonstrating bi-basal and peripheral left mid zone pulmonary infiltrates and previous left-sided dual chamber permanent pacemaker (with capped and buried right ventricular lead).</u>\n\n【9】On Day 4 of his hospital stay, and despite an improvement in COVID-19 symptoms with reducing oxygen requirements, the patient developed a rapid and dense left-sided hemiplegia with dysarthria, alongside clinical signs of left gaze palsy and left homonymous hemianopia. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 21, signifying symptoms suggestive of acute severe stroke. Within 1 h of onset of neurological symptoms (Day 4 of hospital admission), computed tomography imaging of the brain was performed. This showed a region of low attenuation in the right basal ganglia and high density in the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery consistent with an acute infarct due to large-vessel occlusion . Computed tomography angiography was requested to evaluate a potential target for mechanical thrombectomy. This demonstrated extensive thrombus occluding the right cervical internal carotid artery and a T occlusion affecting the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography of the brain showing low attenuation in the right basal ganglia and high density in the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography demonstrating thrombus occluding the right middle cerebral artery.</u>\n\n【12】The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy due to concurrent anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban. Mechanical thrombectomy was discussed with interventional radiology colleagues, but it was decided that this would offer little clinical benefit given the patient’s age and comorbid status. Unfortunately, despite maximal ward-based medical treatment, the patient deteriorated and passed away 5 days later.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】This report describes a novel case of large-vessel thrombotic stroke in a recovering COVID-19-positive patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. Emerging evidence suggests the presence of a hypercoagulable state in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, especially those hospitalized with severe illness and strong clinical risk factors for Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recent case series has described large-vessel strokes in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and even thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients despite concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The exact pathophysiology is currently unknown, but it is hypothesized that hypoxia, immobility, excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and diffuse intravascular coagulation could all contribute to these clinically significant events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most have been observed in critically ill patients, with a recent observational study reporting 31% of 184 patients developing thromboembolic disease during intensive care unit stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although this report cannot confirm a causal relationship between COVID-19 infection and large-vessel thrombotic stroke due to the presence of other competing vascular risk factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation), it does offer further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of thrombotic events such as stroke. Additionally, the timing of these events may be unpredictable and unrelated to peak COVID-19 disease severity. Given the acute cerebrovascular event occurred 9 days following symptom onset in this case (not accounting for pre-symptomatic phase of COVID-19), it could be speculated that thromboembolism may be more common in the second half of the COVID-19 disease course (Day 10 onwards), when a systemic inflammatory response reaction has been demonstrated to predominate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this case, the presence of both an elevated C-reactive protein and fibrinogen supports this assertion.\n\n【16】Nevertheless, despite this gentleman receiving concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of systemic thromboembolism, this does not appear to have sufficiently attenuated the increased thromboembolic risk posed by COVID-19 infection. Perhaps, there may be value in screening biochemistry and coagulation studies (possibly at point of admission) to risk stratify and identify those patients at highest risk for subsequent events. Elevated D-dimer levels have been shown to predict future mortality in COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, but a threshold for prediction of thromboembolism has yet be clearly defined. Fibrinogen levels could also be used as a method of prognostication to inform clinical management. Although there are no data in COVID-19 patients, previous studies have demonstrated that elevated fibrinogen levels are predictive of vascular events, including stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Recent reports have proposed higher dose thromboprophylaxis therapy to be used in patients with COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. However, despite some institutions introducing these regimens into local protocols, there remains no randomized data to support a definitive conclusion and to suggest the superiority of one strategy versus another (low molecular weight heparin vs. Vitamin K antagonist vs. direct oral anticoagulant). A perceived protection against thromboembolism needs to be balanced against increased bleeding risk, including intracranial haemorrhage, in these patients. Randomized studies to establish the benefits, or not, of biomarker screening to predict the risk of thromboembolism, and varying anticoagulation strategies, are required to inform best clinical practice in the COVID-19 era.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of interest statement_ .

This case highlights strengths of focused cardiac ultrasound in critical care setting and in patients with COVID-19 when access to other imaging modalities can be limited.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】We present a patient with COVID-19 infection presenting with respiratory failure and shock. Our case report highlights the strengths of focused cardiac ultrasound in differential diagnosis of shock and paradoxical embolism, especially valuable in patients with COVID-19 when access to other imaging modalities can be limited.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with the history of hypertension presented to the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic with significant shortness of breath on minimal exertion and fatigue for 3 weeks. Patient was hypoxic to 74% and tachypneic to 30 breaths/min and required endotracheal intubation. Physical exam was unremarkable. Shortly, thereafter, she became persistently hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with rate of 70 bpm, tall R wave in V2 and symmetric T wave inversions in precordial leads . Chest radiograph post intubation showed bilateral patchy infiltrates. Initial severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test was negative while the second PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done 24 h later returned positive.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Initial electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with rate of 70 bpm, tall R wave in V2 and symmetric T wave inversions in precordial leads.</u>\n\n【7】Initial troponin T was 0.07 ng/ml with maximum at 0.22 ng/ml (reference range < 0.01 ng/ml) and NT-proBNP was 12 945 pg/ml. Elevated white blood cell count (21.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl), creatinine (1.45 mg/dl), C-reactive protein (25.9 mg/dl) and ferritin (546 ng/ml) and D- Dimer 4.34 (ref range ≤ 0.63 mg/l) was noted. Serial ECGs remained stable.\n\n【8】Patient remained persistently hypoxic with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO2 ratio of 85 which along with CXR findings is suggestive of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Central venous oxygen saturation of 62% suggested the possibility of mixed shock.\n\n【9】Computed tomography angiogram of chest was deferred due to hemodynamic instability and refractory hypoxemia. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated. Due to institutional COVID-19 policy for transthoracic echocardiography to minimize personnel exposure, focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) was performed, which revealed mildly increased right ventricular cavity size with flattened septum in systole and diastole along with bowing of interatrial septum toward the left supporting ECG findings of right ventricular strain . Due to suspected massive pulmonary embolism (PE) alteplase 50 mg was given intravenously over 120 min. This resulted in significant improvement of hemodynamics, perfusion indices and oxygenation within next 12 h to the extent that hypotension resolved despite being on high PEEP protocol for ARDS.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Parasternal short-axis view demonstrating dilated right ventricle (star) with flattened septum (arrow).</u>\n\n【11】After 24 h, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite being off sedation. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of head revealed multifocal infarcts of both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres with associated mass effects concerning for acute ischemic infarcts. Follow-up CT in 12 h revealed hemorrhagic transformation and anticoagulation with heparin was held. Due to concern for cardioembolic phenomenon, FoCUS with agitated saline was done that showed early right to left shunt consistent with patent foramen ovale (PFO) . Doppler ultrasound of legs did not reveal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). No evidence of atrial fibrillation was noted on prolonged cardiac monitoring. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome workup was negative.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Apical four chamber view with early right to left shunt by agitated saline study.</u>\n\n【13】Patient remained intubated for 20 days due to poor mental status but was eventually successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation.

Distributive shock from inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is common, but other types of shock including cardiogenic, obstructive (including tamponade and tension pneumothorax), as well as mixed shock should be considered. Myopericarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infraction (MI) should be in the differential for cardiogenic shock in such patients. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose obstructive shock from PE given significant hypoxemia in severe COVID-19 cases due to ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Classic ECG changes of right ventricular strain S1Q3T3 are insensitive. On the other hand, simultaneous T wave inversions in inferior and precordial leads with maximum amplitude of T wave in V1–V2 was previously reported, as sign of PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Hypercoagulability, both in macro and microvascular circulation, is important contributor to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, and our understanding of the disease is evolving rapidly. Macro-thrombotic events including acute MI, acute limb ischemia, stoke, DVT, PE as well as pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy with micro-thrombotic complications are described in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis of these grave thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes substantially.\n\n【19】COVID-19 pandemic created a situation wherein healthcare workers safety and highest care to patients must be in delicate balance. Multiple institutions including American Society of Echocardiography implemented new policies to change use criteria and protocols for different imaging modalities to limit exposure of healthcare workers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. FoCUS is valuable bedside tool and able to provide information on left and right ventricular systolic function, valvular abnormalities, pericardial effusion and volume status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are only limited reports on echocardiography and FoCUS use in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Study by European Association of cardiovascular imaging showed 55% of patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal echocardiography results which changed the management in one-third of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In a smaller study of 91 suspected or known COVID-19 patients, sonographers spent significantly less time using handheld ultrasound but still provided sufficient information for clinical team 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The major limitation of FOCUS is the diagnostic accuracy is dependent on the operator’s skills.\n\n【20】In our case, FoCUS was not only used for diagnosis of massive PE but also to diagnose the large interatrial shunt. Prompt diagnosis of massive PE and appropriate thrombolysis dramatically improved hemodynamics and oxygenation. Although stroke can be explained by prothrombotic state in COVID-19, embolic origin, particularly paradoxical embolism, needs to be ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. FoCUS with agitated saline confirmed the diagnosis of interatrial right to left shunting as route for paradoxical embolism.\n\n【21】To conclude, FoCUS facilitated diagnosis of massive pulmonary thromboembolism and interatrial shunt that guided clinical management. High clinical suspicion for thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients is required for prompt diagnosis. FoCUS is a helpful tool readily available at bedside with advantage of limiting exposure of healthcare workers.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Stuart Zarich MD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There are increasing reports associating chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin with prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias (monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) in COVID-19 patients. We present the case of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-infected kidney transplant patient for which he received treatment with chloroquine plus azithromycin and on Day 4 of therapy, the patient suddenly developed a wide complex tachycardia. Because of the increasing reports of adverse effects related to these drugs, their use should be avoided until further evidence of clinical benefit is available.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. The aminoquinoline drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have received worldwide attention as potential therapies. Optimism for repurposing these drugs stems from two lines of evidence: inhibition of coronaviridae (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) _in vitro_ and an open-label non-randomized study that involved treatment using hydroxychloroquine (combined in some patients with azithromycin, an azalide antibiotic with putative antiviral properties) that reported improved virologic clearance in the intervention group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Regimens employed vary but are generally equivalent to 400–1200 mg hydroxychloroquine (250–1000 mg chloroquine) per day for ~5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, both agents can cause rare and serious adverse effects (<10%), including corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, hypoglycemia, neuropsychiatric effects and retinopathy. The potential risk of arrhythmias must be monitored, especially in critically ill patients and in those taking concomitant QT interval prolonging medications such as azithromycin and fluoroquinolones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The safety profile of these drugs in the context of COVID-19 patients is still unknown, although there are increasing reports of adverse effects with this treatment. In this regard, we present the case of a patient with COVID-19 treated with chloroquine plus azithromycin who developed a sudden episode of wide complex tachycardia (WCT).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Wide complex tachycardia presented in the patient.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|The rhythm following pharmacologic cardioversion.</u>\n\n【6】CASE\n----\n\n【7】A 43-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department due to intermittent fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea started a week ago. He had a 24-year history of hypertension and chronic renal disease due to non-specific glomerulonephritis, receiving a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor 6 months ago and surgical parathyroidectomy due to tertiary hyperparathyroidism. His medications were nifedipine 30 mg twice daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, mycophenolic acid 500 mg twice daily, tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily, prednisone 25 mg/day, calcium carbonate 4 g/day and calcitriol 0.25 mcg/day. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, shortness of breath and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation level of 83% (room air). Relevant laboratory findings were leucopenia (1980 mm <sup>3 </sup> , normal range \\[NR\\] 4000–10 000 mm <sup>3 </sup> ), lymphopenia (0.200 mm <sup>3 </sup> , NR 0.600–3400 mm3) and lactate dehydrogenase 981 U/L (NR 240–480 U/L); Serum electrolytes were normal: sodium 136 mmol/L (NR 136–145 mmol/L), potassium 4.1 mmol/L (NR 3.5–5.1 mmol/L), magnesium 1.8 mg/dl (NR 1.6–2.5 mg/dl), calcium 8.8 mg/dl (8.6–10.2 mg/dl), phosphorus 3.91 mg/dl (NR 2.7–4.5 mg/dl). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph showed bilateral ground glass image. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction with nasopharyngeal swab was positive.\n\n【8】The patient was classified as COVID-19 severe disease according to World Health Organization classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and was transferred to the department of Internal Medicine where he was evaluated to select the management as follows: the QTc of the baseline ECG was calculated manually using the Bazett formula, being 410 ms (NR 350–480 ms), and a validated risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients was performed, by which he was classified as ‘low risk’ (6 points) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, a standard regimen with chloroquine plus azithromycin was started (chloroquine 500 mg twice on day 1, then 500 mg daily on Days 2–5 plus azithromycin 500 mg daily on Day 1, then 250 mg daily on Days 2–5). An informed consent for the treatment was obtained according to the institutional standards. However, on Day 4 of therapy, the patient suddenly developed a fast-WCT at 180 beats/min, managed as ventricular tachycardia (VT) with amiodarone 300 mg IV. Unfortunately, it was not possible to record the complete 12 lead ECG, only a DII rhythm strip. A close inspection showed possible atrio-ventricular dissociation  that suggests the diagnosis of VT. The rhythm following cardioversion 5 min after starting amiodarone infusion was visualized with a DII rhythm strip, which showed an irregular rhythm, QRS 110 ms at 100 beats/min on average with biphasic T waves with ST-segment depression, without organized atrial activity, suggesting atrial fibrillation. There was no evidence of prolonged QT . A measurement of troponin I was obtained during the arrhythmia episode, which was 0.2 ng/dl (NR 0.0–0.6 ng/dl). Laboratory tests obtained on the same day (prior to the arrhythmia episode) were not relevant to explain the event (leucocytes 2050 mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophils 1790 mm <sup>3 </sup> , lymphocytes 0.110 mm <sup>3 </sup> , sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.26 mmol/L, magnesium 1.7 mg/dl, calcium 9.1 mg/dl, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dl). A Cardiology Service consultation was requested; unfortunately, the patient presented a cardiac arrest (50 min after pharmacological cardioversion) without response to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and died.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】The use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently supported primarily by _in vitro_ and weak studies involving humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are being used internationally off-label to treat patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While multiple studies are planned or underway, the current evidence about the benefit is very uncertain and on the other hand, information regarding possible harms is on the rise. In fact, both drugs are listed as definite causes of torsade de pointes at crediblemeds.org , thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes and drug induced-sudden cardiac death. In a retrospective study that included 251 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the treatment with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on Day 1, then 400 mg daily on Days 2–5) along with azithromycin (500 mg daily for 5 days) was associated with a prolonged QTc of ≥500 ms (a known marker of high-risk malignant arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death) in 23% of cases and with a torsade de pointes in one patient (estimated incidence at 0.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In perspective, this is 4 times the estimated incidence of single infusion of IV sotalol induced torsade de pointes (0.1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In the present case, although we were unable to get a 12 lead ECG, we considered that the WTC was very likely a monomorphic VT based on the analysis of the DII rhythm strip. We hypothesize that such condition was possibly related to the combined chloroquine/azithromycin therapy along with the previously described associated medical conditions. The appearance of VT (without torsade de pointes) has been described in two patients who received high doses of chloroquine (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although the dose of chloroquine was lower in the case presented, it is possible that the simultaneous use of azithromycin and tacrolimus (another medication with known capacity to increase QTc) had had a synergistic cardiotoxic effect. Another factor to consider is a possible myocarditis. Myocardial injury with elevated troponin levels occurs in 20–30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with higher rates (55%) among those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Myocarditis is a potential mechanism that could result in arrhythmogenesis among COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the present case, the patient did not present with elevated troponins suggesting myocarditis. However, in autopsy cases, myocardial viral activity in the absence of evidence of myocarditis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Therefore, we speculate that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiomyocyte could result in alteration of signaling pathways that, together with proarrhythmogenic drugs, generated the arrythmia in this patient.\n\n【12】In conclusion, due to the absence of clinical benefit on morbidity and mortality with the use of antimalarials or azithromycin or the combination of both drugs in patients with COVID-19, and given the increase in reports of adverse effects related to these drugs, their use should be avoided until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy is available.\n\n【13】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Informed consent for publication has been obtained from the authorized representative of the patient, in line with the COPE best practice guidelines.\n\n【15】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【16】The authors declared no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

His clinical course was complicated by a large aortic root abscess not initially visualised on transthoracic echocardiography or computerised tomography. The cardinal feature of progressive prolongation of the PR interval on serial electrocardiograms was the only sign associated with clinical deterioration and was the trigger for rapid investigation and urgent management. Our case emphasises the importance of simple bedside tests to identify dynamic clinical scenarios and the requirement for early further imaging in the management of IE.\n\n【2】Cardiothoracic Surgery\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】The Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella (HACEK) group is a collection of gram-negative coccobacillary organisms which are components of the normal flora of the oropharynx. _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus_ is a member of the HACEK group; a haemophilus species. It is a rare cause of infective endocarditis (IE), more commonly seen in patients with immunosuppression, congenital heart disease and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We present a case of a rapidly evolving catastrophic aortic root abscess following _A. aphrophilus_ infection, initially suspected following progressive electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. This case emphasises the simple tests every doctor must be cognisant of, especially when the diagnosis is unclear.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 25-year-old male was admitted for elective aortic and pulmonary valve replacement. On admission, he was found to have a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 102 mg/l with normal white cell count. His past medical history was significant for congenital heart disease with a true bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortopathy. He was asymptomatic as a child and remained under surveillance for gradual worsening of his aortic stenosis until undergoing balloon dilatation aged 9, followed by a Ross procedure aged 15 for severe stenosis. He developed progressive aortic root dilation and underwent a redo operation with a Bentall procedure using a 29-mm Perimount prosthesis aged 20. He remained asymptomatic over the following years, until recent echocardiographic surveillance showed development of severe aortic stenosis and mixed disease of the right ventricle–pulmonary artery (RV–PA) homograft, prompting admission for elective surgical intervention.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Initial TTE showing no evidence of para-aortic collection ( **A** ) parasternal long-axis view, ( **B** ) short-axis view with colour Doppler.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|ECGs showing progressive significant increase in PR interval on admission ( **A** ) PR = 158 ms, compared with Day 5 ( **B** ) increased to 292 ms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|TOE showing the large vacuolated aortic root abscess ( **A** ) four-chamber view, ( **B** ) at 61°, ( **C** ) 133° with colour Doppler, ( **D** ) 61° short axis, ( **E** ) 130° short axis with colour Doppler showing systolic flow through the abscess indicating fistula formation with the aortic root, ( **F** ) 61° Short axis with colour Doppler showing the communication of the aortic root abscess to the aortic root.</u>\n\n【10】On admission the patient reported to feeling well, aside from recent flu-like illness which had resolved a week prior. At that time, he had been feeling feverish with myalgia and a non-productive cough. He denied any localising symptoms and his observations were all within normal limits. His physical examination was normal, barring the expected ejection systolic and early diastolic murmurs, with no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. On the day of admission, he underwent a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the aorta in preparation for surgery, which included views of the chest and abdomen. Review of this scan revealed no focus of infection, or para-aortic collections. His urine dipstick and respiratory viral PCR screen were both negative.\n\n【11】While awaiting surgery, he began to clinically deteriorate with tachycardia and fevers. Repeated transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no obvious independently mobile structures on the valves, however due to the extent of degenerative changes of the valve it was difficult to fully exclude vegetations . The patient’s CRP continued to rise over the next 2 days and his blood cultures came back positive for _A. aphrophilus_ .\n\n【12】He was started on Ceftriaxone and Gentamycin, however by Day 5 his CRP had climbed to 317 mg/l with a white cell count of 12.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> g/l and he remained pyrexial. Most significantly, his ECGs showed progressive prolongation of PR interval  from a baseline of 158 to 292 ms. The daily progressive PR interval prolongation was highly suspicious of aortic root abscess formation and triggered urgent further imaging. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed a large echo-dense structure around the aortic root extending posteriorly towards the left atrium. Several small cavities were seen in the mass with blood flow and communication between the cavity and the aortic root . There was also localised extension of the abscess border into the left atrium with potential risk of rupture. Repeat CT was carried out which showed an increase in low attenuation material around the aortic root with two new regions of internal contrast extravasation. This was in keeping with aortic root abscess at the level of the aortic prosthesis with extension into the roof of the left atrium .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|White arrows on CT showing expanding aortic root abscess ( **A** ) short-axis view, ( **B** ) rendered reconstruction. AO = Aorta.</u>\n\n【14】He was taken urgently to theatre for debridement and redo-Bentall operation with a mechanical aortic valve and replacement of the RV to PA conduit. Explanted tissue did not grow anything at culture, but 16S rDNA PCR screen was positive and seq1 PCR detected _A. aphrophilus._ He had an uncomplicated recovery post-operatively and was treated with a further 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics with appropriate normalisation of his CRP. Antibiotic treatment was changed to oral Ciprofloxacin and completed a total of course of 6 weeks. He remained well since stopping antibiotics with no further fevers and normal CRP.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This case highlights the importance of basic tests and investigations in the management of IE. Daily ECGs in IE are often overlooked but progressive PR prolongation was an early sign of worsening underlying pathology and a trigger for urgent action in this case. Aortic root abscesses are a rare but life-threatening complication of IE, predominantly associated with aortic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PR prolongation occurs with aortic root abscesses due to the proximity of the cardiac conduction system. The atrioventricular node sits at the base of the atrial septum with the non-penetrating His bundle travelling along the membranous septum to become the penetrating bundle, passing though the central fibrous body at the apex of the triangle of Koch and directly into the left ventricular outflow tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This pathway takes the conduction system directly beneath the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary aortic leaflets, as well as in close relation to the mitral and tricuspid valves.\n\n【17】The importance of taking multiple blood cultures is also highlighted. Our patient had five sets of blood cultures before being started on antibiotic therapy, two of which were negative at 7 days of incubation. The HACEK group is notoriously difficult to culture and often require prolonged incubation or analysis using DNA PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Clinical examination showed negative results, while abdominal ultrasound revealed a 16-mm right pyelic stone. Urinalysis performed on 12 December 2020 revealed leukocyturia and microhematuria. On 16 February 2021, the consentient patient underwent ESWL. The early post-operative course was uneventful. Thirty-six hours after the procedure, she experienced a fever with rigor and chills and progressive onset of lumbar pain. Home therapy with oral cefixime was unsuccessful, and she was re-admitted to the hospital 7 days after ESWL (23 February 2021). Increased white blood cells (11 600/μl), serum procalcitonin (19.84 ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (14.72 mg/dl) were detected. Hemoculture was positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing _Escherichia coli_ , resistant to beta-lactamine and ciprofloxacin. Abdominal computerized tomography showed the unmodified stone. Hydronephrosis was not detected. Intravenous perfusion of gentamycin and co-trimoxazole allowed resolution of the sepsis in 5 days. The patient continued to take oral co-trimoxazole for a week after hospital discharge. In the meantime, the lumbar pain increased in intensity, which led her to consult a neurosurgeon at our university hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (23 February 2021) showed spondylodiscitis at levels L3, L4, L5 , which was treated with a cycle of parenteral antibiotics according to the modality described above. The patient was also fitted with an orthopedic brace, which gave complete relief of pain in 1 month. She was made aware of the possible occurrence over time of clinical and imaging features of lumbar stenosis as a consequence of vertebral and discs post-spondylodiscitis deformity. Weight loss and swimming were recommended. Eighteen months after ESWL, the patient was asymptomatic and presented only a modest limitation of lumbar spine motility. Regarding the stone, the patient, free from colic, refused to undergo retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging obtained 2 weeks after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for kidney stones complicated by _Escherichia coli_ septicemia.

Here, we report a case of keratitis caused by multi-drug-resistant _S. algae_ that was not related to a marine environment.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 66-year-old man was sent to the emergency department from a nursing hospital because of desaturation. He had been hospitalized for more than 2 years in an unconscious state due to a cervical spine injury. He was unable to close his eyes voluntarily. Neither the patient nor his family had a history of marine exposure. At admission, pneumonia was suspected, and conjunctival injection, purulent discharge and central white opacity were detected in his right eye. He was admitted to the respiratory department, and treatment with piperacillin–tazobactam was started for pneumonia. An ophthalmologist examined the patient at the bedside. Examination of his right eye revealed 6.0 × 5.0 mm corneal opacity and hyphema with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination was impossible due to corneal haziness. Corneal swabs were sent for Gram staining, bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing, KOH mount smear and fungal culture. Empirical treatment with tobramycin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin eye drops was started. The KOH smear and Gram stain were negative. After a 2-day incubation, medium-sized gray and dark pink colonies grew on blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . Other types of colony did not grow on the plate. _S. algae_ was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Vitek system (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). 16S rRNA sequencing revealed 99.93% (1410/1411 bp) identity with _S. algae_ JCM 21037(T) (GenBank accession number BALO01000089 ). Susceptibility testing of the isolate indicated susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, colistin and gentamicin, resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and intermediate to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and meropenem. We added steroid eye drops to control the inflammation and continued the antibiotic eye drops. After 14 days, his keratitis had improved.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|_Shewanella algae_ colonies grown on chocolate (left) and blood (right) agar plates.</u>\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n【11】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n【15】Open in new tab\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Microbial keratitis is inflammation of the cornea caused by bacteria, fungi, or protists. The main causative bacteria are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Serratia_ species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Bacterial keratitis caused by _Shewanella_ species is extremely rare. Only one case of _S. algae_ infection has been reported worldwide; this was in the USA in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In Korea, there has been one case of _S. algae_ endophthalmitis but no reported keratitis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We report the second case of _S. algae_ keratitis worldwide and the first in Asia. Colonies of _Shewanella_ species on medium are convex, circular, and smooth and produce an unusual brown to tan pigment, in contrast to the white colonies of the major keratitis pathogens _S. aureus_ and _P. aeruginosa_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The colonies we observed were also medium-sized circular smooth colonies that were dark pink to brown on both blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . This should inform clinicians of the unusual colony morphology, which differs from that of the major keratitis pathogens observed in clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\n【18】This case has two exceptional aspects. First, the isolate was resistant to multiple drugs. There are no criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of _Shewanella_ species in international guidelines, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Therefore, we used the criteria for _P. aeruginosa_ , which is a related strain. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenem and intermediate to quinolone, which shows more resistant tendency than previous reported isolates. In a 2013 review of 239 cases since 1973, 82%, 94%, 94% and 98% of _Shewanella_ species were susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, _S. algae_ was multi-drug resistant, rendering it difficult to treat, which can lead to treatment failure. Furthermore, the types of antibiotics that can be used in eye drops are limited, decreasing the treatment options.\n\n【19】Second, the patient had no history of seawater exposure. _Shewanella_ infections are often associated with marine exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Our patient had been hospitalized in a nursing hospital for more than 2 years, and his family had no relation to the sea. Consequently, we did not suspect _S. algae_ infection in this patient sooner. It is necessary to consider whether there are _S. algae_ infection routes other than marine exposure. We did not perform other culture such as stool culture, therefore it was not possible to confirm that _S. algae_ existed in the patient as colonization. Although _S. algae_ mainly inhabit the marine environment, there is a possibility of infection even if the patient did not have marine exposure. _S. algae_ is found naturally in wildlife including seawater as well as soil, fish, meat, and dairy product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There have been several cases of eye infections without marine exposure in previously published reports . Although no other investigation has been conducted to find the source of the infection, it should be thought that various environment including care giving staff and ingestion of seafood also can be the sources of infection.\n\n【20】As in this case, clinical isolates can be extremely rare species with high levels of drug resistance and can involve an atypical patient history. For best clinical practice, clinicians need to keep an eye on the laboratory results after ordering cultures.\n\n【21】This is the second report of bacterial keratitis caused by multi-drug resistant _S. algae_ worldwide and the first in Asia. Clinicians must track microbiology test results to determine appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive specific funding.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained in written format from the patient’s family for clinical information to be reported in the journal.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>J.C. and J.E.S.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It leads to a serious form of chronic viral hepatitis and accelerated liver-related morbidity and mortality including hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment regimes propose Pegylated interferon-alpha for 48 weeks however sustained virological response (SVR) rates remain low. We report a patient who initially responded to Pegylated interferon treatment for HBV-HDV co-infection. Although initial improvement in viraemia from both virsues was seen, SVR was not achieved with ongoing progression of liver injury biochemically. However, the summative effect of a second course of Pegylated interferon 2 years later led to HDV cure (SVR 12 months post-treatment), very low level HBV carrier status (with persistently undetectable viral load) and ongoing biochemical normalization. This case illustrates a successful treatment strategy for persistent HBV-HDV co-infection where proposed treatment regimes elicit an initial response but SVR is not achieved.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hepatitis delta infection is caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV) which requires the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, Hepatitis delta infection is either acquired simultaneously with, or as a superinfection to, existing HBV. Transmission routes are the same as for HBV, including percutaneous and sexual contact with blood products that are infected (and rarely vertical transmission from mother to child). Acute simultaneous HDV-HBV co-infection causes a hepatitis ranging in severity from mild to fulminant, however a complete recovery is usually seen, and <5% progress to chronic. In contrast, HDV superinfection on a background of established chronic HBV carries a much poorer prognosis in up to 90% of cases, accelerating the development of cirrhosis by almost a decade compared with chronic HBV alone.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Hepatitis B and D viral loads over time.</u>\n\n【5】HDV-HBV co-infection is seen in at least 5% of chronic HBV cases worldwide resulting in >15–20 million estimated cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, although this is thought to be an underestimation of the true prevalence. However, following a global vaccination programme for HBV, the overall number of HDV cases has decreased over the last four decades.\n\n【6】HDV-HBV co-infection is regarded as the most serious form of chronic viral hepatitis, leading to accelerated liver-related morbidity and mortality including hepatocellular carcinoma.

He did not drink alcohol or have any risk factors for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Subsequent investigations revealed a diagnosis of HBV-HDV co-infection, and histopathology was consistent with advanced fibrosis (Ishak stage 5) with severe portal inflammation. Viral loads of both viruses were detectable with HBV DNA of 39 iU/ml (e-antigen negative/e-antibody positive at presentation) and a rising HDV RNA of 6.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml going up to 8.8 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml.\n\n【10】Treatment with Pegylated interferon-alpha 3 was initiated in April 2014, and an initial encouraging response was documented with HDV RNA down to 220 iU/ml after 14 weeks of treatment. After 6 months, HBV DNA was undetectable and after 8 months, HDV RNA was also undetectable. The patient completed 12 months of treatment before unfortunately being lost to follow up and therefore SVR was not assessed.\n\n【11】Two years later, aged 45, he presented to Luton & Dunstable University hospital with a transaminitis (ALT 61). Although the liver looked radiologically unremarkable, a subsequent Fibroscan indicated F2 fibrosis (7.2 kPa). In addition, viral loads of both viruses had become detectable again (HDV RNA 77 iU/ml, HBV DNA 30 iU/ml). The suspicion that both viruses working in tandem were causing progressive liver damage prompted treatment with a second course of Pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (Pegasys).\n\n【12】Following this second course (which the patient stopped at 6 months due to non-compliance) he was essentially cured of his Hepatitis delta infection (HDV RNA undetectable, HDV IgM negative) with an SVR 12 months after completion of treatment . Furthermore, although Hepatitis B surface antigen remains positive and therefore functional cure has not been achieved, he became a very low level chronic HBV carrier (HBV DNA undetectable) as a result of the treatment. Finally, persistent biochemical normalization has been achieved.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】This is an interesting case because although the initial full course of treatment improved viraemia from both viruses, SVR was not achieved with persistent infection re-presenting as a transaminitis with Fibroscan evidence of ongoing fibrosis. Of note, advanced fibrosis was diagnosed histologically just 3 years prior to the Fibroscan which indicated F2 fibrosis in 2017. This may indicate improvement in fibrosis following initial treatment course (taking the differences in diagnostic modality into consideration), or may be as a result of potential overstating of fibrosis histologically (taking into account the significant improvement in fibrosis over only 3 years as indicated by the histology and subsequent Fibroscan). However, the summative effect of the second course, albeit for a subtherapeutic duration, appears to have achieved very low level HBV carrier status (with persistently undetectable viral load) and Hepatitis delta infection cure as well as biochemical normalisation.\n\n【15】A case described in the literature describes how functional cure of chronic HBV (with HBsAg clearance) as well as SVR of HDV infection was achieved after 12 years of treatment with interferon-alpha 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, subsequent literature including a meta-analysis comparing interferon-alpha, lamivudine and pegylated interferon-alpha for the treatment of HBV-HDV co-infection concluded that pegylated interferon-alpha led to superior SVR rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Two subsequent studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u> highlighted that longer courses of Pegylated interferon have superior SVR rates, however treatment is generally poorly tolerated, which is likely to impact compliance with longer courses. Furthermore, there is still a significant proportion of patients who do not achieve SVR after initial response to treatment with Pegylated interferon despite length of treatment as highlighted by these studies.\n\n【16】Although research into a superior therapy for HDV-HBV co-infection is ongoing, the lack of enzymatic proteins to target in the HDV means that conventional antiviral therapy has limited efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This case illustrates the cumulative effect of a ‘double hit’ of Pegylated interferon-alpha treatment as a successful treatment strategy for persistent HBV-HDV co-infection in patients who do not achieve SVR following initial treatment until a superior management option becomes available.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval is not required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Meha Bhuva.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sambit Sen.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgments.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe a rare case of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the neck and the node surrounding the cystic duct of the gallbladder. A 33-year-old female presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain aggravated after fat meals. The diagnosis was made as chronic cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Pathologic examination showed a lobulated nodule connected to the cystic duct. Microscopically, this node consisted of all components of pancreatic tissue. Localization of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gallbladder is exceedingly rare. Less than 40 cases of heterotopic pancreas in the gallbladder have been reported worldwide. The ectopic pancreas is an extraordinary congenital entity. Although pancreatic tissue in the lymph node is an exceptional finding, pathologists should be aware of it because it may be confused with tumor or metastasis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heterotopic pancreas (HP), also referred to as an ectopic pancreas, pancreatic rest and accessory pancreatic tissue is defined as the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue in an anatomic place with no communication with the main pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The most common sites of HP are the stomach, duodenum, colon and Meckel diverticulum. It can also be found uncommonly in the gallbladder, biliary tract, spleen, liver, mesentery, lung and pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The gallbladder is a very rare location that is involved by pancreatic rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The ectopic pancreas is usually an incidental and asymptomatic finding, but it may be present with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. In this report, we present a case of HP in the neck of the gallbladder and around its cystic duct.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\nA 33-year-old female presented to the emergency department at Tishreen University Hospital in 2021 with repeated attacks of right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the back and right shoulder and worsened by fatty meals. These symptoms persisted for 2 months before her admission to our hospital. The patient was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She had no previous surgery or allergy to any drugs. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the right upper quadrant with a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, WBC of 5.1 mm <sup>3 </sup> , serum amylase of 74 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–140)</u> and blood glucose of 85 mg/dL. Her liver and renal function tests revealed no abnormality. Abdomen ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and multiple gallstones in the lumen, the largest was 4.7 mm in diameter . Depending on the diagnosis of chronic calculous cholecystitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done. On pathological examination, the gallbladder measured 7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter with a wall thickness |$\\\\sim$| of 0.5 cm. The serosa was unremarkable. Gross inspection of the excised gallbladder showed a firm mass surrounding the cystic duct measuring 1.2 cm. After opening the specimen, another mass was found in the serosa of the neck region about 0.5 cm in diameter. Cut sections revealed well-circumscribed, yellow and lobulated nodules . The mucosa was intact, green and velvety. The H&E-stained sections showed an ectopic pancreatic tissue in the large mass, composed of lobules of exocrine pancreatic acini, ducts  and islets of Langerhans . On the other hand, only acini were seen in the serosa of the gallbladder . The apical area of acinar cells contained eosinophilic granules, whereas the basal region is markedly basophilic. Residual lymphatic tissue in the lymph node was not seen. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the same day, without any complications.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|An ultrasonographic image of the gallbladder showed wall thickening with multiple gallstones in the lumen.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Gross image of the excised gallbladder, cut section revealed a well-circumscribed, yellow nodule in the area of the cystic duct (black arrow) and a similar small nodule in the neck region of the gallbladder (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Microscopic images of the gallbladder.

HP can be occurred anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent locations are the stomach, duodenum and jejunum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. By contrast, the presence of ectopic pancreas in the esophagus, gallbladder, mesentery, spleen, mediastinum or fallopian tubes is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the gallbladder is an extremely rare site for the HP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The first reported case of HP in the gallbladder dates back to 1916 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Until the present study, >40 cases of HP in the gallbladder have been reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In most patients, this condition is an incidental finding on upper endoscopy or laparotomy and it is generally asymptomatic. However, it may be complicated by inflammation, bleeding, obstruction or malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The differential diagnosis of the enlargement of cystic duct lymph node includes cholecystitis, tuberculosis, ectopic tissue and lymphoma or metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our first diagnosis was reactive lymphadenopathy in context of chronic cholecystitis. The microscope examination showed ectopic pancreatic tissue with no residual lymphatic tissue. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of HP; the most widely accepted is that the tissue is separated from the pancreas gland during the rotation of the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The literature reported one case of HP in four lymph nodes around the common hepatic artery. The pathogenesis of HP in the lymph node is unclear. Two possibilities have been proposed; a failure during embryologic development or lymphatic migration of epithelial elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ectopic pancreatic tissue is usually located in the neck or fundus of the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Preoperative diagnosis is rarely clinically or radiologically possible because it is a very rare pathological entity, which diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, in addition to the neck, it has also been found in the cystic duct lymph node, which is considered a very exceptional site. Histologically, the ectopic pancreas can be complete heterotopia, similar to the normal pancreas, composed of exocrine acini, duct and islets of Langerhans, or incomplete heterotopia if the endocrine elements were absent. Based on microscopic findings, HP has been classified into three types by von Heinrich in 1909. Type 1: all components of pancreatic tissue (acini, ducts and islets of Langerhans) are present; Type 2: contains only a few acini and ducts, but lacks endocrine elements; Type 3: only proliferating excretory ducts with the absence of acini and islets cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. According to what was mentioned above, our case was considered to be complete heterotopia and Type 1 of the Heinrich classification.\n\n【11】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【12】Pancreatic heterotopia is an exceptional event especially when it is localized to the gallbladder. Although HP in the lymph node is unusual, pathologists should be aware of it because it may mimic tumor or metastasis.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required for this case report.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rabab Salloum.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Because one problem triggers a series of events that lead to further indications and symptoms, PRS is not regarded as a syndrome in and of itself but rather as a series of conditions. In the first trimester, mandibular hypoplasia, which can have an underlying condition or not, reduces the oropharyngeal space and causes the tongue to move upward and posteriorly, impairing the ability of the palate to close and obstructing the hypopharynx 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. We present a case of a PRS-related anatomical anomaly that hindered attempts to manage the airway and the final approach that made it possible to insert an endotracheal tube (ETT). We describe the use of a flexible fiberoptic video-ureteroscope,  as an alternative to a bronchoscope, for airway management.

He had agnathia, glossoptosis and cleft palate. The patient was a preterm child born by normal delivery at 34 weeks of gestation to a middle-class family of south Asian ethnicity. Upon admission, he developed cyanosis with an arterial saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 90% and a venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 77.8 mmHg. He had a 0.2-cm mouth opening and hence laryngoscopy was not possible. His saturation was improved to 95% by oxygen with a facial mask. The same night he deteriorated to an SpO2 of 80%. Next, we tried blind nasal intubation with an ETT loaded with stylet, which failed. Then, we tried Size 1 laryngeal mask airway (Well Lead Medical, China) which failed as well. His respiratory distress was improved after we placed an NPA and saturation returned to 100%.\n\n【8】He was planned for correction of the mandible with mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) under general anaesthesia. After giving oxymetazoline nasal drops to dry his secretion, we slowed dialled sevoflurane to 6% and then back to 3% to maintain his spontaneous breathing. Fibreoptic scope (Olympus, Japan) revealed the epiglottis lying on the posterior pharynx, which could not be manoeuvred. Due to repeated attempts, the patient developed laryngospasm, and his (SpO2) was reduced to 70%. Anaesthetic depth was increased with sevoflurane and SpO2 improved to 94%. Once laryngospasm settled, a 2.8-mm outer diameter video ureteroscope was introduced through the nasal cavity. Glottis was visualized but the ETT could not be negotiated into the trachea. Following jaw thrust and slight pulling of the tongue with Magill’s Forceps, a 150-cm long and 0.035-inch diameter atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic polyurethane-coated (PC) guidewire was introduced through the working channel of the video ureteroscope into the trachea under the vision  and a 3.5-mm ID ETT was railroaded over it and a definitive airway was established. Once the airway was secured, the patient had an MDO procedure and no adverse events were encountered. He was sent back to neonatal ICU and successfully extubated there on post-operative day 5. Presently, the child is doing fine and only requires minimal oxygen support with nasal prongs.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Infants with PRS may exhibit stridor, chest retraction, sleep apnoea, cyanosis and respiratory insufficiency along with different degrees of upper airway blockage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, 25–45% of new-borns with PRS exhibit feeding and swallowing issues, which may be connected to respiratory conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. During laryngoscopy and intubation, the Pierre Robin Syndrome presents significant difficulty for anaesthesiologists, making oxygenation and ventilation challenging. The airway structure of PRS new-borns makes them one of the most challenging cases to intubate. The anaesthesiologist uses a variety of tools, including the Ambuscope, fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) and video laryngoscopes, in difficult airway management situations.\n\n【11】We describe the novel use of a video ureteroscope (Olympus URF-V2) as an airway endoscope. In urology, kidney stones are typically removed with a video ureteroscope. It has a wider field of vision and is longer than a FOB. Currently, sizes with an outside diameter of only 1.8 mm are accessible. In contrast to a FOB, which only offers an angulation of 160° up and 90°, it offers 275° of up- and downangulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. There is little research on video ureteroscopes for airway endoscopy, and there are few sporadic case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. With a distal tip diameter ranging from 5.3 to 8.7 Fr, flexible ureteroscopes are currently offered in a variety of sizes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We used a 2.8-mm (8.4 Fr) video ureteroscope with a working channel of 1.2 mm to pass the atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic PC guidewire into the trachea. These guidewires used through a working channel of the ureteroscope are coated with a hydrophilic polymer like polytetrafluoroethylene and have a distal atraumatic tip useful for negotiating difficult ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool in the armoury of an anaesthesiologist. At our institute, which is a tertiary care centre, we are now training and utilising video-ureteroscope as an airway endoscope. We have already made use of this vital instrument in several other cases like removal of foreign body, difficult airway management in severe temporomandibular joint ankylosis and also in some cases of one lung ventilation for checking the correct placement of Double lumen tube. Through this case report, we want to highlight the importance of this novel method of airway management which can go a long way in developing new strategies for difficult airway management in the times to come. The legal designate consent has been taken from the father of the child.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】We conclude that a flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool for difficult airway management.\n\n【14】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【15】A.B. was responsible for the conception and design of the work; R.G. did the analysis of review of literature; S.T. drafted the work and compared our analysis with previous literature on the case.

The development of tolerance and immunogical effects of these agents in people living with HIV are not well assessed as these persons are often excluded from clinical trials. Herein, we report a case of a Caucasian woman who received multiple sequential immunotherapies for severe ulcerative colitis. Due to steroid-refractory disease, receipt of maximal doses of mesalamine and initial repeated decline of surgical intervention, she went on to receive biologic immune inhibitors like tumor necrosis fator-α blockers infliximab and adalimumab, the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab, anti-interleukin 12/23 blocker ustekinumab and Janus Kinase inihibitor tofacitinib without achieving remission. Only minor infectious complications were encountered and no significant changes in CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio occurred. This case provides support for the safety and tolerability of the above immunotherapies in people living with HIV with suppressed viral load on antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), one provides immunosuppressive therapy with the hope of tempering excessive inflammation while preserving immune function. However, if the proper balance between immunosuppression and immune preservation is not achieved, an individual will be tipped into immunodeficiency with increased infection risk. People living with HIV (PLWH) are often excluding from clinical trials involving biologics based on concerns of additive immunosuppression and infection risk. Consequently, little data are available to guide clinicians in managing PLWH who suffer from advanced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, we present the case of young woman with HIV infection and extensive UC refractory to many therapies. Following repeated decline of surgical intervention, she was treated with multiple sequential immunomodulators and did not experience any major adverse effects.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old, Canadian-born Caucasian woman was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. She began antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil 300 mg/emtracitabine 200 mg orally once daily and raltegravir 400 mg orally twice daily in 2012, when her CD4 count rapidly dropped to 86 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Later that year, she began experiencing frequent episodes of bloody diarrhea, with up to 20 stools daily, with cramping, rectal bleeding and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Stool was repeatedly negative for _Clostridium difficile_ and ova and parasites. Colonoscopy demonstrated severe pancolitis and biopsies consistent with active UC with acute cryptitis, crypt abcesses with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal erosions, acute inflammatory exudate with architectural disortion. Hematoxylin and eosin stains for cytomegalovirus and histochemical exams for Herpes Simplex Virus I/II were negative. Despite high doses of oral prednisone (40–60 mg daily) and several emergency room visits to receive intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for flares, she was deemed steroid-refractory.\n\n【6】Later that year, she received maximum doses of oral mesalamine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as mesalamine suppositories and enemas. She then received infliximab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012–2013)</u>, an antitumor necrois fator-α (anti-TNFα) monoclonal antibody, until antibody formation. Despite maximum doses of adalimumab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u>, her UC remained refractory although no antibodies were detected using a drug-tolerant assay and medication levels were therapeutic (>12 μg/ml, the highest limit of detection). Attempts to taper her steroids resulted in flare-ups and a cushingoid feature. She declined colectomy as she felt this would interfere with her lifestyle, especially since she was getting married, and concerns about her future fertility.\n\n【7】One of the options explored was the use of vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against α4β7 integrin, via a clinical trial. However, due to the patient’s HIV infection she was not eligible to participate in any of the recruiting trials at the centre as HIV infection is frequently an exclusion criteria. Colonoscopy in 2015 revealed severe inflammation with ulcerations and friability consistent with Mayo 3 colitis, despite high-dose steroids and adalimumab, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 80 mg weekly. By December 2015, vedolizumab was obtained through standard of care and initiated at 300 mg IV at weeks 0 and 2, 6 (loading dose) and then every 8 weeks thereafter as a maintenance dose. She was still bleeding from the rectum and had decreased weight, therefore daily prednisone 10 mg orally was maintained. She achieved clinical remission by March 2016 and steroids were stopped. Two months later, she developed right foot cellulitis following a minor trauma during a pedicure and required 48 hours of IV followed by oral antibiotics.\n\n【8】Colonoscopy in June 2016, 3 months after stopping steroids, showed worsening condition with Mayo 3 colitis, so she was changed to vedolizumab 300 mg IV q 4 weeks and prednisone increased to 40 mg orally (po) daily. Anti-α4β7 antibodies were not detected. She was passing bright red blood per rectum 12 times in 24 hours and having five stools per 24 hours with lower abdominal cramping and rectal pain. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinab 10 mg po twice daily, was initiated October 2016 and prednisone 40 mg po daily maintained. Symptoms persisted requiring admission for IV prednisolone, but she continued to decline surgical colectomy. She also developed a bacterial vaginitis treated with metronidazole cream and later a skin furuncle, treated with oral antibiotics.\n\n【9】Following tofacitinib, she received interleukin 12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab March–September 2017. She gained 30 pounds in 1 year (body mass index 37), increased abdominal fat and bilateral cataracts due to cortisone. Attempts to decrease prednisone below 30 mg daily led to bloody diarrhea (12–17 bowel movements daily). She eventually accepted to undergo subtotal abdominal colectomy 通用删除1(英):<u>(pathology shown in Fig. 1 )</u> with rectal stump and temporary end ileostomy by June 2018. She improved and was seen for follow-up a month post-op, at which time she was having increasing right lower quadrant pain and rising CRP. A computed tomography scan demonstrated collections in the subcutaneous fat surrounding the ostomy and a second collection centimeter with rim enhancement and fat stranding. These were drained and cultures grew _E. coli_ and _B. fragilis_ . She responded to IV antibiotics for 3 days followed by oral step-down antibiotics to complete 2 weeks. Eight months following her colectomy, she developed polyarthralgia in her interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, knees and feet with a normal CRP and a negative Rheumatoid Factor while off prednisone, thought to be either inflammatory or mechanical polyarthralgia. Pathology on surveillance sigmoidoscopy March 2019 demonstrated chronic active proctitis with ulceration consistent with chronic idiopathic IBD. Throughout this entire time, her CD4 range was between 400 and 900 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.41:1.12, and HIV viral load remained suppressed since November 2012.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Colonic resection histology.

She also received a small-molecule JAK inhibitor. TNF-α inhibitors and α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blockers are used with extreme caution in PLWH due to concerns of additional immunosuppression and subsequent infection risk. However, during her 6 years of being on immunosuppressants, the patient only experienced one episode of cellulitis, bacterial vaginosis, a skin furuncle and peristomal abscesses, all of which were easily managed with traditional therapies. Another concern with the use of integrin receptor antagonists in PLWH, although rare, is the possibility of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy due to John Cunningham (JC) virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent blood plasma JC virus testing prior to vedolizumab initiation and this polymerase chain reaction testing was negative. She also denied any neurological signs or symptoms throughout treatment.\n\n【13】This woman’s case demonstrates that the spectrum of drug classes available and sequential use of biologics for treatment of UC were safe in this patient with well-controlled HIV infection ART, including an TNF-α blocker, JK inhibitor, IL-12/23 blocker and the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab. Our patient did not incur any significant changes in her CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio during the course of her treatments and infections were relatively minor. Although we did not use combination biologics in this patient, their efficacy and safety for IBD and other and other inflammatory diseases associated was explored in a systematic review of observational studies which did not find any differences related to improvements in disease condition, adverse effects or infection rates in patients receiving combined treatment compared to placebo groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A clinical trial (NCT02764762) examining efficacy and safety of combined vedolizumab, adalimumab and oral methotrexate in patients with Crohn’s Disease is in progress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Until evidence from clinical trials is available on efficacy and safety of biologics and combination therapy in PLWH, case reports and case series provide a channel for dissemination of these experiences within the medical community.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Pathologist, Dr Zu-hua Gao, for provision of the histology image.

In general, _N. cyriacigeorgica_ causes infections in immunocompromised individuals and has been reported in clinical samples worldwide. However, the isolation and speciation of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory are complicated and time consuming. Recent mass spectrometry techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) have been successfully integrated into many routine diagnostic microbiology laboratories, allowing for the rapid, accurate and simple identification and speciation of many different microorganisms, including difficult-to-identify bacterial species. Here, we present a case report of a 65-year-old female patient from the neurology ward of Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who was infected with _N. cyriacigeorgica_ . The bacterium was successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, with species identification subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In humans, _Nocardia_ spp. predominantly causes pulmonary nocardiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, _Nocardia_ species are also capable of disseminating from the primary site of infection, such as the lungs, to other organs, including the central nervous system. As such, _Nocardia_ are capable of generating disease at different body sites, including abscesses in the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although _Nocardia_ infections are primarily seen in patients with immunodeficiency, AIDS, cancer and diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, cases have been reported in individuals with fully functioning immune systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among the _Nocardia_ species, _Nocardia cyriacigeorgica_ ( _N. cyriacigeorgica_ ) is an emerging pathogen that appears to be adapting from environmental to human host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The bacterium is primarily found in soil, but can also live in stagnant water and enter the human body through dust respiration and traumatic inoculation. Unfortunately however, the microbiological isolation and identification of _Nocardia_ species from clinical samples within typical hospital laboratories is difficult and time consuming when using conventional diagnostic methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. One potential candidate method that allows for rapid and accurate identification of bacterial species is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). In this case report, we describe the use of MALDI-TOF for identifying the bacterial species _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , isolated from a brain abscess. Species confirmation was obtained via subsequent 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 65-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department of Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, complaining of headache, vomiting, dysarthria and right-sided weakness. She had end-stage renal disease, relied on hemodialysis, and suffered from ischemic heart disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenia and hypothyroidism. The patient subsequently underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which showed a left-sided parietal lesion measuring 5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5 cm, with a midline shift . The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital, and surgery was performed to aspirate material from the brain abscess. Gram staining and acid fast staining of the brain abscess aspirate did not show any bacteria, however, several white blood cells were observed. The aspirate was grown on enrichment medium (RCM) and also on solid media (nutrient agar) and after 72 hours, bacterial growth was found on both media. Conventional methods using biochemical testing and Gram-staining failed to identify the bacterium present within the bacterial colonies, therefore samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF (Bruker MALDI Biotyper System) analysis. MALDI-TOF identified the abscess bacterium as _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , with a score value of 2.11, indicating a ‘High Confidence Identification’ of the bacterial species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Species identification was subsequently confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial isolate by an external reference laboratory (Mayo Clinic, AZ, USA) _._ Antibiotic susceptibility testing—using disc diffusion and E-testing according to CLSI guidelines—showed that the isolated _N. cyriacigeorgica_ species was resistant to penicillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin (intermediate), but susceptible to cotrimoxazole, imipenem, fucidin and ceftriaxone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The patient received empirical antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, a follow-up MRI showed the remaining presence of the lesion, which was excised by craniotomy. An MRI taken following surgery showed no abscess. Postoperatively the patient was found to be well and discharged.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|MRI showing a left parietal lesion measuring 5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5 cm, with a midline shift.</u>\n\n【8】### DISCUSSION\n\n【9】_Nocardia_ species are Gram-positive, aerobic, branching and filamentous bacteria belonging to the actinomycetes group of bacteria, which are ubiquitously found in soil and water. However, infections due to _Nocardia_ are difficult and cumbersome to diagnose because they lack specific clinical signs and do not exhibit pathognomonic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In addition, the bacteria do not grow efficiently in culture media, leading to slow or sometimes no growth, which may specifically be because of the presence of other commensals. Because of these issues, the identification of _Nocardia_ at the species level in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory is very time consuming, and accurate species identification is often not possible using conventional techniques. Currently, the species identification of _Nocardia_ is based on gene sequencing, specifically sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, which has become the ‘gold standard’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The use of genetic-based species identification methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing plays a vital role in _Nocardia_ species determination. Accordingly, these techniques aid epidemiological investigations and provide a better understanding of the management and treatment of nocardiosis infections because different _Nocardia_ species may exhibit different antimicrobial susceptibility patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, genetic-based methods of identification are time consuming and not always available in smaller diagnostic microbiology laboratories; thus, accurate and rapid identification techniques such as MALDI-TOF are showing their value in the current diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory. For example, in this case report, initial pathogen identification was achieved using MALDI-TOF, which has the potential to rapidly and accurately identify _Nocardia_ species in clinical samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, given the rarity of nocardial brain abscesses, the confirmation of the genus/species identification using methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing is still recommended.\n\n【10】The prolonged use of corticosteroids, organ transplantation, the presence of cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection are considered to be the most common predisposing factors for nocardial infections (nocardiosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When nocardial infection occurs, species such as _N_ . _farcinica_ , _N_ . _paucivorans_ , _N. asteroids_ , _N. arthritidis_ and _N. cerradoensis_ have been reported. Among the _Nocardia_ group, _N. cyriacigeorgica_ is one of the most often implicated species in human nocardiosis, including septicemia, endophthalmitis, after liver transplantation, as secondary infections in patients with cancer, in pulmonary infections, cellulitis, spinal abscess, empyema and brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In conclusion, brain abscesses associated with _Nocardia_ species are rare and this is the first case report of the identification of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ isolated from a cerebral abscess in Saudi Arabia. The success of MALDI-TOF in the identification and speciation of difficult to identify bacterial isolates such as _N. cyriacigeorgica_ will help clinicians make effective clinical decisions, particularly in the treatment of life-threatening critical infections such as brain abscesses.\n\n【12】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【13】None required.\n\n【14】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【15】None required as patient deceased.\n\n【16】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【17】Mohammad AlMogbel.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.

However, cytotoxic chemotherapy might help control CD during the treatment period. Here, we report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer. A 39-year-old woman with CD controlled by infliximab and mesalazine was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Infliximab treatment was discontinued temporarily so that the patient could receive NAC. However, her CD symptoms intensified during chemotherapy, and after her symptoms improved after a one-time administration of infliximab, the remainder of NAC was completed with a corticosteroid. Bilateral breast conservation surgery was performed. Histopathological examination revealed partial response of the left breast cancer and no residual cancer in the right breast. Breast irradiation and hormone therapy were added and no signs of recurrence have been observed for 5 years. CD has been well controlled with adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. When a patient with CD is diagnosed with breast cancer, the management of both CD and breast cancer can be challenging. Generally, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (infliximab, adalimumab) for CD should be stopped during chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, because the use of anti-TNF agents, especially during treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, may cause severe immunosuppression. Previous reports suggested that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission during cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer after interruption of infliximab.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 39-year-old pre-menopausal woman had CD, which has been well controlled by 5-mg/kg intravenous infliximab every 8 weeks and 2000 mg per day oral mesalazine for the last 7 years. She was referred to our hospital due to complaints of a palpable mass in the left breast. She had no family history.\n\n【6】Breast examination revealed a 3.5-cm lump in the left breast without swollen axillary lymph nodes. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 50-mm mass in the left breast and an 18-mm lesion in the right breast . Core needle biopsy (CNB) of the left breast tumor revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 5%. CNB of the right breast tumor revealed ductal carcinoma in situ that was ER-positive, PgR-positive and HER2-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 7%. Computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy showed no findings of distant metastasis. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. BRCA genetic test was not performed because she had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. PI3K test and NGS were not performed because these were not covered by national health insurance in Japan.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MRI findings; (A) initial breast MRI of the bilateral breast tumor; (B) tumor in the left breast after 4 cycles of taxane; (C) tumor in the left breast after the completion of NAC.</u>\n\n【8】NAC consisting of taxane and anthracycline was scheduled to enable breast-conservation surgery, after temporary discontinuation of infliximab. She received NAC with 4 cycles of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks and was treated with mesalazine for CD. The left breast tumor decreased to 30 mm . However, at that time, she complained of slight-to-moderate abdominal distension and diarrhea 4–5 times per day and severe fatigue for 1 week. There were no other symptoms including fever or weight loss. Abdominal CT revealed mild ileus caused by small intestine stenosis , and her C-reactive protein level was 0.17 mg/dl, while her baseline was 0.01 mg/dl. The CD activity index was moderately active, which indicates exacerbated CD. NAC was temporarily interrupted, and 250-mg infliximab was administered once. CD remission was induced in 1 week. Eight weeks later, NAC consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks was resumed with 40-mg predonine for CD. After the completion of NAC, the left breast tumor decreased to 8 mm . The patient underwent bilateral partial mastectomy and left sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection. Histopathological examination of surgical specimens showed a 40-mm IDC in the left breast and no residual cancer in the right breast.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|CT findings; abdominal CT showed mild ileus.</u>\n\n【10】After surgery, she received adjuvant radiation therapy to both breasts and has remained on tamoxifen and leuprorelin. She has survived without any signs of breast cancer recurrence for 5 years. Her CD has also been well controlled by adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】This is a case report of CD relapse during NAC for breast cancer after interruption of infliximab. A breast cancer diagnosis in a patient with CD increases the difficulty in managing the treatment of both CD and breast cancer. The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization guideline suggested that anti-TNF agents should be stopped during chemotherapy because of their ability to aggravate the bone marrow suppression induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Previous studies reported that the risk of CD relapse after anti-TNF agent withdrawal ranged from 30 to 40% at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and that patients in long-standing stable remission probably had a lower risk of relapse after anti-TNF cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Axelrad _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission by causing cell death or preventing cell division in rapidly dividing cells such as T lymphocytes and malignant cells. Koc _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> also reported that of 41 patients, none showed exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease during chemotherapy. We chose NAC because chemotherapy is recommended over endocrine therapy for pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease who warrant neoadjuvant therapy by clinical evidence and guideline. We discontinued infliximab because this patient had maintained a long-term remission of CD and because the cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer could also effectively control CD through its immunosuppressant effect. However, CD symptoms intensified after discontinuation of infliximab even though the patient was receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. We supposed that infliximab was very effective in controlling CD in this patient. Although we should have ruled out the presence of other disease including cytomegalovirus and _Clostridium difficile_ infections, re-administration of infliximab was effective because these symptoms were due to CD relapse. Fecal calprotectin test was not performed because it was not covered by national health insurance in Japan. In cases where CD symptoms flare during chemotherapy, it is not clear whether corticosteroids or anti-TNF should be given 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although CD symptoms remitted after one-time administration of infliximab, a corticosteroid was used during continuation of NAC because combination of chemotherapy and infliximab might cause severe immunosuppression. Interleukin inhibitors were not approved for CD in Japan and might also cause severe immunosuppression in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n【13】This case report highlights the important suggestion that CD may relapse after interruption of infliximab treatment even during treatment with NAC for breast cancer. It is necessary to assess the appropriate management of breast cancer in patients with CD, as well as CD in patients with breast cancer.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Ms Akiko Yuzuriha for her excellent technical assistance.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent for the publication of the case details was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>H.J. is the guarantor of this report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of infective endocarditis in a young patient who presented with an acute abdomen 2 months after being diagnosed with cerebrovascular accident. An abdominal computed tomography revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, and infarct in the right kidney and spleen as a result of systemic septic embolism.

Herein, we present a case of _Streptococcus gordonii_ infective endocarditis complicated by systemic embolization to multiple sites.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 28-year-old Bangladeshi man with no prior medical history initially presented with right-sided body weakness, and a brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed left middle cerebral artery infarct. Due to financial constraints, he was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 150 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. Two months later, he presented to our hospital with 3 days of generalized, colicky abdominal pain and 1 week of fever. He had no diarrhea, vomiting, recent abdominal trauma or surgical history.\n\n【8】His initial vital parameters revealed a blood pressure of 119/50 mm Hg and a temperature of 38.2°C. He was also tachycardic but saturating well in ambient air. On general examination, there was a collapsing pulse and finger clubbing, but no other signs of infective endocarditis. An oral examination revealed dental plaques but no caries. A thorough cardiovascular examination revealed the presence of an early diastolic murmur over the Erb’s point and a pansystolic murmur over the apical region radiating to the left axillary area. There were no signs of heart failure. A neurological examination revealed residual weakness in the right upper and lower limbs, with power of 4/5 compared to the left side. An abdominal examination revealed generalized tenderness throughout the abdomen, with the umbilical region being the most tender.\n\n【9】The initial full blood count revealed a white cell count of 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin of 8 g/dl, and normal platelet counts. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The chest and abdominal radiographs were normal. The patient was referred to the surgical team for an acute abdomen with a provisional diagnosis of perforated appendix. As a result, an urgent abdominal CT was performed, which revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis as well as right renal and splenic hypodense lesions, indicating infarction from septic emboli . There were no signs of a perforated appendix.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography of the abdomen showing (a) thrombosis at the distal part of the superior mesenteric artery, (b) a wedge-shaped hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen, (c) a hypodense lesion in the midpole of the right kidney.</u>\n\n【11】An urgent echocardiography was scheduled due to the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. The ejection fraction was normal, with severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation and a bicuspid aortic valve as an incidental finding. Vegetations were discovered at the tips of the anterior and posterior aortic valves, measuring 1.1 cm × 0.6 cm and 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm, respectively. Another vegetation was discovered at the body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring 0.5 cm × 0.8 cm .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Echocardiography showing vegetations at the aortic and mitral valves (anterior aortic valve = yellow arrow; posterior aortic valve = blue arrow; anterior mitral valve leaflet = green arrow).</u>\n\n【13】He was diagnosed with infective endocarditis, which was complicated by septic embolization to multiple sites, including the brain, mesentery, kidney and spleen. Three sets of blood cultures were taken from three different sites at different times, and he was started on empirical antimicrobial treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. His condition improved after antibiotics, as his fever and abdominal pain subsided.\n\n【14】After two days of incubation, _S. gordonii_ was isolated from all blood cultures using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry method . The isolate was susceptible to penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.016 microgram/ml. He received benzylpenicillin 3 MU intravenously every 4 hours for a total of 6 weeks. He was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for surgical intervention due to the high risk of further septic embolization from multiple vegetations, the large size of vegetation (>1 cm), and previous systemic embolism. The patient was planned for surgical excision of the vegetations and valve reconstruction. He, however, decided to return to his home country for further treatment and valve surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Gram stain of the blood culture showing gram-positive cocci grouped in chains.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】VGS are catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci arranged in chains on microscopic examination. The VGS can be classified into six major groups, namely _Streptococcus anginosus_ group, _S. mitis_ group, _S. sanguinis_ group, _S. bovis_ group, _Streptococcus salivarius_ group, and _S. mutans_ group. The _S. sanguinis_ group is further divided into _S. sanguinis_ , _Streptococcus parasanguinis_ , and _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】_S. gordonii_ colonizes oral biofilms on tooth surfaces and is involved in the formation of dental plaques. Bacteria can be released from oral biofilms and enter the bloodstream via tooth brushing, tooth extraction or oral trauma, resulting in systemic infection. _S. gordonii_ bacteremia can cause platelet aggregation and hyperinflammatory state, which contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had no recent dental procedures. Nonetheless, dental plaques were discovered during a physical examination, which could be the source of _S. gordonii_ .\n\n【19】_S. gordonii_ is a rare causative agent of infective endocarditis. Mosailova _et al._ reported a 31-year-old man with mitral valve infective endocarditis caused by _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Besides that, Komorovsky _et al._ reported a case of _S. gordonii_ \\-related infective endocarditis in an 11-year-old girl with Barlow’s mitral valve disease in which _S. gordonii_ was cultured from the resected vegetation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Systemic embolism is a devastating and potentially fatal complication of infective endocarditis that occurs in up to 50% of cases. In patients with infective endocarditis, this is usually caused by fragmentation of vegetation or cardiac tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Millaire _et al._ reported that nearly half of patients with infective endocarditis developed systemic embolic complications, with the central nervous system being the most common, followed by the spleen, kidney, lung, liver, bone and joint, iliac artery, and mesenteric artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Infective endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-susceptible VGS, including _S. gordonii_ , can be treated with parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone. Gentamicin should be added for the first 2 weeks of penicillin treatment in patients with relatively penicillin-resistant VGS infective endocarditis.

Lentiform nuclei are involved most commonly, but involvement of thalamus, midbrain and pons results in certain characteristic radiological signs on neuroimaging. Atrophy of cerebral and cerebellar cortex is also common yet under-recognized. Identification of these signs helps in the diagnosis in appropriate clinical setting.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Wilson's disease is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by inability to excrete copper into the bile, with excessive deposition of copper into the eyes, liver and brain. Within the central nervous system, basal ganglia are common sites of affection, but there are characteristic signs on neuroimaging identified due to involvement of brainstem. Of these signs, ‘face of giant panda’ and ‘trident’ signs are remarkably seen and point towards the diagnosis in appropriate clinical setting, especially when occur simultaneously.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 42-year-old gentleman presented with history of tremors of both upper limbs (left > right) since 1 year, postural instability since 8 months and slurring of speech since 3 months. Neurological examination showed Kayser–Fleischer (KF) rings in both eyes, rest and postural tremors of both upper limbs (proximal and distal), ataxic dysarthria, rigidity in all four limbs and gait ataxia. There was no evidence of jaundice or cirrhosis to suggest hepatic involvement.\n\n【6】Slit-lamp examination revealed KF rings in both eyes and 24 h urinary copper was diagnostic of Wilson's disease. Liver function tests were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed:\n\n【7】*   Diffuse hyperintensities in pons with ‘trident sign’ .\n\n【8】*   Symmetrical hyperintensities in both halves of midbrain and periaqueductal gray matter with hypointense red nuclei and subtantia nigra forming ‘face of giant panda’ sign  and hyperintensities in bilateral thalami.\n\n【9】*   Abnormal hypointensities seen in bilateral globus pallidus.\n\n【10】*   Hyperintesities in the claustrum and external capsule bilaterally.\n\n【11】*   Cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|MRI brain T2-weighted image shows abnormal hyperintensity in pons with characteristic hypointense ‘trident’ sign ( **A** ) and characteristic ‘face of giant panda’ sign in midbrain ( **B** ).</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder in which defective biliary excretion of copper leads to its accumulation, particularly in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease is due to mutations of the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) residing in the _trans_ \\-Golgi network of hepatocytes. Copper is collected in the liver, and after hepatic binding sites are saturated, it is released. Systemic disease then develops and there is an abnormal accumulation of copper in the brain. Neuroimaging findings in Wilson's disease vary from normal to symmetric bilateral areas of T2 hyperintensity involving subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, external capsules, thalami, midbrain and pons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. On T1W images, these lesions are normal to hypointense but hyperintense lesions especially in globus pallidus may also be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hypointensity on T2-weighted images may be seen sometimes, secondary to copper deposition or iron deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Yousaf _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported a case of Wilson's disease with minimal involvement of the lentiform nuclei and marked lesions involving the thalami, midbrain and pons.\n\n【15】The midbrain ‘face of giant panda sign’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> is due to high signal in the tegmentum, normal signals in the red nuclei and lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, and hypointensity of the superior colliculus. The ‘face of the miniature panda’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, or the ‘panda cub’ sign seen in dorsal pons, is delineated by the relative hypointensity of the medial longitudinal fasciculi and central tegmental tracts (‘eyes of the panda’) in contrast to the hyperintensity of the aqueduct opening into the fourth ventricle (‘nose and mouth of the panda’) bounded inferiorly by the superior medullary velum. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)-like changes have been described with three distinct patterns: (i) characteristic round shape, (ii) bisected and (iii) trisected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The trisected pattern with CPM-like changes is also known as ‘trident’ or ‘Mercedes-Benz’ sign.\n\n【16】T2-weighted confluent hyperintensities in the cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes are also uncommonly seen in Wilson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The high signal intensity on T2-weighted images is believed to be due to oedema, gliosis, necrosis and cystic degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In contrast to gray matter lesions, which are mostly symmetrical, those in the white matter are usually asymmetrical. Cerebral atrophy with ventricular dilatation, especially of the frontal horns and cerebellar atrophy, are also frequently observed in Wilson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In our patient, the brain MRI shows the tegmental hyperintensity and ‘face of giant panda’ sign in midbrain, CPM-like changes with ‘trident’ sign in pons, bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities, abnormal hypointensities in bilateral globus pallidus, cerebral cortical and cerebellar atrophy. As mentioned, these neuroimaging signs have been reported previously in literature, but simultaneous occurrence of the ‘giant panda’ sign in midbrain and ‘trident’ sign in pons is a rare occurrence. Both these signs, which are characteristics of Wilson's disease, when occur simultaneously, significantly increase the likelihood of this diagnosis if the clinical setting is appropriate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, collision neoplasms can appear in several structures, including the bladder, prostate, ovaries, lung, colon, stomach, skin and adrenal gland. it is extremely uncommon in the kidney. It has been described before, yet, they were mainly composed of oncocytoma and ChRCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. They are described in a few familial conditions, mainly renal oncocytosis, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and sporadic neoplasia.\n\n【24】On rare occasions, PRCC has been reported in renal collision tumors, and there are only nine cases in English literature of collision renal malignancies which mainly associated oncocytoma with PRCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Anani _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> reported a case of a renal collision tumor made of ChRCC and PRCC. While Zhang and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> report the first renal collision tumor comprising a PRCC and ChRCC with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation in a 63-year-old woman.\n\n【25】Radiological diagnosis is a challenge because the scanner is usually not able to make the difference betwixt oncocytomas, ChRCC and other renal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】It is accepted that ChRCC can coexist with oncocytoma because of their common origin, with ChRCC representing the malignant component and oncocytoma representing the benign one. PRCC and ChRCC have distinct cellular origins, and in this case, two different neoplasms were diagnosed.\n\n【27】Based on histopathological and immunological findings , the renal neoplasms were diagnosed as a collision tumor involving PRCC, ChRCC and sarcomatoid features; to our knowledge, we report the second case so far.\n\n【28】PRCC represents 10–15% of all renal malignancies. It is divided into two types, established on immunohistological and cytological data. Type 2 PRCC reveals a higher nuclear grade with higher stage than Type 1 neoplasms and is associated with a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To confirm the diagnosis of PRCC, immunohistochemistry could be helpful, which shows positive tumor cells for CD10, CK7 and vimentin. Thus, negative labeling of tumor cells by CK20, CD 117 and E-cadherin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In 1985, Thoenes and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> were the first to report 12 cases of renal chromophobe cell malignancies. It represents 5–10% of renal tumors. Different subtypes were described based on the percentage of cells, including classic, eosinophilic and mixed. Immunohistochemical studies show positivity for CK7, ksp-cadherin and CD82 and negativity for vimentin, CD10 and CA9 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>. Although sarcomatoid transformation has been barely reported with any type of RCC, it is generally described in association with ChRCC. The prognosis of ChRCC alone is good. However, with the sarcomatoid transformation, it tends to behave aggressively with a higher risk of metastasis. Which means that the sarcomatoid dedifferentiation represents an independent predictor of aggressive ChRCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】There is no standard treatment for renal collision neoplasms, with no data available concerning the therapy and prognosis of renal collision tumors on large series and long-term follow-up. Only complete surgical removal may be the curative treatment in non-metastatic tumors, or with multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Sinutinib or sorafenib) in metastatic lesions. Zhang and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> recommended sorafenib for a non-metastatic collision of PRCC and ChRCC with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, considering the aggressive behavior of the sarcomatoid transformation. As the activity of sunitinib and sorafenib is well known in metastatic renal clear cell tumors, Choueiri and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> evaluated the tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-clear cell carcinomas, including 53 patients with 41 metastatic PRCC and 12 metastatic ChRCC, confirming that patients with PRCC and ChRCC may have prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), with a higher PFS for metastatic PRCC treated with sunitinib rather than sorafenib. While only 25% of treated metastatic ChRCC achieved a response, two-thirds were treated with sorafenib and one-third were treated with sunitinib.\n\n【31】Our patient underwent a right nephrectomy followed by sunitinib. Routine follow-up showed no local recurrence with the stability of pulmonary metastasis at the first year. Until additional clinical trials are available, it seems to be appropriate to consider treating ChRCC with sarcomatoid features using multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors hereby declare that no conflict of interest exists and there are no financial or personal relationships or affiliations that could influence (or bias) the author's decisions, work or manuscript.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding or sponsor for this case report.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval from institutional ethical committee has been obtained before submitting this article.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent from the patient has been taken for this case report.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ibrahim Boukhannous as the corresponding author agrees to be the guarantor for the accuracy of final manuscript and submission of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although both demonstrate features of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads on the electrocardiogram (ECG), one must be distinguished from the other as their treatment options are different. We report a male patient who presented with recurrent syncope with a Brugada and a S1Q3T3 pattern on the ECG. Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) complicated by BrS was suspected. Twenty-four hours Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of an APE. He was treated with low molecular weight heparin and a repeat ECG taken the next day showed resolution of the Brugada and S1Q3T3 patterns. This case report illustrates that APE and BrS can present with similar clinical and electrocardiographic features of recurrent syncope and Brugada pattern, respectively.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The term Brugada phenocopy (BrP) has been coined to describe a group of heterogeneous conditions that induce Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns under the following circumstances of metabolism conditions, mechanical compression, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial and pericardial disease, ECG modulations and miscellaneous conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>. These conditions must be distinguished from true Brugada syndrome (BrS) as these are potential reversible causes. This case report illustrates that a patient can present with recurrent syncope associated with Brugada (ST-segment elevation in V1–V3) and S1Q3T3 patterns on the ECG. Co-existing BrS and acute pulmonary embolism (APE) were suspected. However, following prompt treatment of his PE, the patient recovered and the ECG Brugada and S1Q3T3 patterns disappeared.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension and varicose veins in lower limbs was admitted to the Department of Cardiology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University due to episodes of recurrent syncope. He reported four episodes of syncope per day but denied chest pain, dyspnea, cough or hemoptysis. On arrival, his blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg and had a temperature of 36.7°C, Cardiac auscultation revealed a normal S1, loud and split S2 in the absence of murmurs. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, a S1Q3T3 pattern, ‘coved’ ST-segment elevation (STE) with T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads V1–V3 . These findings were consistent of a Brugada pattern . Blood tests revealed raised levels of troponin (0.094 ng/ml, normal range: 0–0.02 ng/ml), brain natriuretic peptide (2286.0 pg/ml, normal range: 0–100 pg/ml) and D-dimer (10.0 mg/l, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/l). Blood gas revealed pO <sub>2 </sub> of 64 mmHg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 28.7 mmHg and pH of 7.47. Echocardiography revealed thickened left ventricular septum to 11.9 mm, enlarged right heart (anteroposterior diameter and supra-inferior diameter of right atrium: 49.3 and 54.6 mm; right ventricular diastolic diameter: 29.8 mm) that were accompanied by mild tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery diameter of 27.3 mm. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest by tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient was estimated to be 51 mmHg ( Supplementary Video 1 ). The mitral _E_ / _A_ ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction took values of as 0.6 and 56%, respectively. Twenty-four hours Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. APE was highly suspected and this was confirmed by computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram . Oxygen and low molecular weight heparin were promptly initiated. ECG performed the next day showed ongoing ST elevation in leads V1 and V2 but resolution of the coved ST segment and T-wave inversion, and therefore disappearance of the Type 1 pattern .

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report regarding BrP in a case with APE with recurrent syncope. In BrS, ST segment changes can be intermittent. Therefore, it was possible, although less likely, that the patient suffered from a PE that precipitated a Type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG. Moreover, BrP needs to be distinguished from BrS to avoid missed or incorrect diagnosis, which often leads to unnecessary medical tests and treatment.\n\n【10】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【11】Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.\n\n【12】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【13】None declared.\n\n【14】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【15】G.T. is supported by the Croucher Foundation.

A detailed exposure history revealed the patient had eaten mushrooms 48 hours ago during dinner at a Chinese cuisine buffet. He admitted to ingesting great quantities of a medley of cooked and raw mushroom including the Shiitake mushroom variety.\n\n【11】Physical examination was striking with a truncal dominant but generalized rash in a centripetal distribution . The lesions consisted of raised, relatively uniform erythematous papulovesicles arranged in linear arrangement.

The rash resolved within 1 week. It has been reported that shiitake dermatitis can also resolve spontaneously.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Shiitake dermatitis is a unique condition that is primarily characterized by the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions that it leaves on the extremities and trunks of patients. The first report of this dermatitis was in 1977 in Japan. Nakamura had observed that the ingestion of uncooked or under cooked shiitake mushrooms ( _Lentinula edodes_ ) was causing these peculiar skin eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> **.** There have since been many more cases reported not only in Asia, but in Europe and the Western Hemisphere as well. It is expected that as the popularity of shiitake mushrooms continues to grow there will be more cases of shiitake dermatitis reported.\n\n【17】There is little known about underlaying pathophysiology. In many cases reported there is often a delay of 24–72 hours between the consumption of the mushrooms and when the eruptions become noticeable, but the possibility of seeing eruptions sooner than that has been reported. In one case reported eruptions started only 5 hours after consuming raw shiitake mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> **.** Lentinan, a polysaccharide that is found in shiitake mushrooms is believed to play a role in causing the eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> **.** Whether it is a toxic reaction or a late hypersensitivity reaction, once ingested the polysaccharide will elicit the secretion of interleukin-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> **.** This cytokine promotes an inflammatory response in the body that results in the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions. Heat favors this theory because when fully cooked shiitake mushrooms are consumed no dermatitis is visible. The heat that is used when cooking the mushrooms denatures the lentinan making it nonfunctional.\n\n【18】Bleomycin a drug used in many cancer therapies also could induce flagellate dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically it may appear that bleomycin and shiitake mushrooms cause the same cutaneous effects, but a major distinguishing characteristic that is seen in bleomycin induced flagellate dermatitis is the visible hyperpigmentation that occurs at the site of the eruptions.\n\n【19】Typically, treatment options for shiitake dermatitis also known as flagellate dermatitis are similar; clinicians can prescribe oral antihistamines and/or topical corticosteroids to help reduce the inflammatory response. As to the duration of the cutaneous eruptions when the dermatitis is caused by the consumption of shiitake mushrooms, most eruptions will clear up within days. Simple avoidance is also important in the prevention of further eruptions. With regards to bleomycin in most cases patients must change their cancer therapy regimen or wait until their regimen is completed before the eruptions begin to resolve. Even after completion it can take several weeks to months for the eruptions to clear up.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hubert Huho Chavez, with HubLab LLC for researching trends in Mushroom consumption in the world and specifically in the United States and reviewing and editing the manuscript and photos.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Signed by patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe an unusual case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow tract obstruction in a patient with renal carcinoma.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department complaining chest discomfort and dyspnea. His cardiovascular history was unremarkable except for smoking and emphysema. Seven weeks earlier, because of persistent fever, cough and evidence of anemia, he had undergone chest–abdomen computed tomography (CT), with evidence of a solid mass (7 × 6.5 cm) in the left kidney. Brain CT scan, bone scintigraphy, colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy had shown no significant findings. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had been submitted to left radical nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. An echocardiogram performed at the time of the intervention had shown no significant abnormalities. The patient had been discharged 6 days after surgery, with the recommendation of continuing enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, lansoprazole, folic acid and antalgic treatment with oxycodone/naloxone and paracetamol/codeine.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was in poor general conditions, his pulse rate was 135 beats/min, and blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood examinations showed leucocytosis (23.29×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: 4.40–10.10×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), anemia (Hb 8.8 g/dL, normal range: 13.2–17.0 g/dL), thrombocytosis (734×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: <150–400×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), and increased C-reactive protein (46.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia–hypocapnia. Ultrasound examination showed no evidence of venous thrombosis. Echocardiography showed a large mass (56 × 33 mm) attached to the anterior wall of the RV outflow tract, characterized by irregular shape, inhomogeneous echogenicity, and no evidence of vascularization . Doppler examination of RV outflow tract showed a peak subpulmonary gradient of 21 mmHg at rest. During forced expiration, the peak gradient increased up to 35 mmHg , suggesting dynamic RV outflow obstruction. There were also right atrial and ventricular enlargement with preserved systolic function (TAPSE 24 mm, tricuspid s’ 19 cm/s), severe tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension (52 mmHg), and reduced inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava. CT pulmonary angiography  confirmed the presence of a large mass obstructing the RV outflow tract, with irregular shape and no evidence of vascularization, suggesting RV thrombus. There were no emboli in the pulmonary vessels, but multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases were observed. No thrombosis was found in the systemic veins. Because of the recent history of surgery and the oncological prognosis, thrombolysis or surgery were not indicated. The patient was hospitalized and therapy with full-dose enoxaparin, fluids, antibiotics and steroids was started. Ten days after admission, an echocardiogram showed no significant changes, except for a mild improvement in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (moderate) and a slight reduction in mass dimensions (52 × 30 mm) and RV outflow tract gradient at rest (16 mmHg). The patient was discharged 1 week later on anticoagulation, but died 2 days thereafter.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Echocardiographic images showing the right ventricular mass  from the long-axis parasternal view ( **A** ), short-axis parasternal views ( **B** and **C** ), and parasternal right ventricular inflow view ( **D** ).

The detection of an isolated RV thrombus is a relatively rare event in patients with preserved RV systolic function, particularly when not associated with concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. Isolated RV thrombi have been reported in the setting of RV myocardial infarction and arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, Beçhet disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While neoplasms are associated with a thrombophilic state that increases the risk of cardiovascular events, isolated RV thrombi in cancer patients have been rarely described, in most cases resulting from extensive tumor-thrombus venous propagation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This report describes a case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to RV outflow tract obstruction following left radical nephrectomy in a patient with renal carcinoma. Several atypical aspects should be pointed out in this case. First, the clinical presentation with acute heart failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Second, the lack of thrombotic involvement of the systemic venous district, which in cancer patients commonly represents the pathway for thrombus propagation to the right ventricle. Third, the development of a large RV thrombus despite an apparently appropriate dose of enoxaparin, equal to that currently recommended by the 2014 ASCO guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Lastly, the evidence of a rapid thrombus formation despite preserved RV systolic function, which highlights the importance of thrombophilic states in the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On the other hand, although the echocardiographic and CT characteristics of the mass support its thrombotic nature, autopsy was not performed, so that no histological confirmation is available. Contrast echocardiography is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses, and could have provided additional information about the avascularity of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It is also worthy of note that, for patients with no evidence of a concomitant acute cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism), to date there are no specific guidelines for the management of intracardiac thrombi, and the relative efficacy of anticoagulation, thrombolysis or other approaches is still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Lastly, while the negativity of CT angiography makes the hypothesis of concomitant pulmonary embolism unlikely, this possibility cannot be completely excluded.\n\n【13】We believe that these issues could suggest clinical implications. The possibility of a RV outflow obstruction due to an isolated thrombus should be considered in patients with acute RV failure, even when there is no concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. This may be particularly important in patients with neoplasms or other conditions associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Bedside echocardiography plays a fundamental role for prompt assessment in this context. Lastly, the effectiveness of standard prophylactic doses of enoxaparin might be reduced in patients with prothrombotic states.\n\n【14】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【15】Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding for this article.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not needed for this type of article.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent to publish this case was obtained.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors are the guarantors of this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Non-surgical treatment options for oligometastatic CRC confined to the liver which represents an intermediate state in the metastatic cascade are fast expanding. Currently, several liver-directed local therapeutic options are available, such as hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy, radio-frequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), stereotactic body radiotherapy and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). Many factors such as patient’s fitness, liver function (LF), tumour size, location of the tumour in the liver and scheduling of systemic therapy need to be considered when selecting patients for surgery or local liver-directed therapy. This case report illustrates a successful local treatment with staged HDRBT for a large and unresectable, liver only oligometastatic disease from CRC. This patient underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy (FOLFOX 4) followed by primary tumour resection and first stage of HDRBT to liver for a residual 14 cm tumour after the chemotherapy. After completing a further 4 cycles of chemotherapy with the same regimen, the tumour remained stable at 8 cm. She underwent a second stage of HDRBT to the same lesion and a repeat PET-CT scan done 8 weeks after the second HDRBT showed complete metabolic response. To our knowledge, this is the largest CRC metastatic liver lesion that has been successfully treated with HDRB.\n\n【2】Case Report , Brachytherapy , Liver Metastasis , Oligometastasis , Colorectal cancer\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】It is estimated that 25-30% of patients with colorectal cancer develop liver metastasis, and around one third of them have oligometastatic liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. For these patients, complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. However, surgical resection is possible in less than 20% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, which sheds light on the importance of non-surgical treatment options. These options include radio-frequency ablation (RFA), trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We present a patient in which the strategy of pairing HDRBT sequentially with systemic chemotherapy resulted in the complete metabolic response of a large unresectable colorectal liver metastasis which is illustrated as a timeline .\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 59-year-old lady was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colorectal Adenocarcinoma with isolated Liver metastasis (T2N0M1). She was not a suitable candidate for surgery, and was referred for further oncological treatment.\n\n【7】Blood tests revealed significant liver impairment, with a Child’s Pugh Score of B8. Total Bilirubin (3.37 mg/dL), AST(130 U/L) and ALP (603 U/L) were elevated, while Albumin (34 g/L) was normal. As for her FBC, she had low Haemoglobin (10.5 g/dL), elevated White Cell Counts (12.3 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and normal platelet count (371 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【8】A CT scan revealed a likely primary tumour at the proximal colon, a liver mass measuring 17.8 x 11.3 x 14.4 cm , with elevated CEA at 4410 ng/mL. At the end of the entire course of treatment, CEA dropped to 5.06 ng/mL, suggesting that the liver metastasis originated from the sigmoid colon.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Timeline of Events.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was treated with a combination of liver HDRBT sandwiched between systemic chemotherapy.\n\n【11】She underwent 4 cycles of systemic FOLFOX 4 chemotherapy and a CT scan afterwards showed that the liver lesion shrunk to 14.2 x 9.7 cm. Chemotherapy was however complicated by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. She then consented to brachytherapy to control the liver lesion during this chemotherapy break, with the initial intention of shrinking the lesion as a bridge to surgical resection.\n\n【12】In January, the patient underwent her first Brachytherapy procedure. A dose of 15Gy was given to the periphery of the tumour  via four brachytherapy applicators using Iridium 192 afterloader. Catheters were inserted using the anterior and right lateral approach. The applicators were placed in a way to adequately cover the entire tumour, with the first catheter inserted centrally within the tumour and the rest spaced out to cover the periphery of the tumour.\n\n【13】6 weeks later, an MRI scan showed good response with a 9.0 x 5.7 x 7.7 cm residual lesion.\n\n【14】The patient underwent further 4 cycles of chemotherapy. After the 5th cycle, she had a colectomy with end to end anastomosis to remove the primary tumour. Despite the reduced size of the liver lesion, the hepatobiliary surgeon deemed the mass unresectable due to the involvement of major vessels.\n\n【15】After 7 cycles, total bilirubin was 0.70 mg/dL and CEA dropped to 81. PET-CT scan still showed a remaining 7 x 6 cm metabolic active lesion with standardised uptake value (SUV) of 8.2. However, we were unable to complete the 8th cycle due to chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia.\n\n【16】She then underwent a second round of brachytherapy. A higher ablative dose of 25Gy was prescribed to the periphery of the lesion, with 90% of the lesion receiving 37.5Gy.\n\n【17】PET-CT scan after 8 weeks showed complete metabolic response . There was an ametabolic tumour of 6.8 x 4.2 x 6.7 cm in size, SUV decreased from 8.1 to 4.8 units. Her total Bilirubin was 1.05 mg/dL, and CEA dropped to 5.06, but Albumin was noted to be at 28 g/L. On clinical examination, the patient was noted to have mild ascites.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT scan showing liver metastasis at diagnosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT scan demonstrating liver metastasis post 4 cycles of chemotherapy.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Stage 1 Brachytherapy Plan.

Excellent clinical and biochemical results were achieved with a sharp fall in CEA from 4410 ng/ml to 5.06 ng/ml. The tumour regressed considerably with complete metabolic response. HDRBT liver has shown to be an excellent treatment option in this patient by inducing complete response in a very large unresectable tumour.\n\n【27】The first stage of brachytherapy with 15Gy after the initial 4 cycles of chemotherapy was to cytoreduce the tumour as it was too large for a curative dose. Liver size is not a major selection criterion provided that not more than 1/3 of normal liver receives more than 5Gy. RFA in contrast is not suitable due to the large tumour size and proximity to large vessels and bile ducts. Evidence shows that the main intra-hepatic bile ducts can withstand high doses of brachytherapy without significant toxicity unlike thermal heating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Compared to SBRT, HDRBT has less issues with respiratory motion. A sharper dose fall off outside the target margin is another advantage of HDRBT in delivering tumoricidal doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HDRBT delivers a single large and precise dose to the tumour while sparring the surrounding normal liver tissues, increasing its therapeutic ratio. HDRBT is an ‘in-side out technique’ where extreme doses in multiplication of 2-3 times of the prescribed dose are delivered near the applicator, ideal for overcoming radioresistance due to tumour hypoxia. This is relevant as the large tumour predisposes it to tumour hypoxia in the core. Evidence on the use of HDRBT for liver tumours are growing in the literature and ESMO guidelines have recognized HDRBT liver as a local liver directed treatment option for CRC metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Generally HDRBT is a well-tolerated procedure. Fever within a few hours after the procedure is common. Minor complications like pain, nausea, vomiting, and asymptomatic pleural effusion 12 to 24 hours after treatment have been reported in about 10% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Rare major complications include liver abscess and subcapsular bleeding needing transfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In conclusion, this approach of sandwiching HDRBT with systemic chemotherapy for large liver tumours needs to be further studied. This 2 stage approach of initial lower dose cytoreduction of tumour followed by an ablative dose of brachytherapy has proven to be a successful strategy in controlling the large liver metastasis in this case, that has not been previously described.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the patient for her consent to allow us to publish her medical information and story in this manuscript.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest to be declared.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have obtained written consent from the patient.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.K.A.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Department and institution address where research was conducted: Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Advanced Medical & Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bertam 13200 Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang Malaysia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Blood cultures grew Abiotrophia Defectiva (AD) sensitive to vancomycin. Patient underwent emergent surgical closure of aorto RV fistula and aortic root replacement along with pulmonary and mitral valve replacement. Endocarditis caused by AD has been reported to result in heart failure, septic embolization and destruction of the valve despite use of appropriate antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the only case of AD endocarditis without any identified entrance route; requiring replacement of pulmonary, mitral and aortic valve due to extensive valvular damage and large vegetations.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Abiotrophia species, previously known as nutritionally deficient streptococcus (NDS) was first identified in 1961 by Frenkle and Hirsh in a case of sub-acute infective endocarditis (IE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. NDS was initially classified as Streptococcus Defectiva and Streptococcus Adjacens and later their names were changed to Abiotrophia Defectiva (AD) and Abiotrophia Adjacens. AD is gram-positive cocci, although coccobacilli and bacilli forms may occur, depending on the culture medium.\n\n【4】AD is a part of the normal flora of oral cavity, urogenital and intestinal tracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It has been associated with a variety of serious infections including bacteremia, septic arthritis, brain abscess and IE, pancreatic abscess, osteomyelitis and crystalline keratopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

We report a rare case of Aorto- Right ventricular (RV) fistula and multiple valve endocarditis caused by AD.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 41-year-old male originally from West Africa with a questionable history of ventriculoseptal defect (VSD), presented with worsening exertional dyspnea and palpitations, loss of appetite, lower extremity edema and a 30 pounds weight loss over 6 weeks. On admission, his temperature was 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure of 104/50 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination was significant for chronically ill cachexic male with a BMI of 21 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , jugular venous distension, bilateral rales, tachycardia, RV heave and 4/6 pan-systolic murmur with a palpable thrill throughout the precordium. Blood cultures were obtained for suspected endocarditis and empiric intravenous antibiotics were started. An initial transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a large mass attached to the aortic valve leaflet measuring 3.2 × 0.6 cm (Supplementary Videos 1–2), severe aortic regurgitation with holodiastolic flow reversal in the aorta , mass attached to the flail anterior mitral valve leaflet resulting in severe mitral regurgitation , mass attached to pulmonic valve, significant pulmonic regurgitation  and severe pulmonary hypertension with Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure of 65 mm Hg. Additionally, dilatation of the aortic root along with fistula between the aortic sinus and the RV outflow tract was seen . Within 24 h, blood culture revealed gram-positive cocci in two out of two bottles, subsequently identified as Abiotrophia species. Patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further management. He underwent right heart catheterization demonstrating elevated filling pressures, low cardiac index and shunt fraction of 2.1. Emergent surgery revealed an aortic root abscess. He underwent prophylactic grafting of the left anterior descending coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery as the left main coronary Os was close to the aortic annulus. Patient also underwent bio-prosthetic pulmonary and mitral valve replacement, closure of the congenital VSD and closure of aorto-RV fistula using bovine pericardial patches in addition to an aortic root replacement with porcine root prosthesis. Post-operatively, patient developed atrial fibrillation and was subsequently started on amiodarone therapy. He was on intravenous penicillin and gentamycin during his hospitalization. Transesophageal echocardiogram, post intervention, revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45% and competent bio-prosthetic valves. Repeat blood cultures remained negative and patient was discharged on intravenous vancomycin via peripherally inserted central catheter.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Holodiastolic flow reversal in aorta.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to pulmonic and aortic valves</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 8:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to mitral valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 9:|删除段之间换行|3D Transesophageal echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to the mitral valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 10:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing possible flail mitral valve and large vegetation attached to aortic valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 11:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 12:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 13:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 14:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 15:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 16:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】AD is a rare cause of endocarditis. However, few studies have estimated that AD is responsible for 5–6% of all cases of IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. AD is usually isolated from an immunocompetent host and is a very important cause of blood culture negative IE. It is often seen as a satellite lesion around other bacteria that secrete pyridoxal such as Staphylococcus. AD requires pyridoxine and Vitamin B6 for growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. AD is difficult to identify as it has unique nutritional requirements, is pleomorphic, and is a very slow growing organism. A rapid, yet simple and inexpensive method to identify AD is by using MALDI-TOF-MS (Matrix associated laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometer). AD endocarditis carries higher morbidity and mortality than endocarditis caused by any other streptococci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Multiple factors that add to the virulent nature of this organism are secretion of exopolysaccharide, ability to adhere to fibronectin and a special affinity for endovascular tissue. IE due to AD is also attributed to the preexistence of prior or congenital heart disease and has been reported to cause native and prosthetic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Despite of the use of appropriate antibiotics, AD endocarditis is known to cause serious complications leading to heart failure, septic embolization and destruction of the valves. The recommended antibiotic treatment for AD endocarditis consists of penicillin or ampicillin with gentamicin for 4–6 weeks, according to the American Heart Association guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. _In vitro_ antibiotic susceptibility does not reflect clinical outcome. Heart failure is the most serious complication of endocarditis that often requires valve replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Aggressive treatment becomes essential with development of complications, with ~50% of the patients eventually requiring surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our patient, due to a definite embolization potential of the large vegetation and extensive multivalvular damage, a pulmonary, mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery was performed. A multi-disciplinary team comprising of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, infectious disease specialists and intensive care specialists contributed to the favorable outcome.\n\n【27】In general, Aorto-RV fistulas have been described to occur because of rupture of congenital and acquired sinus of Valsalva aneurysms. Other reported causes that result in aorto-RV fistula include blunt or penetrating chest trauma, aortic dissection, high ventricular septal defect repair and aortic valve surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report of AD endocarditis requiring replacement of pulmonary, mitral and aortic valves. This case also stands unique, as it demonstrates an association between Aorto-RV fistula and AD Endocarditis. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of Abiotrophia endocarditis that involved the aortic, pulmonary and mitral valve without an identified entrance route.\n\n【28】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【29】Supplementary material is available at _Oxford Medical Case Reports_ online.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This organ replacement technique provides additional benefits beyond just resting the kidneys, evacuation of excess fluid, but also helps clear lactate and harmful inflammatory mediators. Moreover, coupled with the adsorption method using an innovative adsorbent coating agent on the filter, it is able to increase the clearance of unwanted interleukins, which were previously difficult to remove due to their intermediate molecular weight.\n\n【4】CASE SERIES\n-----------\n\n【5】Based on the frequencies and characteristics described in Table 1 , most of our admitted patients were male and were in the range of 18–65 years.\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Frequencies and characteristics\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n【9】Open in new tab\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Frequencies and characteristics\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n【13】Open in new tab\n\n【14】All of our observed 25 patients admitted to ICU in December–January 2021 were diagnosed of ARDS due to the Delta type of COVID-19. Of the 25 patients, 13 managed to survive on additional combination therapy between standard therapy with additional hemofiltration/adsorption using Oxiris™ and plasmapheresis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Combined therapy effect of standard care and hemofiltration technique in COVID ARDS survivors.</u>\n\n【16】The standard therapy that is carried out employs conservative fluid management and active fluid removal with negative balance cumulative, ventilator strategy with PEEP 5–12 targeting SpO2 92–95%, early feeding, antimicrobial stewardship without ECMO, prone positioning or intravenous immunoglobuline.\n\n【17】Of the 13 surviving patients, the average length of stay was 8.8 days, whereas the length of use of the ventilator was 5.2 days . This appears to be better than the 12 patients who did not survive, with the average day of death being the seventh and eighth days.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Since its inception in the 1970s, CKRT has come a long way beyond its original intended use. The so-called Extracorporeal Blood Purification has expanded the scope of CKRT that, initially, only focused on the kidney to become an extensive effort to purify blood from unwanted waste products and inflammatory mediators. This purification role becomes prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, where mechanical anti-inflammatory therapy is needed to improve the condition of immune system dysregulation but still maintain hemodynamic stability in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendation on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, it is recommended to administer low tidal volume (4–8 mL/kgBW) with a target oxygen saturation of 92–96%, high PEEP use to improve oxygenation, traditional recruitment lung maneuvers, prone position for 12–16 hours and continuous use of muscle relaxants may be considered to achieve the desired ventilation target. An extracorporeal therapy and nitric oxide inhalation is also recommended in supporting facilities. Excess fluid is also avoided to ensure the lungs remain dry so as not to exacerbate the inflammation that interferes with ventilation and oxygenation. However, the excessive inflammatory parameter still needs to be removed by purification systems such as CKRT and plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Unfortunately, its unavailability in many requiring hospitals and the equipment high cost makes this tool rarely accessible to those who need it. Plasmapheresis method is attempted as an intermediate option in this cost issue. Therefore, the starting point for dissemination of this external purification technique is not only based on CKRT but has incorporated plasmapheresis into it.\n\n【22】As seen in Fig. 2 , as many as seven patients received CKRT, whereas six patients received plasmapheresis. The adsorbent (Oxiris™) was used in seven patients taking CKRT, whereas the remaining six remained on plasmapheresis, and all of them continued to receive standard therapy. The other 12 patients did not get the same opportunity for CKRT and plasmapheresis due to financial problems and availability of filters.\n\n【23】Looking into the analysis of adsorbent types in Fig. 3 , we found that those survivors with Oxiris™ discharged earliest from the ICU, and the other two types such as M100 and plasmapheresis were discharged later. This simple analysis could emphasise more on the important role of early CKRT to remove cytokine in critical COVID-19 patients. Although based on the recent retrospective, a multicenter, descriptive study included 83 patients with CRS from three hospitals in Wuhan, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> CKRT significantly reduced the inflammation; however, it did not decrease the fatality rate of patients with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Therefore, the choice of CRRT indication, dialysis time and dialysis mode should be more careful and accurate in COVID-19 patients with CRS.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Kaplan–Meier survival analysis on the adsorbent type.</u>\n\n【25】Unfortunately, a small sample size, absence of specific cytokine examination and large bias of therapeutic variation, unclear baseline patient history are the weaknesses of our case series. Conclusions could not be drawn specifically from this series, but it could show the potential dual use of CKRT to manage a cytokine storm.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Yohanes W.H.

She was diagnosed with L5 discitis and suspected infective endocarditis complicating a _Staphylococcus aureus_ blood stream infection (BSI). Transoesophageal echo had shown a mobile echo density on the aortic valve and the diagnosis of discitis was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was no clear source of the bacteraemia. The patient reported a significant history of chills and fevers for 1 week post coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. There was no evidence of collection at the site of vaccination. The _S.aureus_ blood culture isolate was susceptible to flucloxacillin. She was commenced on 2 g of flucloxacillin 4 hourly along with 1 g of IV paracetamol four times daily for analgesia. This regimen continued for 2 weeks with an appropriate response clinically and biochemically. The only side-effect of treatment noted was persistent nausea, developing around Day 10.\n\n【6】The patient’s condition began to deteriorate on Day 16, with increasing nausea and several episodes of vomiting. She became hypotensive, dyspnoeic and developed a reduction in her urine output. The biochemistry results demonstrated a new acute kidney injury (AKI) with creatinine rising from 78 to 160 μmol/L. Blood gas showed a pH of 7.29, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.3 kPa and a bicarbonate of 15 mmol/L. Lactate was normal. These results were consistent with a high anion gap acidosis (HAGMA) of 26 mEq/L. Alternative causes of acute deterioration with these symptoms and biochemistry, such as sepsis, were considered and excluded. PGA was suspected due to the treatment regimen alongside the biochemical indices. The nausea and vomiting were a response to low pH and the dyspnoea was an attempt to eliminate CO <sub>2 </sub> as compensation for the acidosis.\n\n【7】Diagnosis of PGA was confirmed with urine showing the presence of inorganic acids. Paracetamol was stopped and flucloxacillin was changed to a cephalosporin (Cefurxime). The patient’s symptoms resolved and blood gas parameters normalized after 48 hours. However, she developed significant adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression and an allergic reaction to second- and third-line antimicrobial agents. These also had inadequate or suboptimal anti-staphylococcal cover and her inflammatory markers began to rise. Noscomial infection was ruled out at this stage with appropriate screening tests. A repeat MRI at 6 weeks demonstrated ongoing active infection at the L5 region. A reintroduction of flucloxacillin without paracetamol was successful and the patient completed another 6 week course with no further complications. Repeat MRI showed significant improvements in discitis.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】The risk of PGA secondary to the interaction between flucloxacillin and paracetamol is poorly recognized in clinical practice and literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The causes of a HAGMA can be summarized by the acronym GOLD-MARK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> (glycols, oxoproline, lactate, D-lactate, methanol, aspirin, renal failure and ketoacidosis).\n\n【10】Pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) is an intermediate metabolite of the gamma-glutamyl cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Both paracetamol and flucloxacillin interact with the gamma-glutamyl cycle as outlined below and in Figure 1 :\n\n【11】*   1) Paracetamol contributes to cysteine deficiency through direct conjugation.

Upon physical examination, the first mass measured 10 cm in the anterior aspect of the upper leg, with no inflammatory signs opposite.

There was no gender dominance. Usually, sarcomas develop between 6 months and 30 years following implant implantation, with a mean interval of 9 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In our case, the interval was 18 years. These sarcomas generally occur around the implant site in the bone or soft tissue adjacent. In terms of location, the femur is the most commonly affected bone, followed by the tibia, pelvis and humerus. In these locations, implanted material is quite frequent, which can explain this distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Histopathology, these tumors are high-grade sarcomas including pleomorphic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, chondrosarcoma and synovial sarcoma.

It is usually seen in the 6th and 7th decades. About 75% of these tumors occur in the soft tissues of the extremities mainly in the lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Typically, patients present with an enlarged, painless mass. In 5% of cases, metastases are found at initial presentation as seen in our patient. The primary treatment for these sarcomas is surgical resection en bloc with a margin of normal tissue of 1–2 cm around the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, in some cases, particularly lower extremity sarcomas, amputation is preferred over difficult reconstruction. Moreover, prosthetic techniques have evolved significantly in recent years, resulting in improved tolerance and excellent performance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Radiotherapy can reduce the risk of local recurrences whereas chemotherapy is usually reserved for metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Lastly, it is extremely rare for a malignant tumor to develop in association with an orthopedic implant. Nevertheless, physicians should be aware of this possibility, especially if new symptoms occur related to orthopedic implants.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nil.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare that they don’t have a conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient had given his written consent for publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The guarantor is Dr Abdellatif Benabbouha.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

After pericardial drainage for drug-resistant right heart failure, she developed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and cardiogenic shock caused by severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Findings during emergency surgery included tricuspid valve (TV) junction failure caused by shortening of the chordae tendineae of the TV, which is an organic abnormality. Additionally, myocardial biopsy results revealed myocarditis. Although acute myocarditis developed with RV dysfunction, pericardial effusion suppressed venous return, which temporarily improved her pathological condition. However, RV dysfunction and severe TR were thought to have manifested after the venous return suppression was alleviated by pericardial drainage. Because venous return changes significantly after pericardial drainage, it is necessary to examine the need for drainage and re-evaluate the post-operative RV system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pericardial effusion suppresses venous return, which may conceal right ventricular (RV) or tricuspid valve (TV) dysfunction. If pericardial drainage is performed for such cases, then increased venous return may reveal RV dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and the risk of cardiogenic shock may develop. We present the case of a patient with shortened chordae tendineae of the TV in whom pericardial effusion concealed severe TR. Drainage revealed TR, which was accompanied by RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with no apparent history of rheumatic fever and cardiac diseases presented with general malaise and was hospitalized. On admission, her blood pressure and pulse were 120/87 mmHg and 60 beats/minute, respectively. The blood test revealed the following results: brain natriuretic peptide, 186 pg/ml (reference, 0–18.4 pg/ml); cardiac troponin I, 0.038 ng/ml (reference, 0–0.025 ng/ml); creatinine kinase (CPK), 228 U/l (reference, 29–248 U/l); CPK-MB, 30 U/l (reference, 5–25 U/l) and C-reactive protein, 2.69 mg/dl (reference, 0–0.14 mg/dl). Furthermore, an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a marked PQ duration of 0.48 msec; however, no ST-segment elevation was noted by an 18-lead ECG. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal cardiac function and pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the RV and 18 mm around the left ventricle (LV).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|TTE at the time of admission; ( **A** ) Parasternal short-axis view: pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the right ventricle and 18 mm around the LV; ( **B** ) modified apical four-chamber view; TR insufficiency is unclear.</u>\n\n【7】There was no obvious evidence of valvular diseases, including TR. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) revealed pericardial and thoracoabdominal effusions . On the day of admission, her hemodynamic status was stable and treatment was initiated with diuretics. However, the next day, her symptoms worsened and urine output was poor; therefore, pericardial drainage was performed to remove 320 ml of yellow and turbid pericardial fluid. The subjective symptoms improved thereafter; however, she experienced cardiogenic shock the day after treatment. TTE revealed that the TV ring diameter had enlarged from 33 mm (at admission) to 45 mm and that severe TR had developed . Emergency catheterization was performed to evaluate hemodynamics, coronary artery lesions and valvular diseases. Swan–Ganz catheterization revealed cardiac output, cardiac index and SvO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.35 l/min, 1.68 l/min/m <sup>2 </sup> and 45%, respectively. Increased right atrial pressure and an increased v-wave were also observed . Right ventriculography  revealed a 30% decrease in the RV ejection fraction and severe TR (Seller’s classification grade 3). The coronary artery and LV ejection fraction were normal, and mild mitral regurgitation was noted. Furthermore, a myocardial biopsy of the RV septum was performed. Despite insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, her hemodynamic status did not improve. Because of circulatory failure caused by severe TR, TV replacement (TVR) surgery was performed (27 mm; MAGNA MITRAL EASE Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Intraoperatively, the chordae tendineae of the TV were markedly shortened . Thereafter, a biopsy revealed T-lymphocyte infiltration and myocardial fibrosis . The patient was diagnosed with acute myocarditis. She was discharged 45 days after admission and remained free of cardiovascular events for the next 3 years.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Thoracic and abdominal CT performed at admission; ( **A** ) moderate pericardial effusion and right pleural effusion at the transverse section; ( **B** ) moderate pericardial effusion at the coronal section.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|TTE after pericardial drainage; ( **A** ) apical four-chamber view: severe TR signal using Doppler echo with TV insufficiency during systole; ( **B** ) parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level: TV insufficiency during systole; a severe TR signal is noted secondary to TV insufficiency using Doppler echo.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Right ventriculography image obtained in the 30° right anterior oblique view shows a 5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted via the right femoral vein approach; the contrast concentrations in the right ventricle and right atrium appear nearly identical.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Intracardiac pressure waveform with a Swan–Ganz catheter; ( **A** ) the right atrial mean pressure is 15 mmHg; arrows indicate an increase in the v-wave height; ( **B** ) the RV systolic pressure is 34 mmHg, whereas the RV end-diastolic pressure is 15 mmHg; ( **C** ) the pulmonary artery pressure is 34/15 mmHg; ( **D** ) the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is 18 mmHg; ( **E** ) the LV systolic pressure is 123 mmHg, whereas the LV end-diastolic pressure is 20 mmHg; ( **F** ) the aortic pressure is 119/60 mmHg.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Surgical findings during TVR; ( **A** ) arrows indicate the shortened TV chordae tendineae; ( **B** ) the arrow indicates the shortened TV chordae tendineae; the chordae tendineae were shortened to the extent that the papillary muscle and leaflet were almost attached.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|Histopathological findings after RV myocardial biopsy; ( **A** ) infiltration of T lymphocytes and disappearance of cardiomyocytes are observed in some parts of the myocardial tissue; ( **B** ) enlarged image of the circled region in (A); vasculitis and fibrosis of the cardiomyocytes are observed.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】This case comprised underlying organic abnormalities of the chordae tendineae of the TV and incidental presentation with RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis. Pericardial drainage, which was performed as treatment, caused the TR and RV dysfunction to manifest and led to cardiogenic shock. Pericardial drainage reportedly causes preload variation before and after drainage in the right heart system, which is susceptible to pericardial cavity pressure; furthermore, the RV diastolic volume increases after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Compared to in the general population, the right heart system was more susceptible to venous return of this patient with shortened TV chordae tendineae, which led to the enlargement of the right heart system and severe TR caused by TV junction insufficiency. Acute myocarditis can be fatal, mainly because of pump failure and fatal arrhythmias secondary to LV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; however, RV dysfunction secondary to myocarditis alone can be serious in patients with organic abnormalities (such as TV tendon shortening). It should be noted that acute myocarditis causing only RV dysfunction may also cause hemodynamic instability.\n\n【17】Severe RV function and TV dysfunction have occurred after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient was at high risk because her symptoms worsened after admission and pericardial drainage was a priority. If the presence and severity of myocarditis could have been ascertained by gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; because of the possibility of acute myocarditis based on the presence of increased myocardial deviation enzymes and atrioventricular conduction delay on admission), then pericardial drainage might have been avoided. Colchicine administration is effective for pericardial effusion caused by pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, acute myocarditis was not diagnosed initially; TVR was performed to manage TV chordae tendineae shortening, which is an organic disorder. However, if the transient RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis had been an exacerbating factor, then medical therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would have improved the situation, and TVR might not have been necessary. For a previously reported case, medical therapy achieved an improvement in cardiogenic shock caused by RV dysfunction combined with TV dysfunction after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Conversely, TVR still may have been necessary for the present case because of the tendon abnormality.\n\n【18】TR is classified as primary and secondary. Primary TR, a structural abnormality of the TV, accounts for ~8% of all TR cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; possible causes include Epstein’s malformation, infective endocarditis, pacemaker leads, chest trauma and rheumatic fever. Conversely, congenital TR with structural abnormalities but without a history of these conditions has also been reported; some cases have been diagnosed at an advanced age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Our patient likely had congenital TR.\n\n【19】Pericardial drainage is necessary for the treatment and identification of the cause. If the TV involves an organic abnormality (as in this case), or if acute myocarditis has spread to the RV, then venous return will have a strong, negative hemodynamic effect. Screening with MRI and TTE may help reduce the risks of TR and RV dysfunction after pericardial drainage.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Institutional review board approval was not required for this case report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for the publication of this case was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Higuchi Motoaki.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The cyst measured 54.7 × 33.4 × 55.0 mm . Normal kidneys and bladder were identified and were separate from the cyst. The amniotic fluid volume was normal. A female infant weighing 3085 g was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks’ gestation. Apgar scores at 1- and 5-min were 8 and 9, respectively. She had poor oxygenation owing to diaphragmatic compression by a giant hepatic cyst and required respiratory assistance with continuous positive airway pressure. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a clear unilocular cyst measuring 98 × 60 × 32 mm and occupying the right side of the abdomen, extending from the inferior aspect of the right liver lobe to the pelvis . The infant’s respiratory condition gradually improved, but the hepatic cyst did not regress spontaneously. We decided that neonatal treatment was desirable because of the symptoms such as apneic attack related to pressure on related structures caused by the cyst, and performed ultrasound-guided percutaneous hepatic cyst puncture drainage when the infant was 15 days old. The fluid inside the liver cyst was clear and contained no bile components. There was no continuity with the bile duct. The liver cyst decreased in size, but rapidly re-grew. The infant’s respiratory status was unstable, and she fed poorly, owing to compression by the hepatic cyst; therefore, we performed fenestration of the hepatic cyst when she was 43 days old. We performed laparotomy via an umbilical arc incision and punctured and aspirated the hepatic cyst contents . The cyst was abducted from the umbilical region, and the cyst wall was excised with an ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device . Laparoscopy confirmed that there was no liver injury or biliary fistula . She received a single-dose of cefazolin intravenously as a prophylactic antibiotic before surgery. Histopathologically, hepatocytes and connective tissue were found in the outer layer of the cyst, and dilated capillaries and lymphatic vessels were scattered throughout. Immunohistologically, the cells supporting the cyst showed the CKAE1/AE3, D2-40, calretinin, WT-1 were positive and CD34 and hepatocyte-1 were negative . The diagnosis was mesothelial cell-derived hepatic cyst. After the surgery, there were no complications and no respiratory assistance was required. Breastfeeding was resumed on the first postoperative day. One year after the operation, CT showed regeneration of liver tissue .

His regular medications included apixaban 5 mg twice daily and digoxin 125 micrograms daily. He was normotensive, had a resting heart rate of 105/min and was afebrile. A systolic murmur was noted over the aortic area without radiation to the carotid area. There were no clinical signs of cardiac failure. Neurological examination demonstrated normal upper and lower limb tone, power, reflexes, sensation and coordination. Splinter haemorrhages were noted in his fingernails .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Splinter haemorrhages</u>\n\n【7】The patient is an electrician by occupation and there was no history of tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption or recreational drug usage. There was no family history of prothrombotic disorders, and he did not have any prior investigation for prothrombotic disorders when he was diagnosed with an unprovoked deep venous thrombosis 2 years prior.\n\n【8】His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, with no acute ischaemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle with mild global impairment of left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction of 45%). Serial high-sensitivity troponin I levels were elevated (320 ng/l and 288 ng/l, normal < 20 ng/l). Serum biochemistry, renal and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was 6.5 mg/l (normal < 5.0 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm/hour (normal 2–25 mm/hour).\n\n【9】Coronary angiography revealed slow flow in the distal LAD artery suggestive of a coronary artery embolism . Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated numerous foci of restricted diffusion, including two in the right parietal vertex and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere, consistent with embolic stroke . The intracranial cerebral arteries demonstrated normal flow and were of normal calibre. Suspecting an intracardiac source of embolism, the patient underwent transoesophageal echocardiography. This revealed a broad-based vegetation (14 mm at the base and 9 mm in thickness) attached to the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, with several frond-like mobile elements and moderate aortic valve regurgitation . There was no left atrial appendage thrombus. In the absence of septic features, NBTE was suspected. A procoagulant screen revealed strongly positive lupus anticoagulant tests (Russell’s viper venom and tissue thromboplastin inhibition) and elevated β2-glycoprotein antibodies (91 CU, normal 0–19). The patient had normal anti-cardiolipin IgM and IgG levels (<1 and 18 CU, respectively, normal 0–19 CU). Anti-nuclear antibody titre was positive (1:160; speckled and homogenous), but no other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus were present. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any evidence of malignancy nor pulmonary embolism.

A small vegetation noted on the P2 scallop of the mitral valve was also carefully excised. Pulmonary vein cryoablation and amputation of the left atrial appendage was performed. Histological examination of the excised aortic valve revealed hypocellular fibrinous material with organizing thrombus, and no evidence of acute inflammation, consistent with NBTE. Bacterial cultures were negative. Histological and cytogenic examination of a sampled mediastinal lymph nodes did not demonstrate any features of sarcoidosis or lymphoproliferative disease.

This patient had recurrent venous thromboembolism as well as NBTE, complicated by embolic ischaemic stroke and coronary artery embolism. Antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to mediate valvular damage by promoting the formation of fibrin-platelet thrombi on altered valve surfaces, which results in NBTE, often appearing as verrucous lesions on left-sided heart valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Whilst atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of systemic embolism, the absence of left atrial appendage thrombus and the presence of an aortic valve vegetation, suggests that his cardioembolic stroke was secondary to APS.\n\n【16】Unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin are recommended in the acute setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, although the optimum long-term strategy is uncertain.

A recent meta-analysis of four studies comparing DOACs to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with APS demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis (odds ratio 5.17), no increased risk in venous thrombosis and no difference in risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. VKAs remain the guideline-recommended treatment of choice in antiphospholipid syndrome, although current data do not specifically include patients with NBTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The role of surgical valvular intervention is uncertain. Surgical valve replacement or vegetation excision with valvular repair may be performed for significant valvular dysfunction or to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. In a contemporary cohort study of 42 patients, 10 patients (24%) underwent cardiac surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and 7 of them did not have a history of malignancy.

Olaparib, an oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic PC with a germline _BRCA_ mutation. In this report, we present the case of a metastatic PC harboring a germline _BRCA2_ mutation, and the daughter of the patient, who had bilateral breast cancers harboring the same germline mutation, suggesting that the PC was associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Although PC is an aggressive disease and has poor prognosis, olaparib was administered as maintenance therapy following modified FOLFIRINOX, providing clinical benefits for >12 months.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is fatal for more than 90% of patients, with approximately 70% succumbing to extensive metastatic disease and the remaining 30% dying from locally destructive PC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Smoking, obesity and diabetes are all risk factors for PC, and genetic factors account for 5–10% of PC cases. The majority of familial PCs are caused by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, which is caused by germline mutations in the _BRCA1/2_ , with _BRCA2_ mutations being the most common genetic alteration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】First-line systemic chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is administered based on performance status, the presence of germline or somatic mutations in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency-associated gene, comorbidity, serum bilirubin level and histological grade. If an HRR deficiency-associated gene mutation is present, FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin plus short-term infusion of fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin and irinotecan) or dose-modified FOLFIRINOX is administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor should be recommended for maintenance therapy rather than continued chemotherapy for patients with a germline _BRCA_ pathogenic variant who have no disease progression after at least 16 weeks of initial platinum-based chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ genes play a crucial role in directing high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In tumors with HR deficiency, such as those harboring _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ gene mutations, compensatory mechanisms fail to repair DNA damage, eventually accumulating damaged and unrepaired DNA and leading to cell death, a phenomenon known as synthetic lethality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Inhibition of PARP has demonstrated marked efficacy against not only breast cancer but also PC with HR deficiency due to defects in BRCA1, BRCA2 or other pathway components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Following the approval of olaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, in Japan on 28 December 2020, physicians have been able to prescribe olaparib to patients with metastatic PC harboring a germline BRCA pathogenic variant. In this report, we present a case of metastatic PC harboring a germline BRCA2 mutation associated with HBOC syndrome and exhibiting a favorable response to olaparib maintenance therapy.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 70-year-old man presented with lower back pain and weight loss. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography revealed an enhancing 37 mm mass in the pancreatic body with a suspicious invasion of the portal vein and tumor embolism in the splenic vein, but no distant metastases or notable lymph node enlargement. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed Class V PC. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were elevated to 27.5 ng/ml (normal range up to 5 ng/ml) and 1917 U/ml (normal range up to 37 U/ml), respectively. In November 2020, he was diagnosed with PC Stage IIA (T3N0M0) . His brother had gastric and prostatic cancers, and his sister had bilateral breast cancer. Five months before the diagnosis, his 38-year-old daughter was diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer and underwent bilateral mastectomy and BRACAnalysis (Myriad Genetics), which revealed a _BRCA2_ variant (c.7666\\_7667dupAA) . When he was diagnosed with PC, the gastroenterologist was unaware of his daughter’s _BRCA2_ variant. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the gastroenterologist received information about the genetic variant from his daughter’s doctor. The effect of neoadjuvant therapy indicated a partial tumor response, with CEA and CA19-9 levels rapidly declining prior to surgery . However, surgical resection was not completed because peritoneal dissemination was detected (i.e. Stage IV \\[T3N0M1\\]) immediately after the surgery started. Modified FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin \\[68 mg per square meter of body surface area\\], irinotecan \\[90 mg per square meter\\], leucovorin \\[200 mg per square meter\\] and fluorouracil \\[1500 mg per square meter\\] every 2 weeks) was then administered, and a BRACAnalysis revealed a _BRCA2_ variant (c.7666\\_7667dupAA). Three cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX were administered because of adverse events, such as anorexia, which did not allow the continuation of treatment till 16 weeks, the negligible effect of further dose reduction on the disease, and the fact that the patient strongly requested changing FOLFIRINOX administration. This led to the stabilization of the disease. Olaparib was then initiated as maintenance therapy, resulting in a continuous partial response over a 12 month treatment period, and CEA and CA19-9 levels gradually decreased over the next couple of months and remained within normal ranges . Two months after treatment, Grade 3 anemia was detected, and the olaparib dose was reduced to 300 mg based on the severity of the anemia . Grade 1 stomatitis was also detected. When the side effects alleviated, the dose was increased to 500 mg until they worsened again .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) A CT image presenting the pancreatic body tumor infiltrating the portal vein in the left panel.

The _BRCA_ genes encode proteins involved in the HR repair of double-strand DNA breaks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. _BRCA_ pathogenic variants are sensitive to PARP inhibition via multiple mechanisms, including PARP trapping on DNA at sites of single-strand breaks, which cannot be repaired accurately in tumors with HR repair defects, resulting in synthetic lethality. Therefore, PARP inhibitors cause an accumulation of DNA damage in tumor cells with a deficiency in DNA damage repair, resulting in tumor cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The PARP inhibitor olaparib has been shown to be clinically effective in patients with ovarian or breast cancer harboring a germline _BRCA_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Additionally, in a Phase III POLO trial, patients with metastatic PC who had a germline _BRCA_ mutation had not had progressive disease during platinum-based chemotherapy—of whom, more than 80% were receiving the FOLFIRINOX regimen—benefited from maintenance therapy with olaparib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of _BRCA2_ mutations identified in PC were frameshifting indels and splice-site mutations, whereas single point mutations are uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the present case, the pathogenic mutation c.7666\\_7667dupAA is located in coding exon 15 of the _BRCA2_ gene, causing a translational frameshift with a predicted alternate stop codon (p.N2556Kfs\\*93). This mutation was identified in a Japanese PC cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition to the clinical data presented in the literature, this alteration is expected to result in loss of function via premature protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n\n【15】Olaparib provided the patient with >12 months of partial response, while the median progression-free survival reached 7.4 months, with fatigue, nausea and anemia being the major adverse events, and the reported frequency of Grade 3 or higher anemia was 11% in the POLO trial. The patient reported herein had Grade 3 anemia, which was alleviated by lowering the olaparib dose. Olaparib is available in a tablet form, and no significant differences in the quality of life of patients have been reported between the olaparib group and placebo group in the POLO trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. FOLFIRINOX, a standard of care for metastatic PC, is a cytotoxic chemotherapy that is administered in the form of an infusion. Furthermore, the safety profile of FOLFIRINOX is less favorable than that of gemcitabine even though FOLFIRINOX significantly reduces quality of life impairment in patients with metastatic PC compared with gemcitabine. It has been reported that approximately 30% of patients had disease progression during their first 4 months of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The patient reported in the present study received a dose-reduced modified FOLFIRINOX from the initial cycle because of the risk of severe adverse events. Therefore, if the patient continued the modified FOLFIRINOX, achieving 12 months of disease control would not have been possible. Moreover, the patient did not meet the criteria for olaparib therapy as he had received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for only 8 weeks. However, it was an appropriate therapy in terms of the palliative treatment because the important goals in metastatic cancer therapy are a longer survival time, improvement of quality of life, and management of symptoms. Olaparib provided the patient with clinical benefits for >12 months and a better quality of life.\n\n【16】In the present report, the patient opted for a BRACAnalysis because a breast surgeon and a gastroenterologist were able to share information about his daughter‘s _BRCA2_ mutation on conversation, despite his remarkable family history of cancer. Therefore, along with clinician communication, it is critical that clinicians share genomic information on medical records or other systems that protect patients’ privacy and keep family histories up-to-date. Screening and early detection of cancer in this family with hereditary _BRCA2_ mutation can save other members in the future. Because the use of BRCA testing for cancer screening and tailoring cancer treatment has increased in the mainstream oncology practice, it may be important to build a genetic information management system and method so that clinicians should standardize BRCA testing practices.\n\n【17】In conclusion, as a maintenance therapy, olaparib was associated with a good response in patients with HBOC syndrome and a germline _BRCA2_ \\-mutated metastatic PC. Sharing genetic results of patients between clinicians is crucial for proper treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no funding sources to report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required for this study in accordance with local or national guidelines.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written informed consent for publication of this case, including images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ryoichi Matsunuma.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Most tachyarrhythmias related with thyrotoxicosis include sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, but an association between thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis and typical atrial flutter has seldomly been documented. Here, we present the case of a young male who was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis causing cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, successfully treated with diltiazem, propranolol, methimazole, potassium iodine (SSK) and rivaroxaban.\n\n【2】atrial flutterthyrotoxic periodic paralysisGraves’ disease\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Periodic paralysis is a rare muscle disease that manifests by painless muscle weakness often precipitated by heavy exercise, fasting or high-carbohydrate meals. It is classified as either hyperkalemic or hypokalemic, with the hypokalemic form being most associated with thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation but has less frequently been reported to induce atrial flutter.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 38-year-old Caucasian male with a history of essential hypertension on amlodipine presented to the hospital complaining of recent onset intermittent lower extremity weakness and palpitations. On examination, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 180 bpm, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 rpm, and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 167/92 mmHg. Neurologic exam revealed paraparesis with lower extremity strength of muscle power assessment (MRC) score 3/5. Initial laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia at 1.7 mEq/L (normal 3.4–5 mEq/L), and the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response . He was initially treated with oral metoprolol tartrate and oral diltiazem, but subsequently required initiation of a diltiazem drip at a rate of 15 mg/h. Thyroid laboratory workup revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.008 mU/L (normal 0.35–5.0 mU/L), free T4 level > 8 ng/dL (normal 0.8–1.5 ng/dL) and total T3 of 5.23 ng/mL (normal 0.6–1.81 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) based on the thyroid panel results, hypokalemia and clinical presentation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|12-lead ECG showed a rapid typical cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter and a rapid ventricular rate.

Moreover, therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was initiated regardless of a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points as the flutter was deemed to be induced by the thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【10】A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, revealing a normal left ventricle ejection fraction of 55% and no evidence of significant structural heart disease. Subsequent endocrine workup revealed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) elevated to 33.4 mU/L (normal 0.4–4.0 mU/L) consistent with the diagnosis of Graves’ disease (GD). Patient recovered normal neurological function with MRC 5/5 after 6 h of treatment initiation.\n\n【11】Therapeutic modalities that included radioactive iodine and surgery were discussed and deferred for the future. SSKI was discontinued after one week of treatment, and he was discharged and advised to continue methimazole for the following 12 months. He spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm 2 weeks after medical discharge without the need for electrical or pharmacological cardioversion after maintaining an adequate control of his hyperthyroidism.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Thyrotoxicosis is most associated with atrial fibrillation since thyroid hormone is known to have arrhythmogenic activity by acting on nuclear thyroid receptors and increasing sympathetic activity. Thyroid hormone upregulates the transcription of cardiac proteins, when acting on nuclear thyroid receptors. Thyroid hormones also exert an upregulating effect on the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to calcium release and a positive chronotropic/inotropic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most cases relating thyrotoxicosis to tachyarrhythmias usually refer to atrial fibrillation, but sustained atrial flutter rarely occur in these scenarios.\n\n【14】GD, known as the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroidal and extrathyroidal manifestations. Graves’ is caused by the formation of activating thyrotropin-receptor antibodies that induce thyroid hormone overproduction. Exacerbation of GD may lead to thyroid storm, a potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency, as well as TPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. TPP is another severe but rare complication with a reported incidence of 0.2% in North America and seen more frequently in males and Asians. It is characterized by muscle paralysis, and acute hypokalemia due to a potassium shift into muscle cells . Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is the variant most seen in patients with GD in association with acute thyrotoxicosis, TTP is a sporadic form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The most common arrhythmias related to TPP and HPP are sinus tachycardia, and first-degree atrioventricular block. However, atrial flutter has not previously been illustrated along these clinical scenarios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】When treating HPP, the goal is to address the symptoms caused by a hyperthyroid state and prevent recurrent attacks by controlling possible inducing factors. Despite the nomenclature, potassium reserves are normal in these patients. Supplementation is done to secure normal plasma levels of potassium. Intravenous potassium chloride is the first line of treatment for HPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In cases that proved resistant to this intervention, intravenous propranolol effectively managed the paralytic symptoms. The effectiveness of propranolol can be attributed to its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Antithyroid drug management is widely considered as the gold standard of therapy; however, radioiodine ablation is more prevalent as first-line in North America. Nevertheless, the underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Addressing the rhythm disorder can be divided into two steps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The first is managing rate control, which can be achieved using beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or amiodarone. The comorbidities should be considered when deciding on the agent to use. Propranolol has the advantage of reducing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution since they affect peripheral resistance, and patients with thyrotoxicosis already present with a low systemic vascular resistance.\n\n【18】Amiodarone can be considered since it has a double advantage by reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis due to its high iodine content, and exerting its antiarrhythmic properties by blocking potassium rectifying currents leading to an increase in action potential duration and a prolonged effective refractory period of the AV node 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The combination of properties can result in a more rapid resolution of symptoms in patients with arrhythmia secondary to thyrotoxicosis. On the other hand, amiodarone is rich in iodine and theoretically it may enhance thyrotoxicosis and type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more frequent in patients with underlying thyroid diseases such as GD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thioamides should be given 1 h before SSKI or amiodarone. The second step to consider is preventing the arrhythmia’s maintenance, which can be achieved with the long-term use of the agents discussed above as prophylaxis for recurrent attacks. In this case, propranolol would be the agent of choice.\n\n【19】Lastly, we decided to use prophylactic anticoagulation regardless a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points based on disagreement in the medical literature regarding the effectiveness of this strategy in patients with unknown duration of hyperthyroidism states, even more when transesophageal echocardiography is not pursued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】GD may lead to potentially life-threatening emergencies, such as thyroid storm or TPP. Cardiac testing is indicated in patients with thyrotoxicosis. The underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated accordingly. Propranolol is the beta-blocker of choice in cases of thyrotoxicosis. TPP can be a trigger for the development of sustained atrial flutter. In our case, appropriate treatment was associated with spontaneous resolution of the atrial flutter without the need for cardioversion or ablative intervention.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no relevant acknowledgment.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OR FUNDING\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This project was not supported by any grant or funding agencies.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This is a case report, IRB was not required.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient agreed with publication.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to manuscript writing and approved the final version.

We present a case of GBS as a rare complication of meningococcal meningitis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with a 1-day history of vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and back pain on the background of 2 days of coryzal symptoms. The patient was otherwise well with no significant medical history. The patient was married with an adult daughter. He was a manager of a car body repair business. He was a non-smoker and drank no more than one standard measure of alcohol in the form of beer per day. The patient had no contact with schools or college dormitories; did not have a complement deficiency; had not been given complement inhibitors eculizumab or rovelizumab; did not have hyposplenism, sickle cell disease or HIV infections and had not travelled to high risk areas like sub-Saharan Africa. He had no contract with a person infected with meningococcal disease.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was febrile, tachycardic and given empirical intravenous antibiotics, whereas in the Emergency Department his Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to 7/15 and he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit with the provisional diagnosis of meningitis.\n\n【7】He had a raised white cell count of 25.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L with disseminated intravascular coagulation (platelet count of 39.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and a raised INR at 1.6). A lumbar puncture could not be performed because of the coagulopathy; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, cell counts, glucose, cytology, culture and microscopy were unable to be measured. Blood cultures grew _Neisseria meningitidis_ , sensitive to rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone but was resistant to penicillin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/nucleic acid detection test (NAT) identified the organism as serotype _W N. meningitidis_ . He was put on IV ceftriaxone.\n\n【8】In the Emergency Department he had spontaneous movement of all four limbs. He had marked nuchal rigidity without skin rash. His second neurological assessment in the intensive care unit (ICU) revealed normal lower limb tone with decreased lower limb reflexes. On Day 1 of the admission, whilst intubated, the patient had spontaneous movement of the upper limbs but no movement of the lower limb. On Day 2 he was not responding by movement to painful stimuli of the lower limbs. This continued until he was extubated on Day 6. A formal neurological examination on Day 6 revealed areflexia, hypotonia and power of 0/5 in both lower limbs. Upper limb neurology was intact. The neurology team was consulted, and a formal assessment revealed hypotonia, areflexia and no movement of both lower limbs, with intact neurology in the upper limbs. The patient was suspected to have developed GBS after the _N. meningitidis_ infection and was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Nerve conduction studies revealed a severe predominant motor polyneuropathy with proximal nerve involvement. Active denervation was not identified in any muscle sampled. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine revealed T2 signal hyperintensity and enhancement of the cauda equina consistent with GBS . The spinal cord was normal. He was never given steroids. During his admission he developed minimal adduction and internal rotation of both lower limbs but remained areflexic. He was transferred to the neurosurgical service due to the development of ventriculitis for which he required an external ventricular drain. CSF from the drain confirmed serotype _W N. meningitidis_ on PCR/NAT. Modified Rankin Scale on transfer to the State Neurosurgical Service was 5, indicating severe disability.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Spinal cord showing T2 signal hyperintensity and enhancement of the cauda equina consistent with GBS.</u>\n\n【10】The reason as to why this previously healthy man should have developed meningococcaemia is unknown as he had no immunodeficiency, a normal spleen, normal immunoglobulins and lymphocyte numbers, including T and B cells.\n\n【11】The patient was discharged home after having spent 21 weeks in hospital. Upon review, he was able to shave himself and make tea and coffee. He could walk backwards 15 m with the gutter frame. His balance was improving. He could get up and out of the chair without assistance. He could move in and out of a motor vehicle. He could dress himself and brush his teeth. He was able to self-catheterize his urinary bladder four times per day. He did a manual evacuation of his bowels every couple of days. He had no feeling in the perianal region or the scrotum or the penis. He had pain in his hamstring muscles. He had pain from heel to toes, left greater than the right, like an electrocution. He could move his legs and lie down, and elevate them from the bed. He had bilateral extracranial hearing aids. He was able to crawl on his hands and knees. He had leg braces to support him when necessary. He had parasthaesias on the dorsum and balls of his feet. His toes were clawing. His hands were fully functional. His most recent weight was 78.3 kg—he was 76 kg when he left hospital. He could stand barefooted but not walk. He could balance and stand at a bench. He scored 3 on the Modified Rankin Scale, which is consistent with moderate disability. He has improved after 2 years since diagnosis to no significant disability—Modified Rankin Scale = 1.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】GBS is an immune-mediated condition characterized by rapid onset of paralysis.\n\n【14】GBS is generally triggered by an antecedent upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. Various pathogens such as _Campylobacter jejuni_ , _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr_ virus and _Varicella zoster_ virus have been associated with GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A novel finding raised by our patient is the presentation of GBS after a _N. meningitidis_ infection. Blood cultures and CSF PCR both identified _N. meningitidis_ as the preceding pathogen. Furthermore, PCR also excluded other simultaneous infections, indicating that the _N. meningitidis_ infection was the likely trigger to the patient’s subsequent GBS.\n\n【15】_N. meningitidis_ is a well-known cause of meningitis and sepsis which may lead to permanent neurological deficits; however, it has not been described as a trigger for GBS. The presumed mechanism for GBS after a _N. meningitidis_ infection is molecular mimicry as described for _C. jejuni_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】GBS has been suggested as a possible diagnosis in two previous patients with meningococcaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【18】GBS has been described extensively in the literature after a variety of infectious and inflammatory conditions—it has rarely been described after meningitis. Previous cases have described paralysis after meningitis; however, these cases had myelitis. Our patient is unique as he shows that GBS may be observed after meningitis and we report this patient to raise awareness of this complication amongst clinicians. Furthermore, although multiple bacterial and viral pathogens have been implicated in causing GBS, _N. meningitidis_ has not been previously identified as a trigger for GBS. Further cases are necessary to identify the mechanism by which GBS develops after a _N. meningitidis_ infection.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【20】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【21】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【22】This work was supported by Neurodegenerative Disorders Research Pty Ltd.\n\n【23】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【24】Not applicable.\n\n【25】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【26】The patient provided written informed consent for his case to be published.\n\n【27】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【28】Professor Peter K Panegyres.\n\n【29】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【30】P.K.P. diagnosed and treated the patient, and edited the manuscript to its final form; D.K. examined the patient and prepared the draft manuscript.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank patient MB and wife PB for participating in this research.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Presentation beyond childhood, however, is rare. We report, here, the case of a woman in her 50s who presented with an acutely obstructed posterolateral diaphragmatic hernia. The initial physical exam and radiological results could have led to an erroneous diagnosis of pneumothorax. We wish to emphasize the importance of having a high index of suspicion for this condition when cases with similar gastro-respiratory symptoms are encountered.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDHs) are a common entity with an incidence of one in 3000 births. The late fusion of the oesophagus and the septum transversum during development underlies the vulnerability for the development of CDHs. Ninety percent of CDHs are reported to involve the posterolateral aspects of the diaphragm as described by Bochdalek in 1848. Bochdalek hernias (BHs) are very rare beyond childhood with an incidence of 0.17% and are often incidentally discovered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Symptomatic hernias are misdiagnosed in up to 38% of cases leading to unnecessary interventions such as chest tube insertion or failure to diagnose which could lead to strangulation of the herniated content and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A woman in her 50s presented to our Emergency Department with a 5-day history of dull abdominal pain and vomiting which later started to be associated with streaks of blood. Two days before presentation she developed breathlessness which was aggravated by food intake and associated with intermittent episodes of dry cough and wheezes. She had no chronic conditions, had no surgery or trauma and was not taking any long-term medication. On examination, she was dyspneic and unable to lie flat. Her oxygen saturation was 94% on 4 L/min of oxygen. She had a respiratory rate of 30/min, a heart rate of 107/min and a blood pressure of 177/100 mmHg. She was afebrile. Chest physical examination revealed a hyper-resonant percussion note on the left side with decreased air entry and bilateral wheezes. Her abdomen was distended with a tympanic percussion note.\n\n【6】INVESTIGATIONS\n--------------\n\n【7】Her lab investigations showed total white blood cells count of 10.2109/L, heamoglobin 12.1 g/dl; renal and liver functions were within normal range. Her electrolytes were potassium 2.5 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L and her Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Her initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left-sided air-fluid level with a circumferential opacity and mediastinal shift to the right side; there was an initial impression of tension pneumothorax . But given the patient’s hemodynamic stability and radiologist advice, a computed tomography (CT) thoracic scan followed that showed a large left diaphragmatic hernia with the stomach and the spleen inside the left chest cavity causing significant mass effect with the result of total lung collapse .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CXR showing left-sided air fluid level.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|CT Thorax showing herniation of the stomach and spleen in the left chest cavity.</u>\n\n【10】DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n----------------------\n\n【11】The patient initially exhibited acute gastrointestinal symptoms pointing to an acute abdomen because of abdominal pain, vomiting and distension. The presentation to the hospital was associated with respiratory distress symptoms and signs on examination which could have led to a clinical misdiagnosis of tension pneumothorax at the early stages, but the patient’s hemodynamic stability allowed performing the CXR. The follow-up CT scan advised by the radiologist confirmed the diagnosis of an obstructed diaphragmatic hernia which would explain both the respiratory and gastrointestinal presentation.\n\n【12】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【13】Following the CT scan and confirmation of diagnosis, a nasogastric tube was inserted. This drained 1.5 L of fluid over 2 h with a large quantity of air. A considerable improvement in the patient’s respiratory distress was noted with the respiratory rate normalizing and a follow-up CXR showed a dramatic reduction in the size of the intrathoracic stomach with a matching lung re-expansion . She was brought to the operating room the following morning after appropriate resuscitation and electrolyte correction. The chest was entered via a seventh intercostal space leftposterolateral thoracotomy revealing a 5-cm defect in the left dome of the diaphragm with an incomplete hernia sac with the stomach, greater omentum and spleen incarcerated inside the chest cavity . Adhesions were released and the stomach, omentum and spleen were reduced into the abdominal cavity. The defect was primarily closed in two layers (double breasting). The patient was sent home on the fifth post-op day following an uneventful recovery. She was seen 6 weeks later and was doing well.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|CXR Post nasogastric tube suction with marked left lung re-expansion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Left posterolateral thoracotomy revealing herniated spleen, stomach and greater omentum.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】In their systematic review, Brown _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> showed that 78% of symptomatic BHs occur on the left side similar to our case. A precipitating factor such as pregnancy, chronic constipation and rigorous physical activity can be found in 25% of symptomatic patients, none were found in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Half of the patients present acutely with symptoms such as pain, pressure sensation in the abdomen or the chest, and symptoms of obstruction or pulmonary symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As these symptoms are ubiquitous, additional clinical clues would include postprandial respiratory symptoms, abdominal or thoracic symptoms aggravated by the supine position and abdominal symptoms aggravated by physical effort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The results of the physical exam in our case gave rise to a diagnosis of pneumothorax. This highlights the importance of a careful analysis of the patient’s symptoms. The most common radiological modality used to diagnose CDH is the CXR followed by the CT scan, which is the most accurate modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Nasogastric tube decompression is a common initial management step in obstructed Hiatal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Using the same approach here improved the patient’s symptoms and allowed the surgical procedure to be performed in more of a semi-elective setting. It is proposed, though rarely, that rupture of the hernial sac may be the initiator of the progression towards a symptomatic hernia. That could have been the case with our patient as a herniated incomplete sac was found. It is recommended to repair any diaphragmatic hernias discovered, irrespective of the symptoms. We used primary repair in our case. Brown _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> found that primary repair was the most performed with no reported recurrence.\n\n【18】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【19】Obstructed Bochdalek hernias rarely exhibits symptoms in adults and should be suspected whenever gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms intertwine to avoid potentially disastrous consequences.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Exploratory thoracotomy was performed, revealing an ~90° counter clockwise torsion of the left upper lobe (viewed facing the descending aorta from the right lung field) that resulted in lung discoloration.

The TC mostly affects males between the ages 30 to 50 years old at the ventral side of wrist. There are two different forms of TC that have been proposed in previous studies: an idiopathic cause (primary TC) and a joint related diseases cause (secondary TC). Even though trauma has been written to be a common reason for TC, a case of a secondary TC affecting the dorsal wrist following a triquetrum fracture has never been written before. The aim of this report is to present a rare case of a solitary post-traumatic TC at the dorsal wrist following a triquetrum fracture. We describe the clinical presentation, imaging modalities, histopathological and treatment challenges to manage this difficult lesion.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Synovial chondromatosis (SC) is a rare benign lesion of the synovium found in joints and tendon sheaths that undergo metaplasia leading to cartilaginous nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. The SC in joints usually involves large areas such as the knee and the hip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. If SC develops extra-articular in the tendon sheaths, it is referred to as tenosynovial chondromatosis (TC). The TC tends to occur in the fingers, feet and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Despite being a benign lesion, the synovium produced in TC can calcify, generate loose bodies and damage the adjacent cartilages or tendons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Laboratories studies were negative for rheumatologic disease. Radiographs revealed a partially calcified mass in the dorsal aspect of the wrist concerning for a possible osseous or cartilaginous lesion . A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right wrist showed an extensor tenosynovitis and a heterogenous lesion (measuring 2.6 × 1.3 × 2.5 cm) at the level of the first carpal row; suggestive for focal pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), soft tissue chondrosarcoma or TC .\n\n【10】After MRI results, an initial open intralesional biopsy was performed due to the assessment of an indeterminate soft tissue lesion with high probability of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

At surgery, patient was blocked with a supraclavicular anesthesia. A dorsal surgical incision was done at the previous initial biopsy site, along with a wide dissection of extensor tendons and extensor tenosynovectomy. The extensor retinaculum was surgically opened and a wrist joint arthrotomy was performed. At further exploration, a 2.2 × 1.3 cm soft tissue tannish trabeculated rubbery mass was excised from the carpus with an extensive curettage . The joint capsule was irrigated, and extensor retinaculum and adjacent tissues were rearranged for wound closure. Patient tolerated procedure without major complications. The pathology specimen was sent to National Institute of Health which revealed similar findings to initial biopsy, confirming a well-differentiated lesion consistent with TC.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Intraoperative view of right dorsal wrist with ( **A** ) mass bed and bony excavation and ( **B** ) extracted calcified mass.</u>\n\n【12】At 1-week postop visit, patient had significant improvement of associated pain symptoms, wounds healed appropriately, and an adequate hand ROM returned.

TC is a rare progressive benign tumor from the synovial lining of tendon sheath that mostly affects males between the ages 30 and 50 years old. The TC have been more commonly reported at the dorsal side of hand and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The exact pathogenesis of TC is unknown; however, it has been postulated that tendons undergo an initial neoplastic proliferation of cartilage tissue with hyperplasia in synovial and cartilage nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Two different forms can underly the differences of TC etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The primary TC relates an unknown etiology while the secondary TC involves previous history of osteoarthritis, osteochondral fractures or neuropathic arthropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of a TC is challenging due to the clinical and imaging variability presentation. Clinically, a wrist can present with swelling, pain, finger deformities and reduced ROM caused by compression of nearby structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A wrist X-ray can reveal calcification or ossification of cartilaginous nodules, bone erosion or have normal findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Additional imaging tools, such as MRI, play an excellent role in the location of loose bodies, proliferative synovium and extension of TC lesion prior to surgery. However, TC can be mistaken in MRI for other soft tissue conditions such as periosteal chondroma, PVNS and soft tissue chondrosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. In cases where there is an inconclusive diagnosis made by MRI, a biopsy with histological analysis remains the gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The standard treatment for TC is complete excision of the neoformation and adjacent synovium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Postoperative TC recurrence of the wrist has been reported in 3–23% of cases, requiring additional surgery for excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In cases where there is a high suspicion for a malignant soft tissue tumor of the wrist, an intralesional biopsy can be performed prior to the complete excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our patient, the involvement of loose bodies was not present at initial X-ray and MRIs; and a high suspicion of malignant soft tissue was noticed. Based on the imaging studies and the preference of the principal investigator, an intralesional biopsy was performed prior to an excisional biopsy.\n\n【20】A clinical diagnosis of secondary TC should be suspected in patients with history of prior wrist bone fracture. If clinical and imaging modalities are inconclusive for TC, an initial intralesional biopsy can be performed prior to the complete excision of the mass. After surgery, patients should be monitored regularly for possible recurrence of TC.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thanks to Dr. Edwin Portalatín for reviewing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING INFORMATION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Danny Mangual.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We report a 13-year-old male who presented with progressively increasing swellings at the right shoulder and right mid-thigh for one month. Radiological images revealed lytic destructive lesions associated with soft tissue masses in both sites and a pathological fracture on the right humerus. The patient had no significant medical history. Histological, immunohistochemical and fluorescent in-situ hybridization assessment of biopsies from the lesions confirmed the diagnosis of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the patient was unable to follow-up treatment and died shortly after establishment of the diagnosis. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is of serious concern when it comes to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone is defined as a malignant lymphoid neoplasm producing at least one mass within bone without the involvement of extra-regional lymph nodes and extra-nodal sites for at least 6 months. The presence however of regional lymph nodes in due course of the disease does not exclude the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The tumours are rare, comprising <1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Radiologically they have a wide variety of presentation, sometimes with a virtually normal X-ray with a large soft tissue mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The histological diagnosis of these lymphomas may be a daunting task related to the rarity of its presentation, thus scrupulous immunohistochemical studies are essential for the definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Herein, we report the case of a 13-year-old male with a primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone involving femur and humerus and a brief review of the literature.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 13-year-old boy was brought to our centre because of nearly simultaneously started swellings at the right shoulder and right mid-thigh with duration of 1 month. Each swelling was gradual in nature and progressively increased over time. The patient reported progressive weight loss and dizziness. His parents were peasants and his past medical history was unremarkable. Given the profession of the parents exposure to pesticides was considered, this could however not be documented.\n\n【6】On general examination, he was weak, pale, wasted and tachycardic with a pulse rate of136 beats/minute. Blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature were within normal limits. On local examination, he had a firm round, non-tender, immobile swelling (11 × 5 cm) at the right shoulder . At the right mid-thigh, he had a circumferential fixed and non-tender (12 × 10cm), Laboratory findings revealed the haemoglobin of 8.5 g/dl (11‑15 g/dl), raised ESR of 28 mm/h (0‑19 mm/1 h), normal leukocytes 6.13 × 109/L (4.00–11.00)/l and AST: 40.60 通用删除7(英):<u>(5–40)</u>/l. Serum creatinine 93 (62‑106 μmol/l), AST 40.60u/l (2.00–40.00 U/l), ALT 15.90 U/l (2.00–41.00 U/l). Other parameters including a bone marrow aspirate were essentially normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|A photograph showing swellings of the right shoulder ( **A** ), and right thigh ( **B** ) with surgical scars and suture marks in both following incision biopsies.</u>\n\n【8】Conventional radiography of the right femur demonstrated a huge soft tissue swelling with diffuse permeative lesions in the mid and distal femoral shaft and medial cortical destruction . The right shoulder revealed large soft tissue swelling associated with a pathological fracture of the proximal humerus, Chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvis ultrasound were normal i.e. no signs of metastasis seen. A diagnosis of sarcoma was suggested. Biopsies from the lesions were taken and the patient was discharged with a plan to start treatment in 2 weeks after establishing the histopathological diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|X-ray showing diffuse permeative lesion of mid and right distal femoral shaft associated with a large soft tissue mass ( **A** ), and right shoulder mass associated with proximal humeral destruction and a pathological fracture ( **B** ).</u>\n\n【10】Histopathological findings of the two lesions highlighted a similar morphology showing diffuse proliferation of monotonous medium to large-sized atypical lymphocytic cell population . Using the limited immunohistochemical panel tests that were locally available, tumour cells were strongly positive for CD20 and CD45 , but negative with CD99 and cytokeratin 20. Diagnosis of a primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone (DLBCL) with differential of Ewing sarcoma was made. Due to the rarity of the disease entity, tumour tissue blocks were shipped to Leiden University Medical Center, (Leiden, The Netherlands) for expert consultation. There, wider immunohistochemical panel tests and FISH for EWSR1 split, FUS split, BCOR split and CIC split were performed. All split-apart FISH showed the absence of split signals of tested genomic regions thus excluded the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma and other small blue round cell tumor (SBRCT). Immunohistochemical staining were conclusive for the diagnosis of DLBCL (CD45+, CD20+ while CD99, Desmin, MYOD1, PAS negative). The Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the patient could not manage to turn back for oncological treatment. Unfortunately, he succumbed ~30 days post-hospital discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Histopathology of the right-shoulder mass showing diffuse lymphoid cellular proliferation, H&E, ×40 primary magnification ( **A** ), and femur mass demonstrating a diffuse atypical lymphoid cell population, H& E, ×100 primary magnification.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Strong immunopositivity of the tumour cells with CD 45 IHC, ×40 primary magnification ( **A** ) and CD20 IHC ×60 primary magnification ( **B** ).</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Primary bone lymphoma is uncommon disease accounting for <5% of extranodal lymphoma and <1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Slight male preponderance has been documented and can occur at any age, with a mean age of 48 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–5 \\]</u>. The vast majority are B-cell lymphoma. Interestingly, these tumours can be mixed with reactive CD8+ T-cell infiltrates which can be confusing for recognizing it as a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The density of the CD8+ T-cell infiltration and expression of BCL2 has proven to be of prognostic value 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. At the tumour-genetic level, these lymphomas characteristically show a gain of chromosome 1q and amplification of 2p16.1 confirming their germinal centre-like phenotype and distinct makeup from other lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Any skeletal bone can be involved; however, femur and humerus have been reported frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>; as it was the case in or patient. Similarly, patients with these tumors present with bone pain, palpable mass pathologic fracture or neurologic symptoms with spine involvement without B-symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. The histological diagnosis of bone lymphoma may be very problematic especially in resources limited settings undoubtedly related to the rarity of its presentation. In their study, Heyning _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, on array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, they reported recurrent chromosomal alterations in primary diffuse large B cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The frequent radiological features include destructive lytic lesion with permeative margins associated with soft tissue mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Differential diagnosis at the H&E level includes Ewing sarcoma and other SBRCT especially at the age of the current patient. However, it should be noted that Ewing sarcoma is very rare among patients with African ancestry probably as a result of genetic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment of primary bone lymphoma may include a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while in contrast to nodal diffuse B-cell lymphoma the nuclear factor-kB does not seem to be an attractive therapeutic target 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Surgery is indicated only when there is fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Prognosis of the disease is relatively good with a 5-year-survival > 80% when treated with chemo-radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Factors associated with poor prognosis include advanced disease (>60 years) and site of mandible/maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had poor outcome probably due to late presentation coupled with delayed treatment. Because of anxiety related to novel COVID-19 pandemic, the patient opted to stay at home postponing treatment. Delaying chemotherapy could lead to upstaging of the tumour while delaying palliative chemotherapy could lead to worsening of quality of life.\n\n【17】Primary bone lymphoma especially in African paediatric population is rare. Delay in diagnosis and treatment as it was the case in our patient is of concern when it comes to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease. Clinicians should have a suspicion of index for unusual cases and thus vigorously work-up including proper and timely diagnosis for optimal patient care.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the parents of the patient for allowing us to use their son’s medical information for academic purposes.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declared that no conflicting interests exist.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None was received.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Agreement by the patient’s parents was obtained prior to submission of the manuscript and noted in patient’s chart.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Alex Mremi is the guarantor of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although most patients with a PFO are asymptomatic, various clinical manifestations may be associated with PFO. The most important is a cryptogenic stroke. Concomitant acute pulmonary embolism (APE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to paradoxical embolism from a PFO are extremely rare. We describe a 77-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension who was transferred due to a sudden onset of dyspnea followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Based on the patient’s medical history, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, coronary angiography, and a whole-body contrasted computed tomography, we diagnosed concomitant APE, AMI and AIS caused by a paradoxical embolism from a PFO. Appropriate knowledge of the pathophysiology of this rare critical illness is important for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A patent foramen ovale (PFO) occurs in ~20–30% of the general population and is a major cause of paradoxical embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A possible mechanism for PFO-related systemic embolic events is a paradoxical embolism, a thrombus from the peripheral venous system that crosses an interatrial defect into the systemic circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is rare to find acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to paradoxical embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and its incidence has been reported as <1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although several AMI cases studies alone or with concomitant AMI and acute pulmonary embolism (APE) with paradoxical embolism due to a PFO have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>, concomitant AMI, APE and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) resulting in cardiac arrest are extremely rare. We describe a case of a patient with paradoxical embolism as concomitant APE, AMI and AIS. The patient’s medical history suggested that APE caused cardiac arrest, and pulmonary hypertension from APE led to a right-to-left shunt due to the PFO, which resulted in AMI and AIS.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension felt severe dyspnea after waking up in the morning and called emergency medical services. When the paramedics arrived, she had collapsed, and an electrocardiogram revealed asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, and she was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital. The return of spontaneous circulation was confirmed 60 minutes after her collapse. Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asynergy of left ventricle lower wall motion, left ventricular retraction due to right ventricle dilation (D-shape); tricuspid regurgitation (TR) flow was 3.1 m/sec, and the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient (TR-PG) was 38.7 mmHg . In addition, regional wall motion abnormality of the basal and mid right ventricular free wall with apical hyper contractility (McConnell’s sign) was observed. Based on these findings, he was suspected to have an AMI complicated by an APE. An emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI was performed. Coronary angiography revealed 100% thrombus occlusion of the distal segment of the right coronary artery (RCA, 4PD) and no obvious stenosis of the other coronary arteries. Balloon dilatation and thrombus aspiration provided complete reperfusion with Grade 3 TIMI blood flow for 4PD occlusion without stenting . A subsequent whole-body computed tomography (CT) was performed to look for thrombosis and determine the cause of the pulmonary embolism. A contrasted chest CT revealed filling defects in the right peripheral pulmonary artery , and bilateral deep vein thrombosis was found in the lower limbs. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for post-resuscitation management. Initially, a right-to-left shunt involved in the mechanism of the concurrent AMI and APE was suspected. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a PFO and blood flow from the right to the left atrium . Despite the absence of sedation and stable hemodynamics, she remained unconscious. The brain CT did not show an abnormality on admission; however, a follow-up brain CT revealed hypodensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres on Day 4 . Based on these findings, we diagnosed APE, AMI and AIS. The suspected mechanism of these multiple embolisms was paradoxical embolism due to a PFO. We administered intravenous heparin for her multiple thrombi. Although there was possibility to be underlying some malignancy and PFO closure was a curative treatment, because of her severe neurological dysfunction caused by the ischemic stroke, no further tests were performed and her family did not consent to PFO closure. She left the intensive care unit on Day 9 and was discharged from the hospital on Day 53 with supportive care taking edoxaban 30 mg daily.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiography shows left ventricular retraction due to right ventricular dilation ( **A** ).

Deep venous thrombus led to APE and caused pulmonary hypertension, which elevated right atrial pressure. The elevated right atrial pressure opened a PFO and caused a right-to-left shunt. The residual thrombus crossed the PFO from the right to the left atrium and entered the arterial circulation, causing an embolic myocardial infarction. Her sudden onset of dyspnea without chest pain and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest with asystole suggested APE than typical AMI. The transthoracic and esophageal echocardiogram and the coronary angiography findings suggested these hypotheses. Subsequent AMI was explained by paradoxical embolism due to a PFO with elevated right atrial pressure. The AIS in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres was suggestive of a watershed infarct and may have been caused by global hypoperfusion, presumably at the time of cardiac arrest due to AMI and APE. It was reasonable to assume that these APE, AMI and AIS had developed in this sequence of events.\n\n【11】Anti-thrombotic therapy such as tissue plasminogen activator should be considered first treatment when patients present with concomitant AMI and APE. However, we could not administer anti-thrombotic drugs because she had a high risk of bleeding related to pulmonary contusion after chest compressions in this case. Therefore, we decided to perform PCI because usage of intravenous heparin for underlying the catheterization can be treated with pulmonary embolism simultaneously. In addition, if the patient’s condition deteriorates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used safely in the catheterization laboratory. The administration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thrombosis and PFO closure is secondary prevention for paradoxical embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although theoretically it may help prevent further recurrence of paradoxical embolism, a PFO may serve to offset the elevated right atrial pressure and maintain cardiac output at the expense of low systemic saturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Little evidence exists to guide the decision to close a PFO in such a situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Prompt clinical diagnosis and targeted therapies adapted for the specific clinical presentation may have averted a fatal outcome.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Kiyoshi Takemoto.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

He was hypotensive and an echocardiogram showed large extra-cardiac mass compressing the right ventricular outflow tract resulting in features of cardiac tamponade. Chest computed tomography revealed a mediastinal mass invading the pericardium adjacent to right ventricular outflow tract. Biopsy of the mass confirmed primary monophasic synovial sarcoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy along with anti-inflammatories were given as surgery was too high risk due to the location of the tumour and pericardial involvement. Patient responded briefly to the treatment with improvement in hemodynamic parameters but over next weeks he became less responsive to treatment with increasing size. He died 2 months after treatment commenced.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Synovial sarcomas are very rare soft tissue tumours derived from primitive pluripotent mesenchyme capable of epithelial differentiation presenting in adolescents and young adults. Primary origin in thorax is extremely rare, accounting for <1% of all malignancies in thorax and more prevalent in adults between 20 and 40 years old. Synovial sarcoma usually occurs in deep soft tissue of the extremities with metastasis to the thorax and abdomen. We report a rare case of mediastinal monophasic synovial sarcoma with pericardial involvement causing compression of right ventricle and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) leading to hemodynamic compromise.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 46-year-old man was referred for a chest X-ray following 6-month history of worsening dyspnoea, dry cough, night sweats, intermittent pyrexia and weight loss of 6 kg. The chest X-ray showed a large mass extending from the mediastinum to the left lateral chest. Laboratory blood tests showed a normocytic anaemia picture with a haemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(13–18)</u>, raised ALP at 205 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–130)</u> and GGT 350 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–55)</u>. Vitals signs recorded heart rate at 104 per minute, blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg, saturation of 94% on room air, and respiratory rate of 24 per minute. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of electrical alternans and pulsus paradoxus was 24 mmHg.\n\n【6】The patient subsequently had a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed localized pericardial effusion in the antero-apical region with maximum dimension of 2.5 cm. A mass was seen within the pericardial space near the RVOT compressing it. Flow turbulence was noted on colour Doppler along with acceleration of 1.5 m/s in the RVOT and in pulmonary trunk.\n\n【7】Urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a solid lobular left hemithorax mass measuring 17.6 × 11.0 × 18 cm causing significant displacement of mediastinal structures to the right. There was invasion into the pericardial cavity, with associated pericardial effusion .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Computerized tomography of the chest: sagittal and transverse views showing marked extrinsic constriction of the RVOT</u>\n\n【9】A biopsy of the mass showed tissue infiltrated with spindle cell tumour of monomorphic appearance consisting of densely packed cells with fine chromatin pattern, partially overlapping nuclei and scanty cytoplasm . Immuneprofile revealed a strongly positive CD56 and focally positive epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed rearrangement of SS18 locus (SYT gene) at 18q:11.2 chromosome within spindle cells pericytomatous blood vessels are present. The above features were morphologically and immuneprofile consistent with monophasic sarcoma of Trojani Grade 2 . He was reviewed by Oncology specialists who started him on Dexamethasone initially to reduce reactive inflammation to improve his hemodynamics and symptoms. Pulsus paradoxus improved within 48 h allowing for more treatment to commence. Following a case discussion at the multidisciplinary team meeting, he received chemotherapy initially with Liposomal Doxorubicin for cycle one with addition of Iphosphamide for cycle 2. He was to be considered for surgical resection of the tumour following the second cycle with the expectation of tumour shrink. Unfortunately, the patient died following 2 months of chemotherapy due to severe aggression of the tumour and failure of response to treatment.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) 3D CT chest reconstruction showing marked hypervascularity of the synovial sarcoma and the resulting compression of RV and RVOT.

This case presented with hemodynamic instability similar to cardiac tamponade due to effusion. Pericardiocentesis of the localized moderate effusion was not possible as the approach was obscured by the sarcoma. The reduction in swelling improved his blood pressure and pulsus paradoxus without any invasive treatment.\n\n【13】Synovial sarcomas are very rare soft tissue tumours derived from primitive pluripotent mesenchyme capable of epithelial differentiation presenting in adolescents and young adults. Primary origin in thorax is extremely rare, accounting for <1% of all malignancies in the thorax and more prevalent in adults between 20 and 40 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Synovial sarcoma usually occurs in deep soft tissue of the extremities with metastasis to the thorax and abdomen. There are four morphological types of synovial sarcoma—biphasic, monophasic, monophasic epithelial and poorly differentiated tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The biomarkers for these tumours include Vimentin, Cytokeratin and EMA positivity with EMA being the most common positive marker.

His white blood cell count, CA 19-9 level, and CEA level were within the normal range. However, his interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) level was slightly elevated (516 U/ml). He underwent an abdominal computed tomography with contrast, which showed full-thickness wall thickening at the ileocecal region. He had no intestinal obstruction. He underwent a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. No tumor was found at the ileocecal valve, and macroscopic findings were normal.\n\n【3】An attempt was made to advance the lower gastrointestinal endoscope superior to the ileocecal valve. However, the scope was unable to advance beyond the terminal ileum due to narrowing. When the scope was advanced to the cecum, an additional outpouching was found . The patient underwent a gastrointestinal angiography. The proximal ileum and the narrowed terminal ileum were imaged . The ulcer appeared to be an ileocecal fistula. A biopsy was performed and the pathological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A lower gastrointestinal endoscopy 2 months prior, which was performed by another doctor, showed no abnormalities. It is possible that the terminal ileum and the cecum were not observed only by confirming the ileocecal valve. We experienced a case in which DLBCL pierced the gastrointestinal tract to form an ileocecal fistula, ‘a pseudo-ileocecal valve’. He underwent ileocecal resection.

However, incidental cystic masses were seen adjacent to the right and left atrial free walls . Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging  and computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA)  demonstrated giant aneurysms with circumferential intramural thrombus of the right coronary (RCA) and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries; with saccular aneurysm of the proximal left circumflex (LCx) artery. On steady state free precision (SSFP) 4-chamber image of CMR, the round hypointense cross cut image of the giant RCA and LCx aneurysms appeared to resemble a mouse’s ears. Despite their sizes, the aneurysms did not cause compression to the adjacent cardiac chambers. There was no demonstrable late gadolinium enhancement in all coronary segments, which excluded evidence of myocardial infarction.

Multiple giant aneurysms involving all three coronary arteries are even rarer. CAA refers to vascular dilatation exceeding the normal diameter of the adjacent coronary segment or 1.5 times larger than the diameter of the largest coronary artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When it is beyond 20 mm in diameter, it is called giant aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most common aetiology of CAAs is atherosclerosis. Other causes include congenital, Kawasaki disease, trauma (including coronary angioplasty), Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, syphilitic aortitis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet disease and fibromuscular dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our patient, the aetiology could be undiagnosed childhood Kawasaki disease or congenital, in view of presence of multiple thoracic cavernous hemangioma seen on CTA and negative serology investigations.\n\n【12】The majority of patients with CAA are asymptomatic. Other than short duration of reduced effort tolerance which was most likely due to his lung infection, our patient was symptom-free. Those who are symptomatic may present with symptoms of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden death, fistula formation, hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, compression of surrounding structures or even congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】At present, there is no standard management guideline of CAA since the incidence is scarce. The choice of optimal therapy is still unknown and controversial. The available treatment options include medical therapy, percutaneous intervention (PCI) and surgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The choice is tailored to the clinical situation of the particular patient. In asymptomatic patients, medical therapy with antiplatelet and/ or anticoagulant drugs are usually chosen to prevent thromboembolic complications. Surgical management is normally reserved for patients symptomatic of obstructive coronary artery disease or embolic phenomena which highly predispose to myocardial ischaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

She presented to her general practitioner (GP) who treated her for a urinary tract infection due to microscopic haematuria.\n\n【12】She represented to her GP 1 week later with persistent symptoms and a new rash on her lower legs . She was otherwise fit and well. Regular medications were ramipril and atorvastatin. She had hypertension. There was no personal or family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and no recent travel history. She had no evidence of dyslipidaemia and a normal body mass index.\n\n【13】She was referred to secondary care after blood tests revealed a platelet count of 25 × 10^9/l (baseline platelet count was 299 × 10^9/l).\n\n【14】Observations showed a heart rate of 117 beats/minute, apyrexial, saturating 96% on room air. Examination confirmed a lower limb diffuse petechial rash and peripheral bruising.\n\n【15】Significant bloods were a platelet count of 22 109/l (Ref. range: 135–450/l), markedly elevated d-dimer of 23 704 ng/ml (Ref. range: 0–500/l) and a fibrinogen count of 1.5 g/l (Ref. range: 2–4.5 g/l). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the patient had antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes.\n\n【16】Computed tomography (CT) of head revealed no abnormality, while CT of venogram showed an apparent filling defect extending within the right sigmoid sinus concerning of venous sinus thrombosis with the possibility of arachnoid granulation. Additionally, there were features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with stenosis of the transverse sinuses bilaterally.\n\n【17】Due to the high suspicion of VITT, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was commenced at 1 g/kg with a second dose at 0.5 mg/kg and combined with oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg. Fondaparinux of 2.5 mg OD was started.\n\n【18】She underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head and venogram to confirm the CT findings. The initial report concluded that the filling defect noted on CT in the right sigmoid sinus was likely a slight granulation rather than thrombus. However, in view of the clinical suspicion of VITT, a second opinion was sought and the MRV was reported as suggestive of a small-volume venous sinus thrombosis . Fondaparinux was increased to 7.5 mg OD.\n\n【19】Due to the rarity of this complication, her case was discussed with a tertiary centre who advised to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【20】CTPA confirmed a right-sided subsegmental pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of mesenteric or portal venous thrombosis. Concurrently, she underwent a ultrasound doppler of her right leg due to swelling, which ruled out a deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【21】Platelet levels began to improve significantly after the second dose of IVIG  and her symptoms improved. Fondaparinux was continued (4 days total) until discharge.\n\n【22】She was then started on apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 1 week, which was reduced to 5 mg twice daily, and on a prednisolone weaning regimen. Weekly blood tests showed her platelet counts remained within normal limits and her d-dimer had normalized (d-dimer levels of 23 704–376 after 21 days between 13 April and 11 May). She remains on long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】This report describes a case of VITT post-administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine in a 55-year-old woman with no history or risk factors for VTE.\n\n【25】This case, as well as other reported incidences, appear to be specific for vaccination. A study in Norway reported that after 132 686 first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were administered, five patients were admitted to hospital after 7–10 days after receiving the dose with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. All five patients had significantly high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies to PF4 and platelet activation, with no prior exposure to heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The association between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the risk of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events was also assessed in a study using patient level data for ~29 million people vaccinated in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. An increased risk of thrombocytopenia after the AstraZeneca vaccine and increased risk of VTE and CVST were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The features in these cases share similarities with heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT). In HITT, platelet-activating antibodies develop after exposure to heparin, which leads to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In VITT, it is suspected that cationic PF4 becomes bound with an anionic molecule produced by the cells at the vaccination site or in the vaccine, which then induces antibody formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These antibodies then bind to platelets via the Fc gamma RIIA receptors which leads to platelet activation, as in HITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The thrombosis progresses rapidly and has a high disposition at unusual sites, including CVST or the hepatic or portal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In previous cases, patients had also presented with DVT, arterial thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In previous reports of VITT, few patients had a history of thromboembolic events as seen in our case where the patient had no risk factors for VTE and had a low-risk status. Importantly, almost all patients had significant levels of PF4 antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically, the main features seen in these patients present 5–30 days after vaccination and include thrombocytopaenia, thrombosis and raised d-dimer levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current diagnostic criteria categorizes patients into unlikely, possible, probable and definite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Anticoagulation is currently the first treatment in probable or definite cases of VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. IVIG is also used as immunosuppression. After administration, platelet counts rise, and markers of hypercoagulability improve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that serial blood samples obtained in VITT patients before and after two/three doses of IVIG have demonstrated reversion to a weaker or negative PF4-enhanced SRA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Observational data support the concept that high-dose IVIG is effective in VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Corticosteroids may be used if IVIG is not available; similar to the management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where corticosteroids are believed to raise the platelet count by decreasing clearance of antibody-coated platelets by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Platelet transfusion was avoided due to the risk of progression of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dose therapy effects in our case was evidenced by improving d-dimer, platelets and fibrinogen.\n\n【32】This case highlights the importance of liaising across specialist centres, which, in our case, advised further imaging to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【33】Ultimately, this case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, management and monitoring. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of VITT after vaccination. As patients with CVST and/or thrombosis due to VITT can become acutely unwell despite initially appearing to be stable, close monitoring is essential.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr Rebecca Spendiff, Colchester general hospital, for providing imaging.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained by the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Saad (SA) Ahmed—Acute Medicine, Colchester Hospital, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Turner Rd, Colchester CO4 5JL, UK.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In neonates, tick paralysis may present only as generalized weakness and lethargy with poor feeding.

Tick paralysis in humans is rare and usually occurs in children under the age of 10, but has never been reported in the early neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Tick paralysis occurs when an engorged and gravid (egg-laden) female tick injects the neurotoxin present in its saliva into the host during feeding. Tick paralysis is toxin induced and therefore continues only in its presence. Once the tick is removed, symptoms usually diminish rapidly. However, in some cases, profound paralysis can develop and even become fatal if a tick’s presence is missed and not completely removed. The tick bites are most often found at the head and often at the hair lines behind the ears and in the skin folds. The clinical presentation may start between 2 and 7 days after the bite and appears as typical ascending flaccid paralysis in children and poor feeding and/or lethargy in neonates. After a prodromal phase, neurological symptoms begin with paralysis of the lower extremities along with weak/absent deep tendon reflexes. Paralysis progresses over few hours to a day to involve the upper extremities, cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. If the tick is not identified, located and removed it may lead to death due to respiratory failure. Sensory findings are generally absent and therefore form an important differential diagnosis in motor neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, infant botulism and diphtheria. In tick bites mental status is typically normal and fever is absent.\n\n【6】Tick bites in early neonatal period have never been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. We describe the first case of tick paralysis in the early neonatal period.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A male baby was delivered in a primary health center at term gestation via normal vaginal delivery and weighed 2.5 kg. He cried at birth, did not require any resuscitation and was discharged on Day 2 of life. On Day 3 he was diagnosed with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 20.6 mg/dl and direct bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dl) and hence was referred to our center. We started intensive phototherapy. He was discharged on Day 5 of life with normal bilirubin levels (total bilirubin: 9.6 mg/dl and direct bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dl). On Day 9 of life parents brought the newborn to our center with complaints of poor feeding, lethargy and reduced activity since 6 h, and with yellowish discoloration of hands and legs since 2 days. On examination it was found that the baby was hemodynamically stable (heart rate: 120 beats per minute, peripheral pulses: well felt, capillary refill time: <3 s and warm peripheries) with normoglycemia (Random blood sugar: 98 mg/dl) and normal body temperature (36.6°C). Icterus was noted till knees and elbows with no evidence of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND). Neurological examination showed drowsiness and lethargy. Glasgow Coma Scale score was nine (eye opening on pain, withdrawing from pain and crying to pain). Pupils were equal and reactive. Anterior fontanelle was level with normal cry. Poor latching and sucking was noted. Generalized hypotonia of all four limbs was noted with a poor respiratory effort. Deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive. No seizures or neck retractions were noted. No cranial nerve deficits were noted.\n\n【9】Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin: 15.8 gm/%, total count: 7300 cells/cumm, differential count: neutrophils (63%), lymphocytes (37%), platelet count: 2.9 lakh/cumm, C-reactive protein: 0.5 mg/l, total bilirubin: 12 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 0.4 mg/dl, sodium: 138 mEq/l, potassium: 4.8 mEq/l, total protein: 5.5 gm/dl, albumin: 3.5 gm/dl, AST: 50u/l, ALT: 36 u/l and GRBS: 98 mg/dl.\n\n【10】We admitted the baby to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where a re-examination was done. An engorged tick was found attached under the chin of the baby. The tick was removed by grasping it with forceps close to the body and pulling it out with steady upward outward pressure. No part of the tick was left behind. The tick was found to be of Haemaphysalis species which is common in this area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. With the removal of the tick, the baby improved dramatically within few hours. We started maintenance fluids until breast feeding was re-established. Although incidence of Lyme disease is low in India, we initiated a prophylactic dose of amoxicillin for 14 days. Baby was discharged after 3 days of in-patient care and was kept on follow-up since incidence of Kyasanur Forest disease is high in our region. Kyasanur forest disease is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to south-western part of India. On follow-up after 2 weeks the baby was doing well and gaining weight.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Studies carried out by Prakasan _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> suggested Haemaphysalis species belonging to the ixodes tick genus is the most prevalent among domestic animals in Wayand district of Kerala. Signs and symptoms of tick paralysis have generally been described in older children and adults and never in a neonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 5 \\]</u>. A recent case report by John _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> identified an ixodes tick in a 4-year-old child with eyelid swelling. The symptoms usually begin with fatigue, poor feeding and lethargy. Ascending paralysis rapidly progresses within hours to 1 day to involve the upper extremities, cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. If the tick is not removed in time, it can be fatal due to respiratory failure. Sensory changes are typically rare and the mental status is normal. Fever is typically absent. There is no toxin assay and imaging is normal. Because of these reasons the diagnosis is clinical. Rapid improvement of the patient once the engorged tick is removed should confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves simply removing the feeding tick. It is important to remove all the mouthparts, since they contain the salivary glands which may continue to intoxicate the patient even after the main body of the tick has been removed.\n\n【13】Tick bites in neonates mimic clinical signs and symptoms typical of other neonatal infections like fever/hypothermia, irritability and poor feeding. Tick-borne intoxication should therefore be considered when a neonate coming from an endemic region has clinical findings suggesting neonatal infections with normal blood counts. Neuropathies such as Guillian Barre Syndrome, infant botulism and diphtheria should also be ruled out. History of witnessed tick bites and recent family or pet exposures to ticks provide helpful information. Examination findings may reveal diagnostic clues. Variety of skin rash may develop at the bite site. Identification of a tick is typically adequate to diagnose.\n\n【14】Much remains unknown about neonatal tick-borne infections. The signs and symptoms in our patient who presented with a short clinical course, lack of clinically validated tests for tick-borne intoxication (tick toxicosis) in the neonatal period and rapid improvement on removal of the tick tell us about the importance of a thorough clinical examination in similar situations. In presenting this case, we aim to provide guidance to other clinicians.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】As tick-borne infections become more prevalent, we expect other clinicians will face similarly challenging neonatal cases. Providers must use past experience and a keen eye to identify ticks in neonates to rule out other conditions with similar presentation. Delayed diagnosis is detrimental and so early treatment is very necessary to prevent a critical outcome.\n\n【17】CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES (INCLUDES FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\n【19】FUNDING/SUPPORT\n---------------\n\n【20】No funding was secured for this study.\n\n【21】ROLE OF FUNDER/SPONSOR (IF ANY)\n-------------------------------\n\n【22】No funding was secured for this study.\n\n【23】CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION (IF ANY)\n------------------------------------\n\n【24】Not a clinical trial.\n\n【25】ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------\n\n【26】1.

In her medical history, the girl was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 8 years before by MEFV mutation. The patient’s symptoms were controlled by colchicine (0.07 mg/kg/day) with the last attack a year ago. Upon physical examination, the patient was alert, without distress, and all her vital signs were within the normal average. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-distended, non-tender abdomen. The abdominal radiography showed a radiopaque foreign body in the right lower quadrant . As the physical exam was normal and the foreign body was not causing obstruction, it was predicted that it will pass through spontaneously without any complications and the patient was discharged with instructions for getting abdominal X-rays as an outer patient for follow-up. A week later the patient had episodes of colicky abdominal pain around the umbilicus without any other symptoms. There were not any remarkable signs in the abdominal examination except for a mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There was no palpable mass, and the bowel sounds were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Highly echogenic, linear metallic foreign body.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|(a) An appendix with trapped pin.

The white blood cell count was 8500 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> , differential count polymorphs 45%, lymphocytes 50% and platelets (PLT) 450 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen were normal. Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant, which was in the same location that the prior abdominal radiography showed. An abdominal ultrasound scan was requested which revealed highly echogenic, the linear metallic foreign body within a slightly swollen appendix .\n\n【13】Because the pin was trapped in the appendix with difficultly to pass through and to avoid further complications such as inflammation or perforation, the patient was taken up for surgery. During surgery a sharp pin was found to be trapped in the appendix with no signs of inflammation or perforation. The procedure completed as prophylactic appendectomy .\n\n【14】The patient was discharged the next day after surgery, with no postoperative complications.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Most of the FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously within a week and do not cause any complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In rare cases, the foreign body tends to be trapped in the appendix which is attributable to an inferior anatomical location, angulation or narrowing and remains stagnant as a result of the inability to return it to a normal pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Rare cases in which a foreign body in the appendix has not generated inflammation have been described in the literature. The first reported appendectomy was in 1735 by Amyand, a London surgeon who removed an appendix perforated by a pin from an 11-year-old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. More than 250 cases of appendiceal foreign bodies have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Clinical signs of FBs depend on their size, shape and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Some cases may be asymptomatic, while others if the object is thin, sharp or metallic up to 93% of the patients may experience symptoms like abdominal pain and low-grade fever, with or without vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In the asymptomatic patient, a serial of abdominal X-ray is recommended following up on the progress of the foreign body. When the foreign body remains in the right lower quadrant in serial abdominal X-ray, an appendicular foreign body should be highly suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Although FBs in the appendix are rare, different kinds of foreign bodies have been reported to be trapped in the appendix, and most of them are found to be radiopaque.\n\n【21】An appendicular foreign body can be classified into high-risk and low-risk depending on the ingested object. High-risk FBs are found in 75% of the cases and include sharp, long or pointed, while low-risk are found in 12% of the cases and include blunt, round objects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>.

She came with episodes of colicky abdominal pain without any clinical or laboratory signs of FMF attack. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound appeared linear metallic foreign body trapped in the appendix. The determination of surgical intervention was based on ultrasound, which revealed the foreign body in the lumen of the appendix regardless of physical examination to avoid complications in the upcoming future, and a prophylactic appendectomy was done.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer and doctors in pediatric and pediatric surgery departments for the consent for publication and the laboratory assistants in Tishreen Hospital Laboratory.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report did not require review by the ethics committee of Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WRITTEN INFORMED\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Early detection of such lesions can prevent complications by linking patients to care early. We report a case of a 45-year-old Chinese men who has sex with men (MSM) presenting with a wound on his penis after masturbation. Initial impressions of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation led to a circumcision and frenulectomy. Routine histology done provided an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates suggestive of Syphilis. Serology was done to confirm the diagnosis and patient was treated with oral doxycycline for 2 weeks. This case aims to highlight the importance of routine histology during circumcisions especially because lesions such as syphilitic chancres are not always typical in presentation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Syphilis is an infection caused by the _Treponema pallidum_ spirochete and has a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. A syphilitic infection is classically thought to evolve through 4 basic stages—Primary, Secondary, Latent and Tertiary with additional qualifiers of Early and Late depending on the duration of the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While this system provides a framework for understanding the natural history of a syphilitic infection, the key challenge in diagnosing based on such a system is that clinical signs can be subtle and are often mistaken as other less sinister ailments. The traditional teaching of a painless ulcer with a clean base for example tends to be an exception than the rule with many primary syphilitic lesions having many different and atypical presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This is the main reason that it is known as the ‘Great Mimicker’ and has gone undetected despite advances in screening methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, because many of the signs in a Primary and Secondary Syphilis resolve spontaneously, patients seldom attend follow-up clinic sessions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Underpinning the importance of early detection of Syphilis is that left untreated, Syphilis progresses into 3 major life-threatening syndromes—Late Neurosyphilis. Cardiovascular Syphilis and Late Benign gummas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Certain populations such as the MSM are known to have a higher prevalence of Syphilis compared with the heterosexual population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Circumcision is the process of partially or completely removing the foreskin and is one of the most common surgical procedures for men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Indications for circumcision include religious/cultural purposes, phimosis, balanoposthitis and risk reduction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There is much debate about the utility of routine histology of the excised prepuce in circumcisions for medical indications and the extent to which such an investigation changes the overall management.\n\n【5】We report the clinical findings of a patient presenting with wound at the frenulum of the penis noticed immediately after masturbation, which was more in keeping with a traumatic wound, based on the patients’ history, that was eventually confirmed to be a Primary Syphilis infection.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 45-year-old Chinese man presented to the clinic with a wound at the ventral surface of the penis. Patient reported that he noticed the wound after he masturbated a few days ago. He reported that he felt a sudden pain as he was masturbating and noticed a wound around the frenulum. Patient also complained of pain around the wound especially during erections.\n\n【8】Patient has an allergy to Penicillin but no previous medical history or family history of autoimmune diseases. No history of tobacco smoking or alcohol use. Patient is a Men who has Sex with Men (MSM) and engages in predominantly penetrative anal sex. Patient reports that sexual intercourse is usually protected and has 3–5 sexual partners that year. Partners are usually casual, and patient does not know the HIV or Syphilis status of any of his partners. His last Syphilis and HIV test was done 6 months ago and was non-Reactive. Last sexual intercourse was 3 months ago.\n\n【9】Physical examination found a partial thickness tear at the ventral aspect of the penis, midline and extending 5 mm along the longitudinal aspect of the frenulum. Wound was shallow with regular borders. Base of the lesion was yellow with minimal discharge and no surrounding erythema. No inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other lesions were seen in the groin.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|(A) Initial presentation of ulcer; (B) histology of resected foreskin demonstrating presence of plasma cells.</u>\n\n【11】Initial impression was that of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation. Patient was offered a frenulectomy to remove the remaining frenulum. Patient opted for a circumcision at the same time as he already had an elective circumcision planned for a few months’ time.\n\n【12】Circumcision was done on the same day of the visit under local anaesthesia. A dorsal slit method was used to remove the foreskin; the remnant frenulum tissue was removed in the same incision. The circumferential wound was closed with 3–0 Vicryl, while the wound at the frenulum was left to heal by secondary intention. Excised tissue including the foreskin and the remnant tissue surrounding the frenulum was sent for histology.\n\n【13】Histology found that the tissue from the remnant tissue of the frenulum to be extensively ulcerated. The ulcer contained a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells with polymorphs towards the surface and a dense underlying mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate including a large number of plasma cells strongly suggestive of a Syphilitic infection.\n\n【14】Syphilis tests were done according to current laboratory protocols. Syphilis serology yielded a Positive Treponemal Test (Syphilis Treponemal Antibody) and Positive for both Non-Treponemal Tests—Rapid Plasmin Reagin (RPR) Titre 1:2 and _T. Pallidum_ Particle Agglutination (TPPA).\n\n【15】Given the previous negative Syphilis blood test 6 months ago, a new positive Treponemal and Non-Treponemal blood test result and a wound with plasma cell infiltrates seen on histology, the diagnosis of primary syphilis was made.\n\n【16】Patient was commenced on 2 weeks of doxycycline due to his allergy to penicillin. The patient’s wound healing was uneventful with no secondary infections and completely healed at the end of 2 weeks. A repeat blood test was done 1 month after which demonstrated a decrease in the titre levels of the RPR tests. Follow-up bloods after 6 months demonstrated a Non-Reactive RPR with the Treponemal Antibody and TPPA remaining reactive. The diagnosis was that of Primary Syphilis status post-completed treatment with serological scarring.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】We present a case of a man who presented with a wound along the frenulum that occurred after masturbation. Originally thought to be a mechanical frenulum tear from overzealous masturbation, patient elected for a circumcision with a frenulectomy. Routine histology revealed an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates. The patient’s sexual orientation of an MSM, placed him at a higher risk of contracting Syphilis, prompting further testing in the form of Syphilis serology that eventually led to the conclusion that the initial frenulum tear was in fact a primary syphilitic chancre. We hope that this case would highlight the importance of routine histology in circumcision in guiding the diagnostic process.\n\n【19】Currently, there is an ongoing debate on the utility of routine histology for circumcision. Previous studies have compared using clinical signs or histology to diagnose dermatological lesions on the foreskin in patients undergoing circumcision but have yet to come to a consensus on which modality is superior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Most recently, Kerr _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> report that clinical diagnosis of lesions in the prepuce correspond to histological diagnosis in up to 80% of cases. Coupled with the lack of evidence associating dermatological lesions of the foreskin with the development of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, these authors are of the opinion that routine histology testing is not required and that clinicians can reliably achieve a diagnosis solely with a physical examination of the area. Additional findings in the study also suggest significant costs saving with the same patient outcome when foregoing a histological investigation.\n\n【21】In a response to these claims, Bunker _et al._ raises an important perspective that a diagnosis need not purely be a clinical or histological diagnosis but a combination of the two. The authors highlighted important shortcomings of the initial study by Kerr _et al._ such as the lack of a uniform control group when making the comparisons between the accuracy of a clinical and histological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Indeed, it is further reported by Bunker _et al._ that their centre’s experience up to 45% of the diagnosis of Penile intraepithelial neoplasia was achieved only with a histology with only 8% of the clinicians being confident of the diagnosis without histological confirmation.\n\n【22】From the standpoint of using histology as part of the diagnostic work up instead of solely relying on clinical examination, we agree with that routine histology should be done for circumcision. Syphilis is a prime example of the need for clinical assessment and laboratory investigations to complement each other to provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【23】Syphilis is a disease caused by the _T. Pallidum_ bacteria and is known as the Great Mimicker as early symptoms can be vague and misdiagnosis based on clinical signs is very common. Primary syphilis is the earliest phase of the infection and is defined by the presence of a painless chancre which usually resolves spontaneously. The situation is similar in secondary Syphilis where a prominent but painless rash erupts and disappears without any intervention. The transient and seemingly indolent nature of the physical manifestations of the initial stages of a Syphilis infection mean that the diagnosis cannot be achieved solely on a physical examination but also requires laboratory investigations. Wound swabs for general bacterial cultures are unable to detect syphilis because the treponemal bacterium does not grow well in regular culture mediums. Although is possible to detect the presence of _T. Pallium_ in wounds with dark field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing or polymerase chain reaction, these investigations tend to be labour intensive and not commonly done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Histology of tissue can identify plasma cell infiltrates which is a result of the inflammatory response elicited by the infection and is common in a Primary Syphilitic infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In the current case, the lesion that the patient presented with was painful and its appearance coincided with a traumatic event (masturbation). The differential diagnoses considered when approaching this case included, trauma, herpes and Syphilis. Although Syphilis was one of the differentials in this case, the lesion reportedly manifested shortly after a traumatic incident of overzealous masturbation and the presence of pain (Syphilitic chancres classically described as being painless) directed us towards considering the wound more traumatic in nature. While there is evidence to suggest that certain at-risk populations such as the MSM group have a higher prevalence of Syphilis, this patient’s sexual orientation was of secondary consideration, and we would like to highlight the process of achieving the diagnosis which was made possible because of routine histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Without the additional information about the presence of plasma cell infiltrates in the excised tissue provided by routine histology, the diagnosis of Syphilis would have otherwise gone untreated. The early diagnosis and prompt treatment of primary Syphilis in this patient allowed for an early intervention in reducing his risk of developing a more severe form of the disease. This would not have been possible without a combined diagnostic approach of using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation.\n\n【25】Presentations of Syphilis are seldom straightforward; however, the consequences of a missed diagnosis and delay in treatment can allow the disease to progress to Tertiary Syphilis which can be life threatening. We hope that in reviewing this case, we can call to mind the fact that Syphilis chancres are never typical in presentation and the importance of routinely incorporating investigations such as histology in circumcisions to complement clinical assessment.\n\n【26】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------\n\n【27】All authors contributed equally to the writing and preparation of the manuscript.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The Authors have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this Case Report.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL DECLARATION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval and consent has been approved by our center’s (Dr Tan Medical Center—Singapore) internal review board.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent for publication has been obtained by the patient discussed in this Care Report.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials—no data set used in this Case Report.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Of these 17 pregnancies, eight pregnancies showed complete response, six showed partial response and three showed no response. No adverse events or thromboembolic events were reported in these pregnancies, thus TPO-RAs have been started to be used in pregnant women worldwide. However, the data are limited due to the retrospective nature of the study, and data from East Asian population is lacking.\n\n【5】We here report a case of pregnancy complicated with refractory ITP and chronic hypertension (CH) managed with Eltrombopag, which resulted in superimposed preeclampsia (SPE) requiring subsequent termination at 27 weeks of gestation. Although she was managed without blood transfusion or comorbidity during peripartum period, we had difficulty in controlling platelet count only with Eltrombopag during the peripartum period.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-years-old nulliparous Japanese woman was diagnosed with ITP at age 16; who showed poor response to corticosteroids, splenectomy and rituximab, was referred to the obstetrics department for prenatal counseling. Due to the low platelet count which fluctuated around 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, pregnancy was not recommended since severe maternal hemorrhage was highly anticipated. However, she soon conceived naturally, and chose induced abortion at 11 weeks of gestation. At age 32, she again conceived naturally with platelet count of 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, but she was determined to continue her pregnancy despite of previously discussed risks. After consultation with hematologists, 10 mg of prednisolone was started at 8 weeks of gestation, but her platelet count showed no increase from 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was initiated at 10 weeks of gestation to confirm its effect, and it gradually increased from day 2, and reached the peak of 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 7, but decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 14. Although corticosteroids were ineffective, IVIg therapy showed temporal effect and it was repeated twice in 13th and 16th week of gestation as her platelet count again decreased to 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Since her platelet count showed no increase with steroids, and required repetitive administration of IVIg, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18 weeks of gestation with discontinuance of prednisolone. Platelets increased to 160 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in 14 days, but white blood cell count (WBC) also increased to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23 + 0 weeks of gestation. Consequently, her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus the dosage was increased to 25 mg again at 26 + 0 weeks of gestation .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The patient was administered corticosteroids and three times of immunoglobulin therapy in the first and second trimester. Eltrombopag 25mg/day was initiated from 18th week of gestation with discontinuance of corticosteroids. Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5mg/day from 23rd week of gestation, but it resulted in the decrease in platelets, thus it was increased again to 25mg/day at 26th week of gestation. Immunoglobulin therapy was combined to Eltrombopag after admission due to SPE, which resulted in rapid increase in the platelet count. PLT: platelet count, PSL: corticosteroid.</u>\n\n【9】Upon her maternal checkup at 12 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 147/96 and she was diagnosed as CH and was given 750 mg/day of oral methyldopa, but we refrained from starting low dose aspirin due to its antiplatelet effect. We increased methyldopa to 1500 mg at 25 + 4 weeks of gestation since her blood pressure increased to 145/95 mmHg. However, hypertension deteriorated to 200/110 mmHg and she complained of headache at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with SPE with urine protein of 1010 mg/day and was hospitalized. Intravenous nicardipine was initiated with 2 mg/h and magnesium sulfate with 1 g/h, and her blood pressure was controlled below 140/90 mmHg, and her headache resolved. Two betamethasone injections of 12 mg were given 24 h apart to prepare for delivery. Platelet count was still 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation and IVIg was started to prepare for the deterioration of SPE which may require prompt termination. At 27 + 3 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 169/100 even after administration of nicardipine 3 mg/h, and she also showed pulmonary edema with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 90% and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 57.7 mmHg . Therefore, caesarian section was decided due to maternal pulmonary edema from SPE and her platelet count was 130 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> / μl before the surgery. The surgery took 1 h and 9 min with blood loss of 1400 ml. A female neonate weighed 714 g with Apgar score of 4/8 (1 min and 5 min, respectively) and her platelet count was 68 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at birth. As the neonate’s platelet count dropped to 33 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl within 8 h, IVIg (400 mg/kg/day) was initiated and the platelets were maintained over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The patient developed pulmonary edema due to SPE. The chest X-ray shows butterfly pulmonary opacities with dull cardiopulmonary angles.</u>\n\n【11】After surgery, her platelet count was consistently over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl and she was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks after delivery. Upon her visit at 6 weeks after delivery, she was still on 12.5 mg/day of Eltrombopag with platelet count of 23 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. The platelet count of the infant was constantly over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl with no transfusion or medication and was discharged 144 days after birth without any comorbidity.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】ITP can occur during any trimester, and preexisting ITP can deteriorate during pregnancy. There is no concrete consensus on the management of ITP during pregnancy, but it is generally recommended to maintain the platelet count over 30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In the present case, her platelet count was 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in the first trimester. We confirmed that she was responsive to IVIg in the first trimester, but since she was not responsive to steroids, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18th week of gestation. However, the dosage was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23rd week of gestation due to the unusual increase in WBC, which again required increase to 25 mg/day at 26th week of gestation, since her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Adequate control of her platelet count could not be achieved only with Eltrombopag, thus we added IVIg therapy to control her platelet count after the onset of SPE.\n\n【14】When treatment is indicated against ITP, corticosteroid is chosen as an initial therapy and IVIg therapy is generally chosen to raise the platelet count in preparation for delivery in patients refractory to steroids. On the other hand, other treatment options chosen in non-pregnant patients are not recommended during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. However, recent studies suggest the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs during pregnancy and has shed light on the poor responders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. According to the United States Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), the initial dose is 50 mg/day, but East Asians are recommended to reduce the initial dose to 25 mg/day, since plasma Eltrombopag concentration was 50–55% higher in East Asian population as compared to non-East Asians, thus our initial dosage was 25 mg/day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In fact, the present case required reduction from 25 mg/day to 12.5 mg/day due to the unusual increase in WBC to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. As some studies have reported that TPO-RAs may increase the risk of myeloid fibrosis, we decreased the dosage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Although there has been no report of leukocytosis in previous pregnant ITP cases, not only platelets but also WBC should be carefully monitored during Eltrombopag use especially in East Asian population.\n\n【15】Eltrombopag had been assigned to ‘category C’ by the FDA in pregnancy, since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Eltrombopag use in pregnancy. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, there was evidence of embryo lethality and reduced fetal weights at maternally toxic doses. Thus, Eltrombopag should be used only when benefit outweighs its risk during pregnancy after thorough discussion with the patient. In our case, due to the uncertainty of the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy, we did not recommend its use during pregnancy especially in the first trimester, but since she wished to continue her pregnancy, it was started from the second trimester after thorough discussion with the patient.\n\n【16】Preconception counseling is the pivotal first step in the management of ITP patients who wish to conceive. Considering the high prevalence of SPE in CH patients of up to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and possible deterioration of thrombocytopenia with SPE, patients with CH and ITP require thorough preconception counseling to share the obstetrical risks with the health care provider. As for prenatal management, in patients refractory to corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to use Eltrombopag to increase platelet count starting from the second trimester after thorough counseling. This case failed in acquiring adequate control of the platelet count only with Eltrombopag, and severe leukocytosis and early onset of SPE occurred, although the relation between SPE and Eltrombopag is unclear. Informing the possibility of these previously unknown risks of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy to the patient prior to conception may be necessary in patients with ITP and CH who require Eltrombopag use, especially in East Asian population.\n\n【17】This is the first case report of an East Asian woman with ITP and CH who used Eltrombopag to maintain her platelet count during pregnancy. She developed SPE at 27 weeks of gestation requiring prompt termination of pregnancy, and she required IVIg along with Eltrombopag to raise her platelet count for caesarian section. Controlling platelet count with Eltrombopag seems reasonable when other options are unavailable during pregnancy, but its dosage should be controlled with monitoring of WBC as well, especially in East Asian population. Well-controlled study to validate the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy is waited.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The design of this work has been approved by the University of Tokyo ethical committee.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Seisuke Sayama.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Its symptoms usually do not appear until adulthood. We report a patient who was admitted with recurrent pneumothorax. Discovering typical cutaneous lesions accompanied with a history of the same condition in his son, BHD syndrome was diagnosed.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease that is manifested by benign cutaneous tumors (fibrofolliculoma and trichodiscoma), recurrent pneumothorax, multiple lung cysts and renal cancer. This syndrome, which was first described in 1977, is caused by a mutation in the folliculin gene (FLCN) located on chromosome 17 通用删除11(英):<u>(p11.2)</u>, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein folliculin. Dysfunction of the folliculin protein leads to the abnormalities seen in BHD syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】The patient was a nonsmoker 70-year-old man who presented with pain in the right side of his chest, shortness of breath and tachypnea that started suddenly after he lifted a heavy object. The patient also reported an occasional dry cough. He mentioned the history of similar symptoms and associated pneumothorax twice, once in the same year and once 6 years before. Both of the episodes also occurred in the right lung, causing him to be hospitalized with a chest tube. Vital signs on arrival were oxygen saturation of 90%, blood pressure of 130/80, respiratory rate of 23 per minute and pulse rate of 98 beats per min. Several 1–2 mm soft and whitish lesions were found at the site of hair growth in the form of dome-shaped papules, the same color as the skin. Furthermore, small lesions and peduncles were observed on the right shoulder, neck and upper chest .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Patient’s skin lesions. (A) fibrofolliculoma and trichodiscom (yellow arrow) (B) Acrochordon .</u>\n\n【7】Chest wall examination showed hyper-resonance and reduced breath sound in the right lung, and asymmetric chest expansion. A family history of multiple pneumothorax incidents were reported in his 30-year-old son. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive pneumothorax in the right side of the chest and multiple parenchymal cysts. Moreover, sub-pleural fibrotic bands were detected at the lower lobes of both lungs . There were no abnormal findings in the renal, liver and hematology laboratory tests. A chest tube was placed in the right side of pleural space, and the patient’s symptoms improved afterward. Renal ultrasonography was performed, and the result was unremarkable. His chest tube was removed after 3 days, and he was discharged with a good general condition.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Patients chest CT scan: (A) right side pneumothorax. (B, C) multiple parenchymal cysts (blue arrow) and, sub-pleural fibrosis at the inferior lobes of both lungs (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Spontaneous pneumothorax may be primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without an external predisposing factor and/or pulmonary disease However, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax happens due to serious underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic diseases of the lung such as BHD syndromes and Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) and other diseases such as thoracic endometriosis. BHD is caused by a mutation in the FCLN gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein folliculin. Abnormal folliculin protein accounts for the manifestations of BHD. The incidence of BHD syndrome is unknown worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The main and most common cutaneous lesion of BHD syndrome is a benign hair follicle hamartoma called fibrofolliculoma. These lesions usually occur as numerous small whitish lesions on the face and neck of patients. Another cutaneous lesion is called trichodiscoma, which is similar in appearance. Another cutaneous lesion is Acrochordon—a small and pedunculated lesion with a dermal and epidermal origin. Acrochordon usually appears on the eyelid, neck, upper chest and armpits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition to cutaneous lesions, patients with BHD syndrome have bilateral, multiple, small and irregular-shaped cysts in the peripheral lung parenchyma. Unlike bullae in emphysema, which are usually found in the apices of the lungs, BHD cysts are more common in the bases. These cysts’ walls are covered with a layer of the alveolar epithelium, which is unique and puts patients at increased risk for recurrent pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】These cysts grow gradually and are hamartomatous, and in all cases, the cyst wall staining is positive for FLCN. The most worrying feature of BHD syndrome is its association with renal lesions, especially renal cancers. The prevalence of renal tumors in people with this syndrome is seven times higher. The most common renal cancer histopathologies are chromophobe and chromophobe-oncocytic, but papillary and clear cell types are also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. LAM is most often seen in young women with small thin-walled cysts that spread throughout the parenchyma of both lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare nodular and cystic disease of the lung interstitium that primarily affects young adult smokers. It is caused by aggregations of abnormal dendritic cells. Chest CT scan shows thickening of the interstitial tissue, as well as multiple cysts and nodules, usually in the upper lobes, sometimes leading to pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Another disease with similar lung involvement to BHD is pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, a life-threatening disease, which is observed in individuals with immunodeficiency. These patients are often referred to the hospital due to pulmonary insufficiency, fever and dry cough. Chest radiography of these patients shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrations, single or multiple nodules and sometimes pneumatocele and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs in patients with COPD. Bullae formation is associated with non-fibrotic degradation of the airways, and usually affects the upper lobes more than the lower lobes. These patients often have a history of smoking and coughing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our case was a 70-year-old man who was referred to the hospital with recurrent pneumothorax. Male sex, absence of immunodeficiency and smoking history, his imaging and cutaneous findings, as well as a family history of pneumothorax in his son are all highly suggestive of BHD disease. Considering the rarity, diagnosis of the disease and its complications is often delayed. Therefore, after diagnosis, annual medical follow-up with laboratory tests and imaging is recommended. For those patients with recurrent pneumothorax wedge resection or pleurodesis are beneficial. Moreover, the genetic evaluation of other family members is necessary for early diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case, BHD diagnosis was made due to recurrent pneumothorax, cutaneous lesions and imaging findings. Early diagnosis of these patients is valuable to alert providers to the need for annual renal cancer screening and to suggest possible treatment options. Determination of pneumothorax etiology is important in order to treat the patients appropriately.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This article was prepared without any support or funding.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ardabil University of Medical Science.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Mohammad Negaresh.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It affects mainly adults between 60 and 70 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Histopathologically, the tumor combines the criteria of two distinct benign tumors: hamartoma, which is mixt of different tissues composing a normal bronchus, and chondroma, which is a tumor of cartilaginous cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the largest series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, the sex ratio was 6.1 (37 men, 6 women) and 86% of patients were symptomatic with recurrent respiratory infections, central airway obstruction (mimicking COPD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and hemoptysis (30%). Bronchoscopy generally provides the diagnosis thanks to biopsies but is also, in case of endoluminal presentation, the only treatment. If endoscopic resection is not complete, surgery can be proposed with the aim to be as conservative as possible. Local recurrence is generally low. In the series of 43 patients published by Casío _et al._ , a recurrence occurred in four patients. This should deserve an endoscopic follow-up even though malignant transformation has not yet been described for this type of tumor unlike pure chondroma, which has the potential to evolve to chondrosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【5】With this clinical case, we aimed to show that debulking of endotracheal hamartochondroma, using interventional bronchoscopic techniques, is feasible, effective and safe, and to demonstrate the diagnostic challenge of rare tracheal hamartochondroma masquerading as COPD.\n\n【6】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【7】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The patient was presumed to be adherent on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and was initiated on respective treatments for the opportunistic infections but continued to deteriorate. On further reviewing, he was found to be poorly adherent to ART and was advised enhanced adherence counselling after which his condition improved. We report this case to emphasize the importance of adherence to ART medications in the management of patients with HIV.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have high morbidity and mortality owing to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Early diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of management in patients with advanced HIV. Although a lot of stress is laid on the initiation of therapy, monitoring of compliance and importance of adherence in management is often neglected. We present a case of advanced HIV with multiple opportunistic infections to emphasize that adherence to ART is the most effective tool in managing patients with advanced HIV, and poor treatment adherence is associated with adverse outcomes.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old gentleman who worked in the para-military forces presented to a secondary care hospital with intermittent high-grade fever associated with loss of appetite and weight (around 10 kg) for a year. He was found to be positive for HIV-1 infection and was advised ART. He did not initiate ART and presented 2 months later to us with fever, shortness of breath and loose stools for 15 days. He was found to have a CD4 count of 62/mcl. A chest X-ray and computed tomography of the chest was done for these complaints, which was suggestive of _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia. He was managed in the intensive care unit with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and steroids. After 2 days of initiation of treatment, he developed erythema over forearm, neck, chest and extremities. This was accompanied by oral mucosal involvement and punctate keratopathy. He was diagnosed as Steven Johnson syndrome-toxic epidemo-necrolysis overlap secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was immediately stopped, and he was put on steroids. His lesions resolved in next 2 weeks and he was started on tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz along with dapsone prophylaxis. ART was not started earlier as both tenofovir and efavirenz could have worsened the skin condition. He was discharged in a stable condition. He reported proper compliance in all his out-patient visits. Eighteen months into the illness, he started to have dysphagia and small bowel type of diarrhoea (15–20 times/day, non-bloody, not associated with abdominal pain and tenesmus) for which he was admitted. On upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, he was found to have oesophagal candidiasis and was started on fluconazole. Stool microscopy revealed _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts, and he was initiated on nitazoxanide. However, he continued to have diarrhoea with multiple stool samples detecting _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts and had persistent dyselectrolytemia for which oral supplementation was given. He continued to deteriorate and was found to have features of dehydration, severe wasting, candidiasis (oral) and diffuse ichthyosis on examination. Dosage of nitazoxanide was increased, and azithromycin was added once daily for cryptosporidiosis to which he responded partially.\n\n【6】His CD4 count was zero, and viral load was high. His previous CD4 counts done at six-monthly intervals after the baseline count of CD4 of 62/mcl were 104/mcl and 76/mcl. With suspicion of failure, he was started on zidovudine, lamivudine and atazanavir/ritonavir. Single-tablet regimen with a protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitor was not available under the national scheme for use in this patient. HIV resistance genotyping did not detect any resistance to any of the tested drugs. On reviewing the history, he reported decreased adherence to the ART medications as he avoided taking his medications in front of his co-workers on outstation postings. He also seemed to be extremely worried about his ill health. He was counselled about the severity of his condition and the importance of adherence. He was referred to a trained psychologist for evaluation. He was found to be depressed and was started on anti-depressant by the psychiatrist. He was continued on a PI-based therapy, owing to its higher barrier to resistance, considering his history of non-compliance.\n\n【7】He continued to have persistent diarrhoea along with dysphagia not responding to fluconazole. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis was suspected in addition to candidiasis based on raised CMV viral load and UGI endoscopy findings. He was started on valganciclovir after which his CMV viral load became negative. His diarrhoea and dysphagia eventually improved and was discharged on PI-based ART, dapsone prophylaxis and fluconazole. He was also registered for regular follow-up with the psychologist and psychiatrist.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Cryptosporidiosis is commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV with an overall prevalence of 8.7%. These patients present with a diarrheal illness which may last for months resulting in weight loss, malnutrition and extended hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although nitazoxanide is approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, it is often ineffective. Other agents like azithromycin and PIs have been tried with minimal success. Effective ART is probably the most effective tool in managing patients with cryptosporidiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】CMV infection is associated with rapid HIV disease progression and consequently, more acquired immune deficiency syndrome related events. ART is not only effective in controlling HIV replication but also decreases CMV-related adverse events by the restoration of CMV-specific immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. CMV-related gastrointestinal disease is seen in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression. Oesophagus and colon are the most important sites that are affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ganciclovir/valganciclovir, along with the initiation of effective ART, is the treatment of choice.\n\n【11】India has a total of >2 million HIV-positive individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most of these patients are managed in ART centres linked to the national programme. The national programme was initiated in 1992, and it has been giving free ART to all HIV registered HIV patients since 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The programme continues to give free ART to all the registered patients despite the decrease in its funding. The national programme has tried to keep up with the recommendations on the treatment given by the World Health Organisation. Since 2013, the first-line treatment has been a single-tablet regimen of tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For those who fail the first-line treatment, they are shifted to a two-pill regimen containing atazanavir/ritonavir. While the programme works fairly well for most patients, in this patient, there were certain challenges. At the time, the patient presented routine viral load monitoring was not available for all patients at the centre. It was done only for those patients where immunological failure was suspected. Despite access to free ART, the number of centres that dispense medications is limited, leading to high patient turn over in each centre. Due to the high patient turn, the time spent with each patient is suboptimal, leading to a poor patient–physician relationship. Also, adherence is measured by pill counting method and therefore, it is easy to miss non-compliance. Single-tablet regimen with dolutegravir has been recently introduced in the national scheme, but it was not available at the time, the patient was being managed.\n\n【12】Variable drug adherence was noted (47–90%) in the studies from Indian centres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The problem of drug adherence is further compounded by high pill burden, poor health literacy and treatment-related side effects in patients with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART is associated with inadequate viral suppression, increased resistance and increased opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. It is essential to spend time with the patient and understand his/her problems during the initiation of ART. Patients are often scared of revealing their medical condition to their employers for fear of being judged and losing their job. It is also essential to empowering the patient about their rights 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART, due to various socio-economic factors, is often missed by healthcare staffs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It is imperative to consider the social aspects like living conditions, economic support, working conditions and family support.\n\n【13】Potential solutions to improve adherence include better education and motivation of patients, early referral for diagnosis and treatment, home visits, an increase in human resources and, creating social support groups. Patient education programmes are essential not only in the hospital but also in the communities near patients’ residence. This would help to dispel the misconceptions and stigma associated with HIV infection. Adherence counselling, although a time-consuming process is an advantageous intervention in terms of overall patient outcome.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nil.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was taken prior to publications.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor—same as the corresponding author.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Here, we report a case of a 64-year-old male who was hospitalized because of recurrent effort-related syncope events. Physical examination revealed several characteristic clinical clues for subclavian steal syndrome. Indeed, through the use of multimodality imaging, the diagnosis was established. We demonstrate that the combination of history taking, thorough physical exam and subsequent imaging studies can establish a relatively rare diagnosis of recurrent syncope.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】When the proximal section of the subclavian artery becomes stenotic, blood supply to the ipsilateral arm may become impaired. Rarely, in the face of growing flow demand, blood flow through the posterior circulation may reverse as a compensatory mechanism, resulting in diminished cerebral blood flow, which may be manifested as episodes vertigo and/or syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Commonly, atherosclerosis is the primary condition that begins this cascade of events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 64-year-old male suffered from recurrent episodes of dizziness and three syncope events. All three episodes were preceded by physical effort which involved the upper extremities. No chest pain, palpitations or cough spells prior to the occurrence of syncope were reported. His past medical history included diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and active cigarette smoking, without a previous history ischemic heart disease, arrythmias, previous peripheral vascular interventions nor a diagnosis of chronic lung disease. Due to his complaints, he was initially seen by his family medical doctor, where low blood pressures were recorded (90/60 mm Hg). Following a third episode of syncope he was referred to the hospital and subsequently admitted to the department of cardiovascular medicine for further workup. Upon examination, a significant difference in blood pressures was noted between the upper limbs (130/70 mm Hg on the right brachial artery, 90/70 on the left brachial artery). Other vital signs were normal: heart rate of 72 bpm and O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 98% in room air. A bruit was noted on auscultation over the left subclavian artery. No differences in pulse amplitude, strength, skin color or arm circumference were noted upon examination of the upper limbs, and carotid sinus massage and test for orthostatic hypotension were both negative. Provocative arm maneuvers resulted in dizziness, but not syncope. Electrocardiographic recording demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal PR interval, without ischemic changes in the ST-T segments; lab exams at admission demonstrated Troponin-T measurements of 15.5 and 13.4 ng/L, hemoglobin and glucose measurements were within normal range.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography scan, sagittal plane.

Indeed, CTA scan demonstrated an obstruction and retrograde filling of the right common carotid artery and obstruction of the right brachiocephalic trunk . To prove whether stealing of blood flow is the trigger for the recurrent syncope events, a Doppler ultrasound was done, revealing blood flow reversal in the right external carotid artery , a blunted _‘Parvus et tardus’_ blood flow in the right common carotid artery , and a ‘pre-steal’ component in the right vertebral artery .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Doppler ultrasound of the right common carotid artery.

As of yet, no further hospitalizations were reported.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition in which significant stenosis and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery results in a compromise of distal perfusion to the vertebral artery. As the stenosis progresses, a pressure gradient between the two vertebral arteries gradually emerges, favoring a reversed blood flow in the vertebral artery distal and ipsilateral to the diseased subclavian artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This condition is relatively rare, affecting ~2–4% of the general population, although prevalence is higher among those with concomitant established cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Treatment options for subclavian steal syndrome are diverse and mainly include angioplasty and stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> as well as bypass implantations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Indeed, Bates _et al._ reported a 76% 5-year survival in a large case series of patients who underwent subclavian artery stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In summary, our report demonstrates that subclavian artery stenosis is a rare cause for syncope that should be suspected if relevant clues emerge during meticulous history taking and physical examination of pulses and blood pressures.

There was a drop in acute coronary syndrome admission rates worldwide as collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were reluctant to seek appropriate care. We presented a 47-year-old woman with acute heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. She had a history of typical prolonged chest pain 2 weeks before but no coronary risk factors. The electrocardiogram was consistent with late presentation myocardial infarction. Focused echocardiography showed severe left ventricle systolic dysfunction. She was medically treated for both pneumonia and heart failure. Coronary angiography showed no flow-limiting lesion.

Although the lungs are the primary organ affected by COVID-19, several reports have shown that the cardiovascular system can be involved in the setting of this disease through various mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement, the pandemic has also impacted general cardiovascular care through reduced availability of healthcare services for non-COVID-19 work and reluctance of patients to seek prompt medical attention for fear of infection. Indeed, a substantial reduction in patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes has been noted during the pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of a neglected myocardial infarction in a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the hospital with heart failure and concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\nA 47-year old lady presented acutely with a 2-week history of worsening dyspnea. The patient had no previous cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing conditions. She had obtained a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as part of her insurance company’s workup 6 months prior, which was normal. She described prolonged chest pain at rest 2 weeks before admission. The chest pain was retrosternal radiating to the jaw and the left arm, worsened with physical effort and was accompanied by perspiration. The patient avoided seeking hospital treatment for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In the physical exam, she had bilateral coarse crackles in both lungs. ECG on admission showed Q wave and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3 and inverted T wave in leads aVL and V2–V4 . Lung Computed tomography (CT) on admission showed bilateral consolidation and ground-glass appearance with bilateral pleural effusion . The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Blood work demonstrated leucocytosis 19 |$\\\\times$| 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> , lymphopenia 965/mm <sup>3 </sup> and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) 16.7 mg/dl (normal < 1 mg/dl) and procalcitonin 0.08 ng/ml (normal: 0.05 ng/ml), N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly elevated at 21517 pg/ml according to recommended cut-off values > 450 pg/mL in patients less than 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. troponin I was not raised (<0.2 ng/ml). Focused echocardiography in the intensive care unit revealed severely reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic (C-ANCA, P-ANCA), lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. She received medical therapy with the diagnosis of acute heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia, including metoprolol, lisinopril and aspirin, clopidogrel. Coronary angiography showed no flow-limiting epicardial coronary artery disease . During the 3 weeks following her discharge, she experienced fatigue and exertional dyspnea in her ordinary physical activity, New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) II. Her dyspnea improved after that, and she has been reclassified to NYHA classification I. Since the coronary arteries were normal, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was scheduled to rule out any possible non-ischemic cause of myocardial injury, such as myocarditis or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The CMR was performed 3-month post-recovery and revealed enlarged LV volume (end-diastole 120 cc/m <sup>2 </sup> ), severely reduced ejection fraction of 30% and akinesia in the anterior and mid to apical septal wall. There was also subendocardial near transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) consistent with near transmural infarction in the left anterior descending territory (LAD) .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) ECG showed Q wave and ST-segment elevation V1-V3 and inverted T in leads aVL and V2-V4.

( **D** and **E** ) CMR LGE sequences showed near transmural infarction in the LAD territory.</u>\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】Our patient was admitted with acute heart failure and signs of neglected myocardial infarction based on the characteristics of her previous chest pain episodes and the ECG findings. The CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacity with bilateral consolidation as well as bilateral pleural effusion, which can be seen in both acute pulmonary oedema and COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pattern of lung involvement presented in our patient are also among the CT features mostly reported during 12–17 days of COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, so we assume the onset of COVID-19 must have preceded with the onset of chest pain. According to lung CT imaging features, it was difficult to distinguish the proportion of viral lung damage from acute pulmonary edema since both can appear as extensive ground-glass appearance and thickened interlobular septa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The laboratory data, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated CRP and procalcitonin are all consistent with the COVID-19 inflammatory phase. Troponin was negative as expected, as we assume it must have returned to baseline because the acute phase of chest pain occurred 2 weeks earlier. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly elevated in line with acute pulmonary edema. We believe the lung has been affected by both acute pulmonary edema and viral pneumonia regarding available laboratory and imaging tests. The coronary arteries were without any atherosclerotic lesion in angiography. Although CMR was not performed during the acute phase of our patient’s disease, the presence of extensive subendocardial scar in the myocardium ruled out any non-ischemic cause of myocardial injury, such as a previous episode of myocarditis, which typically manifested with subepicardial and/or midwall fibrosis, or other pathologies such as non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Takotsubo was also ruled out as a possible cause of myocardial injury, as no significant infarction or fibrosis is apparent on CMR in this condition, and ventricular function typically recovers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, based on the clinical scenario, lung and cardiac imaging, and laboratory findings, we decided that the patient’s ultimate diagnosis is myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries, which can be classified as myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary artery (MINOCA).\n\n【9】Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 may act through multiple disease mechanisms, including non-ischemic myocardial injuries such as myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and ischemic myocardial damage, all can be seen in the acute and recovery phase of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. Patients who present with evidence of myocardial infarction without signs of obstructive coronary artery disease are categorized as MINOCA. Plaque disruption, coronary artery spasm, thromboembolism, coronary dissection, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other forms of type 2 myocardial infarction are the most common causes. CMR is the reference standard non-invasive modality for myocardial tissue characterization and can differentiate myocardial injury’s ischemic and non-ischemic patterns. CMR’s ability to detect and localize fibrosis caused by prior myocarditis or other non-ischemic cardiomyopathies aids in determining the etiology of myocardial injury and distinguishing the phenotypes of cardiomyopathy in a large number of people. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> Thus, the CMR is a key modality in MINOCA patients as it elucidates potential causes of myocardial damage and confirms the diagnosis of myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Ischaemic myocardial injury in the setting of COVID-19 infection may be driven by exacerbation of the pre-existing disease, destabilization of stable plaques or thrombotic and embolic phenomenon, along with endothelial dysfunction and microangiopathy. A direct viral effect or immune-mediated endothelium damage and microvascular inflammation can cause infarction and have been hypothesized as one mechanism by which COVID-19 individuals can have end-organ damage in the heart, brain and lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In our patient, we believe that the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection may predispose endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, leading to infarction, which can occur even in the absence of pre-existing disease or coronary risk factors in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【11】Due to the patient’s delayed presentation, we can’t be certain about infection onset. However, the mixed pattern presented in the CT of our patient, ground-glass opacities and bilateral consolidations are among CT features that were commonly reported in week three of COVID-19 illness, so we assume the onset of COVID-19 infection must have been earlier than the onset of chest pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. On the other hand, our patient was in a heart failure state, and the congestion can affect the CT features. It is, of course, also possible that, in this case, the acute myocardial infarction preceded COVID-19. This highlights an equally, if not more important, issue for cardiologists regarding poorer cardiovascular outcomes due to delay in seeking medical assistance for acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pattern of patient behavior has been consistent internationally, with European data demonstrating a reduction in ST-elevation myocardial infarction admissions since the beginning of the pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Therefore, while we tackle the immediate impact of the pandemic, we must also be mindful of its indirect effects and plan for how we best support patients now and highlight the importance of seeking timely medical care in either COVID-related or non-COVID-related emergencies.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ZR-E recognizes the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Integrated Academic Training Programme, which supports her Academic Clinical Lectureship Post and was also supported by British Heart Foundation Clinical Research Training Fellowship No. FS/17/81/33318.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We declare that we have taken a permission note from the patient parent to publish the case report.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has signed an informed consent form to participate in this study.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.H. is the guarantor of this study.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Availability of reports on PTs with size of 31 cm or more in diameter in the literature are extremely rare. Herein, the case of a 17-year-old female patient with a giant recurrent right breast PT is reported. Histologically, the tumour showed proliferation of stromal tumour cells consisting of spindle cells with uniform nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and proliferation labelling index for Ki67 of <10%. PTs require meticulous surgical excision due to the fact that they have a high rate of recurrence and status of surgical margins must be included in the pathology report. This is because recurrent cases of PTs tend to grow faster than the primary ones with a high chance of transforming to malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial tumours of the breast with incidence accounting for <1% of all breast tumours and 2.5% of fibroepithelial tumours, and they are classified as benign, borderline or malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These tumours are fast growing tumours and can reach a median size of 4 cm and sometimes can grow up to 50 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are few reported cases of PTs in adolescents.

Until 2015, there were only 20 cases of PTs in adolescents that were already reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Herein, an adolescent female with a highly recurrent and benign giant PT is being reported.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 17-year-old female was brought as an outpatient in the department of general surgery with a 2-year history of a huge ulcerating, painful and tender right breast mass. On physical examination, she was ill-looking, febrile and mildly wasted. She reported four different excisions in the past 2 years. Two excisions were done at a health centre and unfortunately the excised tumour masses were not evaluated histologically due to lack of pathology laboratory. The subsequent two excisions after recurrence were done at two different private hospitals. One histological report indicated fibroadenoma and the fourth report revealed benign PT. The right breast was very huge with ulcerating skin surface and was forming nodules . Ultrasound revealed a tumour, which measured 31 × 30 × 21 cm, calcified with regular borders and not fixed to the underlying tissue, but the left breast was normal. Chest X-ray showed clear lungs. Both fine-needle aspiration cytology and mammography could not be done because were not available. Modified radical mastectomy was performed by involving a significant amount of pectoralis major muscle. Macroscopically, the tumour was extensively necrotic, haemorrhagic and nodular. Grossly, the surgical margins were 3.4 cm far from the tumour . On microscopic examination, the tumour was hypercellular and was composed of uniform and slender spindle cells, and it was forming fascicles . The cells had uniform vesicular nuclear chromatin and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . A few mitotic figures <5 per 10 high-power fields were also seen . All ER, PR, HER2, SMA, S-100, vimentin and P53 antibodies were negative except Ki67 that showed proliferation labelling index of <10%. After a postoperative period of 8 months, she was found to be free from local recurrence or metastasis following evaluation with chest and abdominal computed tomography scan.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Clinical appearance of the lesion; ( **B** ) cut surface of the tumour is showing haemorrhage and necrosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Stromal hypercellularity of the lesion.

About 20% of the patients have palpable axillary lymphadenopathy and a significant proportion of the patients have history of fibroadenoma with up to 20% of them being with high local recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis study done by Lu _et al_ . in China reported the pooled local recurrence rates for benign, borderline and malignant PTs to be 8, 13 and 18%, respectively. This shows that the tendency of PTs to recur locally increases with increase in aggressiveness of the tumour. The study also reported that mitoses, tumour border, stromal cellularity, stromal atypia, stromal overgrowth and tumour necrosis can independently predict development of local recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The categorization of PTs into benign, borderline and malignant was described in the study by Salvadori _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Confirmation of diagnosis of PTs is done by histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Mammographically, PTs are clearly defined masses with a smooth and occasionally lobulated border, whereas on ultrasound they often show smooth contours with low-level homogenous internal echoes, intramural cysts without posterior acoustic enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Mammographically, both PTs and fibroadenoma show coarse microcalcification, but ‘malignant’ microcalcification in PTs is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It has been found that the presence of both epithelial and stromal elements within the cytological smear supports the diagnosis of PTs and not fibroadenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Surgery is the initial treatment for PTs with preferred wide excision for clear surgical margins, particularly for malignant ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The mean time for local recurrence has been reported to be around 2 years. This is different from the present case in which there were three consecutive local recurrences within a period of 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Options for failure to obtain negative surgical margins include re-excision, radical resection of the chest wall and reconstruction using a composite mesh (inner polytetrafluoroethylene and outer vypro), pedicle latissimus dorsi flap and a split skin graft for the recurrent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiotherapy have no proven benefits in the treatment of PT in regards to its recurrence and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In a study by Kario _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> reported that stromal overgrowth increases the possibility of local recurrence by seven times, whereas surgical margin <1 cm increases the risk by five times.\n\n【14】The case described in this report sheds light on the importance of evaluating histologically all excised breast lumps in order to confirm the diagnosis and not generalizing that every benign looking breast lump is fibroadenomas. This may help to avoid missing of the proper diagnosis as it was in the present case. This report also explains the importance of wide local excision for giant PTs (>10 cm in diameter), which helps to prevent local recurrence.\n\n【15】In summary, PTs are extremely rare in adolescents and they grow rapidly with a high risk of local recurrence. Ensuring wide excision during surgery is of utmost importance for obtaining negative surgical margins in order to prevent possibility of local recurrence.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author confirms that he had obtained a written informed consent from the patient’s parents for publication of the case details and any accompanying images.

However, dermatomal temperature and pain sensory loss have rarely been reported in patients with LMI. We describe the case of a patient with LMI presenting solely with temperature and pain sensory disorder below the C5 sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging findings demonstrated a small superficial infarction in the right lateral medulla oblongata, indicating that the sensory deficit was caused by a restricted infarction of the lateral spinothalamic tract. We emphasize the importance of adding LMI to a differential diagnosis of acute dermatomal sensory disturbance without other major symptoms of LMI, such as cranial nerve abnormalities, ataxia and Horner’s syndrome.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lateral medullary infarct (LMI), also known as Wallenberg syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome, is the most prevalent brainstem infarction in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is caused by the obstruction or dissection of the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the brainstem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. LMI characteristically involves the inferior cerebellar peduncle, lateral spinothalamic tract, trigeminal spinal cord nucleus, solitary nucleus, nucleus ambiguous and descending sympathetic tract fibres. Neurological symptoms characteristically include sensory disturbances (89%), dysarthria (75%), vertigo or nausea (73%), Horner’s syndrome (72%), cerebellar ataxia (69%), dysphagia (57%) and hiccups (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. As the nuclei and tracts are densely located within the lateral medulla oblongata, sensory disturbances are often accompanied by other neurological symptoms. However, pure sensory deficits caused by LMI are uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Moreover, isolated dermatomal dissociated sensory deficit mimicking spinal cord lesions have rarely been reported. Here, we report the case of a patient with caudal LMI presenting solely with temperature and pain sensory loss distributed along the dermatome.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 58-year-old woman presented with acute loss of temperature and pain sensation in the left side of her body and in the left limbs following cervical pain. She visited our hospital 3 days after symptom onset. Her medical history included asthma, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Her daily medications were prednisolone (3 mg), alfacalcidol (0.5 μg), rupatadine fumarate (10 mg) and rosuvastatin calcium (2.5 mg). On physical examination, she was alert, well-oriented and afebrile with a blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg. She had lost temperature and pain sensation below the left C5 sensory level , while her sensations of touch, position and vibration were intact. She showed no symptoms of any cranial nerve abnormalities, muscle weakness, abnormal tendon reflexes, ataxia, Horner’s syndrome or facial sensory loss. Her neurological symptoms were checked by two certificated neurologists.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Schematic presentation of pain and temperature sensation disorder ( **A** ).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed high-intensity signals in the right caudal lateral medulla oblongata on diffusion-weighted imaging , fluid-attenuated inversion recovery  and an enlarged right vertical artery . The MRI findings of the cervical spinal cord were normal. Consequently, we diagnosed her with LMI, suspecting right vertebral artery dissection as the aetiological cause. Therefore, we initiated clopidogrel administration (75 mg/day). Her sensory responses gradually improved from the left upper extremity on hospitalization day 3. Then, on hospitalization day 8, her sensory responses of the left lower extremity showed improvement. On hospitalization day 10, she was discharged to her home without any symptoms. At her 1-month follow-up examination, her neurological symptoms had improved substantially without stroke recurrence.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Sensory disturbance is the most common manifestation of LMI and occurs in 89% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is well known that the typical features of sensory disturbance are temperature and pain impairment on the ipsilateral face as well as contralateral limbs/body because LMI affects the ascending lateral spinothalamic tract and trigeminal spiral tract. However, the characteristics of sensory disturbance because of LMI may vary according to its size. With the recent advances in MRI, various patterns of sensory dysfunction have been reported in LMI cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Kim _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported the characteristics of sensory disturbance due to LMI in their case series of 50 consecutive patients. Their respective frequencies were as follows: ipsilateral face and contralateral limb/body disturbances (26%); contralateral face, trunk and limb disturbances (25%); limb/body involvement without trigeminal involvement (21%); bilateral trigeminal-contralateral limb/body disturbances (14%) and trigeminal involvement without limb/body involvement (10%).\n\n【10】Sensory disturbances are often accompanied by other neurological symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u> However, temperature and pain sensory loss on the contralateral trunk distributed along the dermatome without ipsilateral facial sensory loss have poorly been reported.\n\n【11】In this case, the MRI findings revealed a small lesion in the right superficial caudal lateral medullary oblongata . We speculate that the sensory deficit in this case was related to the somatotopic organization of the lateral spinothalamic tract. The lateral spinothalamic tract is an ascending sensory pathway composed of afferent nerve fibres that carry information regarding pain and temperature in the corresponding limb and trunk. In the spinal cord and brainstem, the ascending sensory nerve fibres from the sacral, lumbar, thoracic and cervical components are arranged from the lateral to the medial direction  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Based on her physical symptoms and MRI findings, the lateral infarction restricted to the lateral spinothalamic tract resulted in sensory deficits below the C5 sensory level .\n\n【12】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【13】Herein, we report a rare case of a small LMI confined to the lateral spinothalamic tract that subsequently developed into isolated dermatomal sensory loss. Clinicians should consider that LMI may vary in size and clinical symptoms; furthermore, the absence of cranial nerve palsy, ataxia or Horner’s syndrome does not rule out LMI.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to our patient for giving us permission to write up her case.

GMPC often manifests with obstructive urinary symptoms, urinary retention or pelvic pain. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice, however, not all patients are suitable for a surgical intervention, thereby presenting a case for alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment options. In this report, we present the first case of a patient in whom GMPC was concurrently diagnosed with an unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), with both lesions showing complete resolution following a 3-year course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old male was referred to our center for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion for localized PCa with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 8.0 ng/ml. The biopsy revealed the presence of a Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 mixed ductal and acinar carcinoma of the prostate in 3/3 cores in the left base, which was later correlated to a 17 × 7 × 15 mm (0.96 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) PI-RADS 5 lesion on staging multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>** . mpMRI also demonstrated a multiloculated cystic lesion arising from the prostatic base and extending into the bladder, measuring 72 × 41 × 53 mm (81.9 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 2 **)</u>** . On the right side, the locules were of intermediate T2 signal with areas of restricted diffusion, likely relating to blood products. On the left side, the locules showed higher T2 signal with no restricted diffusion, and areas of low T1 or high T1 signal intensity, likely relating to either simple fluid or proteinaceous material, respectively. No imaging features of local invasion were observed, with the described radiological appearance being in keeping with GMPC. A subsequent flexible cystoscopy showed no invasion of the mass into the bladder, and no malignant cells were seen on diagnostic cytology. The patient was prescribed an LHRH agonist with a 3-month interval MRI demonstrating a significant reduction in size of GMPC, then measuring 43 × 29 × 40 mm (26.1 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 3 **)</u>** . The previously noted lesion in the left prostatic peripheral zone also appeared less prominent, measuring 11 × 4 × 9 mm (0.20 cm <sup>3 </sup> ). Following 6 months of ADT, the patient underwent hypofractionated EBRT with 60 Gy delivered over 20 treatment sessions. No MRI was performed immediately post-EBRT, however, the EBRT planning CT scan demonstrated even further reduction of GMPC, making it virtually undetectable **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 4 **)</u>** . Following EBRT, the patient continued on LHRH agonist for a further 2 years with his PSA remaining < 0.04 ng/ml. A routine surveillance MRI scan, performed more than three and a half years after initial treatment, showed complete regression of both GMPC and the previously identified left peripheral zone lesion, with the final gland volume being 10.6 cm <sup>3 </sup> **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 3 **)</u>** .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Axial T2WI (a) and diffusion-weighted imaging (b), alongside apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping (c) of the pelvis.

The 4-fold reduction in the GMPC volume reported after the initial 3-month ADT, alongside its further reduction seen on EBRT computed tomography (CT) planning scan, highlight the key role of castration in the observed phenomenon, likely driven by targeting the androgen receptor, which is known to be expressed on GMPC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These findings are in line with the single published report of noninvasive treatment of recurrent unresectable GMPC with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which also demonstrated a positive result, with no further recurrence observed on continuous ADT. In the present report, interim EBRT could also have an add-on effect on GMPC resolution, e.g. by means of destroying its feeding vessel. Overall, these findings suggest that ADT is effective in treating both primary and recurrent GMPC, thereby serving as a promising alternative to invasive surgical treatment.\n\n【12】GMPC can be diagnosed at any age between 16 and 80 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with its presenting symptoms being similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including lower urinary symptoms, urinary retention, hematuria and elevated serum PSA levels. Radiologically, GMPCs present as large retroperitoneal masses located between the bladder and rectum, showing multilocular cavities and cysts of various sizes. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging may provide additional information on the presence and the nature of any GMPC soft tissue components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Being aware of radiological features of GMPC, alongside other pelvic masses or congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract, is of considerable clinical relevance given the increasing use of MRI for diagnosis, local staging and follow-up imaging of PCa, which may lead to a more frequent incidental detection of this rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Additionally, to our knowledge, the concomitant diagnosis of GMPC and biopsy-proven PCa demonstrated in this report has not been presented previously.\n\n【13】As there are no pathognomonic histopathological signs of GMPC that could enable its confident diagnosis by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, it is important to consider several differential diagnoses that include other lower male genitourinary tract cysts (Müllerian, prostatic, seminal vesicle and utricle), prostatic leiomyoma, lymphangioma, teratoma, liposarcoma, hydatid disease and phyllodes variant of atypical prostatic hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Given the size and possible adherence to surrounding organs, complete surgical excision of GMPC, which is required to prevent the disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, often becomes a traumatic operation with major complications being bladder and rectum perforation, pelvic abscess, anal canal injury and rectal leak 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. As evidenced by this report, a short-term ADT course may be used as a preoperative volume-reducing step aimed at decreasing the invasiveness of GMPC surgical removal. In cases when radical treatment is contraindicated or can be avoided due to the mild nature of GMPC-related symptoms, strong consideration should be given to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option capable of achieving complete GMPC resolution.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】In conclusion, we reported the first case of complete regression of a GMPC observed on consecutive MRI scans following 3 years of ADT with an LHRH agonist. The reported observation warrants further attention to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option for patients with GMPC in whom complete surgical resection is either contraindicated or can be deferred.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this report.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent to publish the anonymized MR images was obtained in writing.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The guarantor of the study is Dr Tristan Barrett.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In normal physiological state specific gravity has no effect on contrast agent dynamics.

Six other family members affected with MJD died of the same pulmonary complication. To date, there has been no direct genetic linkage between MJD and familial spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the mutated ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene in MJD and Serpin Family A Member 1 (SERPINA1) gene in hereditary emphysema share the same loci on chromosome 14q32.1, which is suggestive of genetic proclivity of patients with MJD to develop familial pneumothorax. Furthermore, the abnormal ataxin protein encoded by ATXN3 and the patient’s smoking history could have potentiated the dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system further aggravating his genetic predisposition to develop recurrent pneumothorax.

Types are classified according to the genetic loci of the SCA. Of over 35 types of SCA identified, the most common is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, known as Machado–Joseph disease (MJD), which is caused by cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) expansions in the ATNX3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since 1997, only one case has been reported on recurrent familial pneumothorax in two siblings with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

In fact, established genetic variants in PSP only include human leukocyte antigen haplotype A2B40, alpha-1 antitrypsin, fibrillin 1 and folliculin mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report the first known case of recurrent familial spontaneous pneumothorax in a patient diagnosed with MJD highlighting the possible genetic correlation between these two disease entities.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】Our patient is a 42-year-old African American man who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. He had oropharyngeal dysphagia, productive cough, weight loss, blurred vision, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Since the age of 18 when he was diagnosed with MJD, he had progressively lost muscle control and coordination of his extremities until he was wheelchair-bound by age 38. He reported having recurrent aspiration pneumonia in his late 30s. In the previous year, he had two episodes of left-sided pneumothorax, which required thoracoscopic drainage and decortication. He had a 20-pack-year history of smoking.\n\n【7】On presentation, blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiration was 28 breaths/min and temperature was 37°C. He appeared chronically ill with generalized muscle wasting. Decreased tactile fremitus, hyperresonance and absent breath sounds in the right hemithorax were noted. Significant neurological exam findings included slow saccades, dysarthria, tongue fasciculations, rigid extremities with hyperreflexia, bilateral extensor plantar response, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, without sensorimotor deficits. Chest radiograph showed a large pneumothorax of the right lung with contralateral mediastinal shift .

Repeat chest radiography after 2 weeks demonstrated a small right-sided pleural effusion and subpleural blebs without recurrence of pneumothorax.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】MJD is one of nine known polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases and is the most common autosomal dominant ataxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–7 \\]</u>. The patient’s family pedigree demonstrates the well-established 10-year ‘anticipation’ of worsening disease progression, suggesting that the larger numbers of CAG repeats will manifest in more progressive and severe disease with each successive generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, our patient had clinical manifestations demonstrative of the early onset subtype with progressive motor coordination and muscle control loss, resulting in being wheelchair-bound at age 38.\n\n【16】Spontaneous pneumothorax is a manifestation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously linked to MJD. It occurs without preceding trauma or obvious precipitating causes. In the absence of an underlying lung disease, it is termed primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) with an annual incidence of 7.4–37 per 100 000 in men and 1.2–15.4 per 100 000 in women and typically seen among young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. One retrospective study found 23.5% recurrence of PSP within the first 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The presence of subpleural blebs and bullae is seen in 80–90% of PSP cases. Other risk factors include cigarette smoke exposure, cannabis smoking and genetic predisposition. On the other hand, 80% of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax cases are seen in patients older than 55. Its typical causes include emphysema, interstitial lung disease, malignancy and necrotizing pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Given the presence of an underlying lung disease as well as contributing risk factors of smoking and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, the diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in our patient would seem less likely. However, with his significant history of MJD, and collateral history that six affected members died of pneumothorax complications, we believe that our patient has inherited susceptibility to spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n【18】The underlying pathogenetic defect of MJD is the CAG trinucleotide repeat found within the 5′ coding region of ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14q32.1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Interestingly, this is where the chromosome of the mutated SERPINA1 gene of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency underlying hereditary emphysema is located 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>. Recent data shows that the SERPINA1 gene acts as a protective agent in the lungs against neutrophilic proteolytic activity during inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Once mutated, it can predispose affected individuals to emphysema. Additionally, ATXN3 gene is responsible for the formation of the ataxin protein that is expressed in both neuronal and nonneuronal human tissue. A derangement of this system results in the accumulation of inclusional protein. This accounts for the progressive ataxia, dystonia and neuropathy in MJD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】There is also a growing evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism is responsible for homeostasis in the lung. Proteasomes aid in immunological defense against pathogens via antigen presentation. In a patient whose pathway is dysfunctional, this could theoretically lead to lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 10 \\]</u>. Furthermore, cigarette smoke also induces protein misfolding and aggregation. We posit that the dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may have been an additional factor that contributed to the recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax seen in our patient with MJD.\n\n【20】Further inquiries of the pathogenesis of extra-neuronal manifestations can be useful to our understanding of MJD. Although we don’t have sufficient data to prove that no other mutations are present in this patient to explain recurrent pneumothorax, the proximity of the aforementioned genes on the same chromosome loci should not be dismissed, nor should the potential for co-inheritance of these variants. This exploration invokes further molecular characterization to amplify medical knowledge and guide novel therapies that target the degradation of protein/s in MJD.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thank you Dr Lo and Dr Azmaiparashvili for the guided supervision in taking care of our patient and in editing this manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of interest statement._ No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no monetary or material support for this research investigation.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent form was duly completed before writing the manuscript.

The urine in PUBS gets its color from the combination of two pigments, indirubin and indigo, which are breakdown products of tryptophan. The most important risk factors include long-term catheterization, female gender, chronic constipation, old age and being bed bound. Here, we present a case of PUBS in an elderly female with a history of bladder cancer that needed catheterization along with constipation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare complication of urinary tract infection (UTI) with prevalence ranging between 8.3 and 42.1% among patients with long-term indwelling catheters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The urine entering the catheter is normal in color, yet purple discoloration soon appears. This is due to the development of indigo (blue in color) and indirubin (red in color) by the presence of urinary bacteria. These pigments interact with the plastic material of the catheter bag and tubing to produce the purple discoloration by producing a coating layer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although it is benign in nature and only changes occur in the color of urine from yellow to purple, PUBS results in greater anxiety in patients.\n\n【4】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【5】A 76-year-old female with medical history significant for congestive Stage III chronic kidney disease and bladder cancer presented to the hospital with shortness of breath from congestive heart failure exacerbation. Further investigation revealed an acute kidney injury secondary to cardiorenal syndrome and kidney ultrasound showed mild-to-moderate right-sided hydronephrosis from invasive bladder cancer. A Foley catheter was placed to relieve obstruction and she was placed on intravenous furosemide for congestive heart failure exacerbation. In addition, the patient has been constipated since admission and after 4 days, a change in the urine color was noted in the Foley bag . Urine dipstick analysis showed alkaline urine (pH of 8.5) with a large amount of blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase and proteins. Urine culture revealed >100 000 CFU/ml of _Proteus mirabilis_ . Computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis revealed constipation with stercoral colitis and moderate right-sided hydronephrosis with a thickened bladder wall but no stones. The patient was started on a course of ceftriaxone 1 g daily and miralax/senna twice daily with lactulose as needed for constipation. Based upon the patient’s history and the microbiology results, a diagnosis of PUBS was made. Her constipation resolved, and a 5-day course of antibiotics was completed. The patient was discharged to a nursing facility with recommendations to follow up with her nephrologist and urologist as an outpatient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Dark purple urine in the Foley catheter bag.

This is an uncommon phenomenon and most commonly seen in patients with permanent urinary catheterization in combination with a highly alkaline UTI (about 9.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Numerous organisms have been reported as being responsible for purple urine bag and include _Providencia stuartii_ , _Providencia rettgeri_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Proteus species_ , _Escherichia coli_ , _Enterococcus species_ , _Morganella morganii_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of this phenomenon can be traced back to the catabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found only in our diet which aids in the production of proteins, enzymes and other components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. With the help of bacteria, tryptophan is broken down in the gut into indole where it is then taken to the liver and turned into indoxyl sulfate. Sulfatase-producing bacteria in the urinary tract convert indoxyl sulfate into indoxyl which, when metabolized in an alkaline environment, gives rise to indirubin (red pigment) and indigo (blue pigment). When these pigments are combined and oxidized, the urine becomes purple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Gastrointestinal conditions such as obstruction, intussusception and ileal diversions can also increase PUBS, presumably because the bacteria are allowed more time to grow and deaminate tryptophan as in constipated patients. Elderly and bedridden patients with multiple comorbidities more often require long-term indwelling catheters which increase their risk of UTIs; such patients are more likely to be infected by the rarer bacteria which can go on to cause PUBS 通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>. Although PUBS is generally considered benign on its own, it may progress to more severe disease (i.e. Fournier’s gangrene) if immunocompromised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Medical management of PUBS requires changing the catheter and administering appropriate antimicrobial therapy to treat the underlying bacterial infection.\n\n【10】### Teaching Points\n\n【11】*   PUBS can be associated with many different types of bacteria in the urinary tract.\n\n【12】*   The urine in PUBS gets its color from the combination of two pigments, indirubin and indigo, which are breakdown products of tryptophan.\n\n【13】*   PUBS is most commonly associated with alkaline urine and is usually observed in elderly women who have catheter-related UTIs and are constipated.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The case has been presented as an abstract for poster competition at the American Society of Nephrology 2022.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the authorship, and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A.A.B. designed the study and contributed to case presentation and discussion.

We report a case of a patient with brain stem cavernous malformations presented as pure COPS with additional sensory disturbance in the thorax. We report this case to raise awareness of these very rare syndromes and demonstrate that mildly presenting symptoms can be caused by an underlying devastating condition.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cavernous malformations (CMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels lined with endothelial cells that do not exhibit intervening tight junctions, lack muscular and elastic layers and are filled with blood at varying degrees of thrombosis. The incidence of cerebral CMs ranges from 0.4 to 0.8%; they comprise 10–15% of all vascular malformations in the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. CMs present in a sporadic typically single-lesion form and a familial form, which usually has multiple lesions, comprises 30–50% of cases, and are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in one of the _CCM1_ , _CCM2_ or _CCM3_ genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

He had a history of dyslipidemia and anxiety disorder, for which he was taking simvastatin and escitalopram. His body temperature was 36.7°C, his pulse was 90 bpm, and his blood pressure was 128/86 mmHg. Neurologic examination revealed that the patient was alert, his cranial nerves were intact, his motor power was grade V in all extremities, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal. Objective sensory deficit was not seen. We suspected COPS with additional thorax involvement. COPS is usually due to a lesion in the thalamocortical projections or thalamus and brainstem. The differential diagnosis of COPS in this patient included lacunar infarction because he had a risk factor for dyslipidemia, hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral vascular malformations such as CMs, and arteriovenous malformations were also possible differential diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|The patient had paresthesia around the corner of the right side of the mouth, and in the hand, foot and lateral thoracic region of the same side.</u>\n\n【7】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined lesion in the left side of the dorsal pons, measuring 1.2 × 1.1 cm and showing T1 hyperintensity without enhancement, T2 hyperintensity with a hemosiderin rim and surrounding edema, and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and was diagnosed with a bleeding CM . Because his symptoms did not disturb his quality of life and the lesion was located in the deep pons, where the morbidity associated with the intervention is high.

COPS was first described in patients with midbrain and pontine hemorrhagic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A further report documented unilateral sensory disturbances in the thoracic region, in addition to the hand, mouth and foot regions due to lesions in the thalamus and thalamocortical projections; additional symptoms included headache, diplopia and/or hemiparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with very rare COPS with thoracic region involvement without additional symptoms. COPS could be explained by partial involvement of the medial lemniscus, thalamus or thalamocortical projections. In the medial lemniscus in the pons, the closeness of the sensory fibers from the head, arm, trunk and leg can be explained by COPS with thoracic involvement in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient was high risk of misdiagnosis because he presented with unfamiliar sensory symptoms without other abnormal symptoms along with a history of anxiety disorder.\n\n【11】Brainstem CMs account for 20–35% of all CMs and have higher incidence rates of hemorrhaging and re-hemorrhaging than non-brainstem CMs (2.8 vs. 0.3%, and 32.3% vs. 6.3% per patient-year, respectively) and a low mortality rate of 2.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The risk factors of CMs hemorrhaging include young age, female sex, prior hemorrhage and a deep location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice, especially SWI sequences and gradient echo sequences that demonstrate the area of prior hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Brain MRI of our patient showed hyperintensities on both T1-and T2 weighted sequences and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on SWI sequence due to their subacute hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Management options include observation or surgery: surgical resection, radiosurgery or stereotactic laser ablation. Observation may be preferred despite a lesion being symptomatic if the intervention risk is high, such as with deeply located CMs. Postoperative brainstem CMs morbidity occurred in 34.8% including motor deficits, sensory deficits, tracheostomy/gastrostomy requirement and other cranial nerve deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. If repeated hemorrhages lead to progressive neurological morbidity, surgery may be considered. In our patient, observation was considered because he had only sensory symptoms. and the lesion was located in the deep pons, where the morbidity associated with the intervention is high.\n\n【14】We report this case of brainstem CMs presented with isolated COPS with additional thorax involvement to raise awareness of these very rare syndromes. We consider COPS an underreported condition because the mild sensory symptoms can be easily misdiagnosed by a physician, and the patients may not be concerned about their symptoms, which are linked to serious conditions. The occurrence of COPS as a presentation of neurological disease should be investigated in neurological patients, especially stroke patients, to raise awareness and prevent misdiagnosis of serious conditions.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by the Prapokklao Hospital Ethics Committee.

Subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD) was listed in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> as an alternative therapeutic option with a class-IIa recommendation in patients for whom is indicated ICD not requiring pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronization therapy or anti-tachycardia pacing. However, problems and complications associated with the device are relevant and may lead to a poor prognosis. Transvenous electrodes of ICDs have caused problems such as lead injury and infection, myocardial damage and pericarditis. S-ICD is a completely extra thoracic and extravascular system. Therefore, it can be removed even if infection of a pacemaker occurs. Little has been reported on lead dislodgement with S-ICD. We experienced lead dislodgement of S-ICD within 1 month following the two-incision technique in a patient with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT is a relatively rare genetic arrhythmia disorder. Using the two-incision technique for lead fixation to active and sporting patients may induce lead dislodgement, and the three-incision technique may be preferable.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 16-year-old male visited our hospital complaining of fainting during swimming and exercise. He almost drowned during swimming and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation twice. He belonged to the baseball club and was a pitcher and batter. No special abnormalities were identified in the 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia appeared frequently during a treadmill testing . CPVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u> was suspected and so he was treated with flecainide and carvedilol. In addition, genetic testing at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (Suita, Japan) revealed a point mutation in exon8 of the ryanodine (RYR2) receptor. He was admitted at our hospital for implantation of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD). Screening of the body surface using an ECG screening tool determined eligibility for S-ICD. The two-incision technique was selected from a cosmetic point of view that wounding of young patients should be less. The implantation was performed in an electrophysiology laboratory under general anesthesia. Extra-thoracic lead of S-ICD was placed using a two-incision technique. The sleeve of the xiphoid incision was fixed firmly with ETHIBOND EXCEL® polyester suture. The position of the defibrillation lead was confirmed by chest X-ray . The patient was discharged on day 7 post-implantation. Telemedicine monitoring was performed via the LATITUDE ™ system. Although he was prohibited from exercising, he was unable to comply and was participating in baseball games the day following discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Twelve-lead ECG displayed in the treadmill test, and two types of ventricular arrhythmias appeared on the electrocardiogram during the exercise load, namely, the lower and the upper axis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|(A) Chest X-ray showing that the extra thoracic lead and generator of S-ICD were first located in the left lateral side; (B) outpatient chest X-ray showed dislodgement of the defibrillation electrode leads in the Para sternum; (C) chest X-ray after replacement of S-ICD using a three-incision technique.</u>\n\n【11】Outpatient chest X-ray showed dislodgement of an extra-thoracic lead . The lead dropped out during the outpatient examination at 3 weeks post-implantation, and the lead tip was in the lower one third of the sternum. There was no over sensing in the pacemaker check when the lead dropped, and no inappropriate shock of the S-ICD was found. Immediately after re-hospitalization, the dropped S-ICD lead was removed the next day and re-placed by a three-incision technic under intravenous anesthesia .\n\n【12】The alternative EGM in the remote monitoring SMARTPASS was later found to have changed the polarity of the QRS from positive to negative, and remote monitoring could detect the loss of the S-ICD lead .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|(A) Subcutaneous electrocardiogram (S-ECG) of remote monitoring SMARTPASS at pre-dislodgement, QRS positive of extrathoracic lead, and (B) S-ECG of remote monitoring SMARTPASS, QRS negative.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The two-incision technique is a safe and efficacious alternative for S-ICD implantations and offers physicians a less invasive and simplified implantation procedure of the S-ICD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Lead dislodgement of S-ICD is a rare complication; however, there have been reports of leads dislodgement with the two-incision technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, due to patient motion or manual movement of the S-ICD generator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We used the two-incision technique instead of three incisions for cosmetic reasons as the patient was a juvenile, but for patients that are sports players however, we use the three-incision technique in order to fix the lead more firmly. We found that the S-ICD lead may drop out in patients who perform much exercise as in the present case, so the three-incision technique is desirable and information by remote monitoring is useful.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】The three-incision technique may be preferable over the two-incision technique in the case of juveniles that are active in sports etc. and S-ICD patients.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nobuyuki Ogasawara is the guarantor of the content of this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She had stopped visiting an outpatient clinic because the adenoma, though enlarging, was asymptomatic. Three days after onset of an upper respiratory tract infection, she developed stridor and difficulty breathing and had a cardiopulmonary arrest. Chest compressions and manual bag ventilation were immediately initiated by in-house nurses, restoring spontaneous circulation. On admission to a hospital, she was found to have a huge elastic mass in her oropharyngeal space . A Cormack grade 3 view was achieved on direct laryngoscopy by an experienced emergency physician; however, endotracheal intubation was not successful. Repeat laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope (Airway Scope®, Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) provided a Cormack grade 1 view, enabling intubation of her trachea with a 7.0-mm endotracheal tube. Computed tomography scan revealed a homogeneous mass (5.4 × 5.0 × 3.5 cm) compressing the oropharyngeal space .

This research paper examines the case of an 18-month-old Syrian female who had been diagnosed with intussusception. The patient underwent laparotomy, and multiple small bowel polyps were found to act as the lead point. For this reason, small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Although PJS diagnosis was histopathologically confirmed, the patient had no pigmented lesions on the face, the lower lip or the buccal mucosa and neither had any history of hospitalization or family history of the disease. This case was examined and is reported in the present study because PJS is rarely present at this early age when significant medical history is lacking.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomatous polyps and pigmented macules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hamartomatous polyps are most commonly found in the small intestine but may also be seen in the stomach and colon. The average age for the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms is 13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and ~50% of patients will suffer from polyps complications—such as intussusception, obstruction and rectal bleeding—by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Common in more than 90% of affected individuals, mucocutaneous pigmented lesions tend to arise in infancy, occurring around the mouth, nostrils, perianal area, fingers and toes and may be the first signs of PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common symptom is recurrent colicky abdominal pain caused by transient intussusception or obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of PJS is assumed if any of the following criteria is met: (i) two or more PJS polyps; (ii) any number of PJS polyps and a history of PJS in a close relative; (iii) characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation in an individual with a history of PJS in a close relative; or (iv) any number of PJS polyps with characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 3 \\]</u>. The majority of individuals with PJS have been found to have genetic alterations in LKB1, and up to 25% of those diagnosed have _de novo_ STK11 mutations with no family history of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PJS is associated with a progressively increasing lifetime risk of developing malignancies—by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-month-old Syrian female baby was admitted to our hospital with complaints of acute abdominal pain, several episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting and red diarrhea. She had neither prior hospitalization nor any significant symptoms in her own medical history, and her family’s history for PJS was negative. On admission, her vital signs were normal, and physical examination did not reveal any peculiar pigmented lesions. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness, diminished bowel sounds and a possible palpable epigastric mass. Blood analysis indicated low hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g ̸dl (n:12 to16 g ̸dl), a mean cell volume of 63.2 F ̸L (N:72–100 F ̸L), but other initial laboratory results were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography, in turn, revealed typical ‘target and pseudo-kidney’ signs. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with small bowel intussusception . Consequently, laparotomy was performed, and surgical examination detected jejunal palpable masses in the intussusceptum. Enterotomy revealed multiple polyps on the mucosal surface , and small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Post-operative course was uneventful. Histopathologic study was conducted on the resected portion, which consisted of a 15-cm specimen from the small bowel containing more than 100 pedunculated polyps on mucosal surface ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm in diameter .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Small bowel intussusception.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Enterotomy.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Multiple polyps on the mucosal surface.</u>\n\n【9】Microscopic examination of polyps showed proliferation of papillary and glandular formations lined by hyperplastic epithelial cells. Stroma was rich in smooth muscle fiber arising from the muscularis mucosae and infiltrated with patchy mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate . Neither adenomatous change nor malignancy was observed after a thorough examination. On the basis of two or more PJS polyps, the diagnosis of PJS syndrome was confirmed.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Microscopic image; ( **b** ) microscopic image; ( **c** ) microscopic image.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】PJS is an autosomal dominant condition, which was first described by Peutz in 1921, and it was not until 1949 that Jeghers defined the relation between pigmented lesions and gastrointestinal polyposis, on the one hand, and an increased risk of carcinoma, on the other 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent laparotomy following clinical symptoms of intussusception—confirmed by ultrasonography, and PJS was diagnosed with the help of histopathologic evaluation of the excised bowel. Here we ought to mention that laparoscopy is increasingly the preferred approach for diagnosis and management of acute abdominal and can be performed safely for bowel resection and anastomosis. However, the procedure was not available in the hospital where the study was conducted. Gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps are characteristic of PJS, and they are most commonly found in the small intestine but can also be found in other intestinal or extraintestinal sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The median time to first presentation with polyps is about 11–13 years of age, and ~50% will have experienced intussusception, obstruction or rectal bleeding by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Although the association between PJS and intussusception is not uncommon, this complication is rarely presented as a first clue of PJS. What is peculiar about our patient is that she presented with intussusception at the age of 18 months as the first complication of PJS.\n\n【13】Mucocutaneous pigmentation is typically found in over 90% of PJS cases but fades with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.The phenotype varies considerably from diffuse, dark freckling over the face to light pigmentation in characteristic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical examination of our patient, however, did not reveal any pigmented lesions. PJS is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene (also called LKB1) located at 19p13.3, as it encodes a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a tumor suppressor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Mutations in this gene are detected in 50—90% of individuals with PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although PJS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, up to 25% of cases do not have any family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Similarly, our patient did not have history of PJS in a close relative, and thus her case should be categorized as sporadic PJS, especially given that the authors of this study lacked the means to conduct genetic testing of the case under examination.\n\n【14】PJS is associated with a significantly increased risk of both intestinal and extraintestinal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. It rises with age, by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinical guidelines for the surveillance and management of PJS-affected individuals have been established; upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy should be performed every 2–3 years, starting from late teens. Additionally, small bowel visualization should start at the age of 8–10 and should be repeated every 2–3 years. Other screening procedures include clinical examination and specific imaging to screen for lesions of the breast, female genital tract, testis and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, management and follow-up methods for PJS patients continue to be somewhat controversial.\n\n【15】In conclusion, intussusception may be the first lead for PJS regardless of age, family history or pigmentation.\n\n【16】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【17】None declared.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】The authors did not receive any funding to conduct this study.\n\n【20】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【21】No ethical approval was needed.\n\n【22】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【23】Consent has been duly obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Current British Society of Rheumatology advice is to stop TCZ 3-months pre-conception. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with extensive TA treated with TCZ, azathioprine and glucocorticoids in pregnancy. She was closely monitored with MDT input and TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy as the benefits were thought to outweigh the risks. Our case also highlights the importance of accurate blood pressure monitoring in an appropriate anatomical location, given the extent of her disease. Our patient’s disease remained stable throughout the antenatal and post-partum period with a successful pregnancy outcome and no maternal or foetal complications. TCZ is suitable for select cases of refractory TA during pregnancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) is a large vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology. Glucocorticoid therapy is a mainstay of treatment. More recently, tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, has been approved in resistant or refractory disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Because of the limited data in pregnancy, current British Society of Rheumatology guidance is to stop TCZ 3 months prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】### CASE REPORT\n\n【5】We report a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian lady (Gravida 2, Para 1) with TA treated with TCZ throughout pregnancy at a tertiary specialist Foetal and Maternal Medicine—Rheumatology combined clinic.\n\n【6】The patient gave a 4-year history of daily headache with photophobia diagnosed previously as migraine. In January 2017, she presented with 3 days of malaise with typical headache and right sided upper limb aching with incoordination. The following day she presented with repeated 10-min episodes of left facial and upper limb weakness and word-finding difficulties. She was reviewed by neurology team and her workup suggested a right carotid territory dissection with parietal cortex involvement on MR imaging; however, MR angiography revealed widespread large vessel vasculitis with proximal right brachiocephalic, right common carotid artery, left carotid artery origin and left Subclavian involvement . Given the findings she was diagnosed with TA.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Comparison of the MR angiographic findings between January 2017 (Image 1) and December 2018 (Image 2). The arteries are labelled numerically as follows: brachiocephalic artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>, initially stenosed, subsequently progressed with occlusion from aortic arch to the vertebral artery origin. Right common carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> was severely narrowed with only a trickle flow proximally and occluded up to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the right internal carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> is severely narrowed initially and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan. Right vertebral artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> was initially severely attenuated, with only a trickle flow, and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan and appeared almost normal. Left common carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> was initially severely narrowed over a short segment from the aortic arch origin becomes occluded from the arch to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the left internal carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>, initially normal, subsequently shows moderately severe narrowing in the neck. The left subclavian artery has a short segment of severe stenosis, which had progressed slightly, whereas the distal subclavian artery narrowing in the supraclavicular fossa had resolved. Left vertebral artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> is dominant and was not affected initially, and becomes hypertrophic on subsequent scan.</u>\n\n【8】Initial treatment was with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1 gram and IV cyclophosphamide. IV methylprednisolone was given for 5 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisolone. The inflammatory markers improved but had not normalized. Following the seventh course of cyclophosphamide, she had a left middle cerebral artery embolic event in late 2017. Angiogram showed progression of the disease in the major arteries of the neck . Because of refractory disease, her treatment was changed to subcutaneous TCZ (162 mg weekly), azathioprine and a weaning dose of prednisolone (25 mg). Azathioprine was started at 50 mg daily and escalated to 100 mg. She conceived on this combination and was assessed first time in our combined Rheumatology/Obstetrics clinic at 14 weeks gestation (March 2019). She had no other co-morbidities and was a non-smoker. Baseline blood pressure (BP) in her thigh was 130/84 mmHg and 90/68 and 67/53 mmHg in her left and right arms, respectively. Her Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS) at first pregnancy visit was 0 (scored retrospectively by INB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and her CRP was 5 mg/l (normal < 5.0). Given her extensive disease and previous life-threatening complications and following detailed discussion with the patient and her partner, a decision to continue TCZ was made, with close monitoring and multi-disciplinary support. A steroid-taper of 5 mg every 4 weeks was initiated, and she was started on aspirin 150 mg at night and tinzaparin 4500 IU daily.\n\n【9】BP monitoring used her thigh or calf and at 22 weeks, amlodipine 5 mg daily was added as her BP was 170/70 mmHg. Ultrasound assessments of placental function were performed at 17 and 22 weeks. There was normal foetal growth and both uterine artery dopplers demonstrated normal resistance waveforms. Because of risk of pre-eclampsia urine protein ratio was check at each clinic visit and this remained within normal range (0–30 mg/mmol).\n\n【10】Prednisolone was further tapered to 7.5 mg daily by 34 weeks and maintained through the rest of her pregnancy. Systemically, she had no TA flares; at her 34-week visit her ITAS score remained 0 and her CRP was <1.0 mg/L. There were concerns over the risks of vaginal delivery, and an elective caesarean section (CS) was planned at 39 weeks gestation. However, spontaneous labour occurred 2 days before her scheduled admission date and she had an emergency CS. She delivered a baby girl weighing 2768 grams with no peri-partum maternal or foetal complications. TCZ and azathioprine were withheld during the peri-partum period for 2–3 weeks until her CS wound healed and she had IV hydrocortisone 25 mg three times daily for 48 h and then prednisolone was continued at 7.5 mg daily.\n\n【11】Few months later 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>, she underwent MRA brain and carotid to assess disease status. Imaging was discussed at neuroradiology multidisciplinary team meeting; the stenotic lesion remained stable and there were no radiographic features to suggest disease progression.\n\n【12】Subsequently she has been maintained on TCZ and AZA and her prednisolone was tapered to 5 and 7.5 mg alternate days. More recent imaging 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u> confirms disease stability. At the time of reporting, her baby is 40 months old and is healthy.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Relapsing, resistant TA poses significant challenges during pregnancy. Whilst biologics are discontinued prior to pregnancy or early in the first trimester; uncontrolled or flaring disease can put both the mother and foetus at risk of complications such as worsening hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity and/or intra-uterine growth restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. High-dose glucocorticoids also contribute to BP dysregulation and impaired glucose tolerance, thus adding to overall pregnancy risks.\n\n【15】TCZ provides good disease control and is steroid sparing. No relevant placental transfer of IgG1 occurs in the first trimester; however, transfer can increasingly occur through the second and third trimesters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Current guidelines suggest stopping TCZ 3 months prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Data regarding TCZ safety in pregnancy are mainly from RA patients. One case series of prenatal or early first trimester exposure to TCZ found that in 180 prospective and 108 retrospective cases there was no substantial increase in the rate of congenital malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The rate of spontaneous abortion (21%) was similar to the general population (10–20%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A retrospective analysis of 61 Japanese RA patients on TCZ found that the rate of spontaneous abortion (18%), congenital abnormalities (none) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (10%) were similar to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this study, only one patient continued TCZ throughout pregnancy and delivered a baby with a low birth weight (<2000 g).\n\n【17】We found two cases of patients taking TCZ in pregnancy for TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. As with our case, both had refractory disease with extensive damage. TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy in one patient and stopped at 6 weeks gestation in the other. Pregnancy outcomes were favourable apart from one case developing neonatal jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】More recently TCZ has been widely used for the management of severe COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ten pregnant patients were included in trial; however, no specific maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted. In another retrospective study of 12 pregnant women with COVID-19 receiving TCZ, all pregnancies resulted in live births, there were two reports of transient hepatotoxicity and one of cytomegalovirus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. To gain further understanding and effect of immunomodulators on pregnancy and neonatal outcome, a more robust regulatory structure for recruiting pregnant patient in clinical trial is warranted.\n\n【19】Our case had aggressive TA and since the benefits of continuing TCZ to maintain stable disease outweighed the theoretical risks, TCZ was continued through pregnancy with a successful outcome. This case also highlights the need for accurate monitoring BP in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. In selected cases, TCZ therefore has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【21】In selected cases, TCZ has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy. It is pertinent to monitor BP accurately in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. Our case report also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary team role in managing such complex cases.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】No approval required.\n\n【26】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

She appeared pale, and her blood pressure was 60/31 mmHg; heart rate, 150 beats/min and oxygen saturation, 74% on room air. Physical examination revealed jugular venous distension and wheezes in both lungs. The admission electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed features of cardiac tamponade and compression of the heart by a large high-echoic mass. Respiratory status improved promptly with oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but cardiogenic shock did not improve sufficiently with extracellular fluid and noradrenaline administration.

When symptomatic, common clinical findings of IVC agenesis include chronic varicose veins, stasis dermatitis, skin ulcerations, DVTs and in severe cases venous thromboembolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Recently, vascular abnormalities have also been found to represent an important risk factor for development of unprovoked DVTs and should be included in the workup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present here the case of a middle-aged man with history of unprovoked DVT in the right lower extremity (RLE), presenting for acute DVT in the same limb.\n\n【11】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【12】A 42-year-old man with history of asthma, and two episodes of unprovoked RLE DVTs not on anticoagulation, presented to the emergency department after 3 days of progressive bilateral lower extremity swelling and pain.\n\n【13】The patient denied any recent trauma, travel history, prolonged immobilization, surgery or shortness of breath. He was a former smoker with 20 pack-year history, but denied illicit drug use. He has no pertinent family history, including history of coagulopathies. His first episode of RLE DVT occurred at 35 years of age and was treated with 6 months of warfarin 5 mg daily. The second unprovoked DVT episode occurred 5 years later and patient was then placed on lifelong anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, but reports stopping medication after 10 months. Workup for underlying thrombophilia or etiology was complicated by poor health care follow-up with both prior DVT’s.\n\n【14】On physical exam, patient had bilateral lower extremity edema up to the thighs (right worse than left) that were warm to touch and tender to palpation. Tortuous veins were found in the posterior aspect of the legs bilaterally up to the mid-thigh, as well as chronic venous skin changes. Duplex US of RLE showed chronic DVT of the proximal and mid-femoral vein and an acute DVT of the distal femoral and popliteal veins. US also showed dampened respiratory variation in the right common femoral vein concerning for a proximal DVT. Subsequently, a pelvic CT scan was obtained to rule out proximal DVT and incidentally showed absent infrarenal segment of the IVC with dilation of the iliac, ascending lumbar, azygous and hemiazygos veins . During this time, extensive thrombophilia workup including prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, homocysteine, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and beta-glycoprotein was negative.\n\n【15】The patient was treated with rivaroxaban 15 mg twice a day for 21 days, and then switched to 20 mg daily thereafter, with compression stocking. One month after hospitalization, the patient was seen in the emergency department with persistent RLE pain. Repeat duplex US demonstrated chronic DVT involving the proximal and mid-femoral vein in addition to proximal popliteal veins. Given concern for anticoagulation failure and the presence of an anatomical vascular abnormality, the patient was referred to the vascular surgery for consideration of an interventional procedure. Patient was deemed not appropriate for any surgical intervention, given the high rate of morbidity and was recommended to continue on lifelong anticoagulation and management of chronic varicose veins with elastic compression stockings.\n\n【16】The patient was seen 2 months later in the medical clinic and was found to have resolution of symptoms and repeat lower extremity duplex US was negative for acute or chronic DVT bilaterally.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】IVC agenesis often is diagnosed in young patients presenting with unprovoked DVT and has been reported to be in association with kidney and IVC abnormalities with leg thrombosis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】During embryogenesis, the IVC derives from three separate segments of embryonic veins: posterior cardinal, subcardinal and supracardinal veins. If abnormal regression or persistence of this embryonic vein occurs, various abnormalities of the IVC can develop including complete absence, partial absence or presence of bilateral IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the absence of the infrarenal IVC, venous return from iliac veins will drain directly into the azygos and hemiazygos venous systems. Since the azygos and hemiazygos veins are considered low caliber, collaterals can develop to permit adequate venous outflow from lower extremities. If the collateral system fails despite compensatory enlargement, it can impede blood return, which can lead to increased risk for thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Patients that present with unprovoked DVTs require thorough investigation for underlying malignancy and thrombophilia disorders. Of note, screening tests for thrombophilia disorders can be impacted by anticoagulants and should be performed after discontinuing vitamin K antagonists for 2 weeks or direct oral anticoagulants for 2–3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. To date, there are limited reports on the clinical association of unprovoked DVT and IVC agenesis in otherwise healthy middle-aged adults. One of the largest reports is from Lambert _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> in which they reviewed 72 patients, 10 of which were their original patients, with IVC agenesis and DVT in an effort to document the clinical spectrum of disease. This study demonstrated that a majority of patients were young males (<40 years of age) who developed proximal DVT after intense physical exertion. They also reported that 35.4–60% of patients presented with bilateral DVT, whereas pulmonary embolism was present in 0.0–9.97% of patients. Thus, in young males with unprovoked DVT, it is recommended to rule out vascular abnormalities, particularly in those with proximal thrombosis with unclear etiology.\n\n【21】Limited evidence is available regarding the best treatment and duration for DVT secondary to IVC agenesis. However, most of the studies report good response with prolonged oral anticoagulation combined lifestyle modification, including leg elevation and compression stocking. There is evidence of DVT recurrence after anticoagulation discontinuation; therefore, lifelong anticoagulation should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of IVC agenesis in a middle-aged adult presenting with multiple unprovoked DVTs with poor medical compliance. We advocate for a thorough workup at initial presentation in patients with unprovoked DVTs and recommend lifelong anticoagulation therapy and routine follow-up in those found to have ICV agenesis to prevent recurrence as such in this patient.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors participated in the preparation and writing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained for the elaboration and publication of the article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>V.E.P. is the guarantor of submission.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Both diseases show a multifactorial origin with a complex interplay between genetic, environmental factors, and some components of the commensal microbiota. The coexistence of celiac disease with Crohn’s disease is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a case of a 13-year-old Syrian male who presented with a history of abdominal pain, anorexia and pallor. CeD and Crohn’s disease was documented on gastrointestinal endoscopy and histological study. The patient was treated with a gluten-free, low fiber, high caloric diet, and a course of oral corticosteroids with an improvement in growth rate and abdominal pain.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Celiac disease (CeD) is a genetically determined chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine. It occurs in about 1% of the population worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of CeD is multifactorial but is mainly defined by the presence of 3 factors: genetic changes, exposure to gluten and an altered immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis, type I diabetes, Addison’s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The prevalence of IBD in CeD is estimated to be (1–3.2)% that is 通用删除7(英):<u>(3–10)</u> times higher than the prevalence of IBD in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Compared to adults, the coexistence of CeD with CD in children is extremely rare. To our knowledge, no more than 30 cases of CeD with CD in children have been reported in the literature, most of them were more than 12 years old.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 13-year-old Syrian male presented to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of epigastric and peri-umbilical abdominal pain for 3 years, which were exacerbated by food and partly controlled with analgesics. The episodes were associated with anorexia and pallor. There was no significant past medical or family history. During that period, the child was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia \\[hemoglobin (Hb) 8.9 g/dl, Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 69 fl\\] with no response to iron supplemental therapy. Anti-gliadin antibodies IgA, IgG (AGA IgA, IgG), Anti-tissue transglutaminase Antibodies IgA (anti-TTG IgA) were markedly elevated (more than 100 U/mL). An Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) had been performed a year pirior to admission, with normal findings, and the duodenal biopsies had shown CeD type 3a according to the Marsh classification (partially atrophic villi with lymphocytic exocytosis at 56 lymphocytes/100 enterocytes in the lamina properia) . The patient was treated with a gluten-free diet without improvement in abdominal pain.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Compatible with grade (3a) on the Marsh grading system for CD classification.</u>\n\n【7】On physical examination, his body weight was 23 kg (SD –4) and his height was 137 cm (SD –2). He was pale, but his observations were stable and he appeared generally well. The patient underwent multiple investigations that showed hypochromic microcytic anemia \\[Hb 8.6 g/dl, MCV 68 fl\\] associated with an inflammatory respond \\[C- reactive protein (CRP) 81 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 40 mm at the end of 1 <sup>st </sup> hour\\] and hypoalbuminemia (Alb 3,2 g/dl). AGA (IgA, IgG) and anti-TTG IgA were within the normal range on this admission. Investigations including hepatic and renal function, blood glucose, urinary investigations and an abdominal ultrasound were all normal. Therefore, an EGD was repeated showing diffuse scattered nonbleeding ulcers, covered with fibrinous membranes in the esophagus, antrum, and duodenum. Histological examination of stomach biopsies showed chronic active ulcerated gastritis with diffuse lymphocytic infiltration in the lamina properia and stomach abscesses . Duodenal biopsies showed uncertain chronic duodenal mucosa inflammation. The ileocolonoscopy showed regions of congestive mucosa in the rectum, colon, caecum, and ileum with longitudinal ulcers alternating with healthy mucosa . Histological study of colonic and ileal biopsies showed focal erosions, crypitis, crypt abscesses with fissures, and non-caseating granulomas which correlates with active Crohn’s disease .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Microscopic image: stomach abcesses.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Longitudinal ulcers alternating with healthy mucosa.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Histological ileal biopsies: small histiocytes aggregates.</u>\n\n【11】The patient was treated with a gluten-free, low fiber, high caloric diet, and a course of oral corticosteroid (Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) with progressive tapering after 3 weeks.\n\n【12】After about one month of initiation treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement. His symptoms improved markedly, and he gained 3 kg in weight. We then added 5-aminosalicylic acid (Mesalamine) 25 mg/kg/day, vitamins, and iron supplements.\n\n【13】We followed the patient for 3 years after initial treatment. During these years, the steroid was gradually reduced until it was discontinued after 6 months of treatment at full dose. Currently, the patient is treated with a gluten-free, low fiber, high caloric diet, mesalamine 25 mg/kg/day and vitamins. His CD remains in remission and he now has a normal growth rate with normal pubertal development.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The first report on the occurrence of CeD and CD in the same patient was in 1967 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The underlying coexisting mechanism of the two diseases is still controversial. Both are genetically predisposed diseases that share a similar immune-mediated Th1 inflammatory cascade response to the loss of tolerance to external antigens (gluten for CeD and intestinal flora to CD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Symptoms of malabsorption, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and long-standing history of iron deficiency anaemia are common in both CD and CeD, which can present a challenge in distinguishing between the two conditions. Biochemical changes would also be similar and therefore not very helpful in making the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Malabsorption and anaemia in celiac patients that have no response to treatment are investigated for possible IBD as the 2 conditions may coexist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Several patients with CD and CeD are seronegative for AGA, anti-endomysium antibodies, and anti-TTG IgA particularly patients showing slight/moderate histological damage of duodenum (Marsh II-IIIa lesions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the serological tests for CeD were positive, although the patient had Marsh IIIa lesions.\n\n【16】Although interestingly, there is some overlap. A toothcomb appearance in the duodenum is one of the most characteristic endoscopic and histological findings in CD, and it can also be present in CeD, with villous atrophy seen in up to 20% of patients with CeD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In our case, the dominant symptom in our patient was chronic abdominal pain for the last three years, resulting in malnutrition, serious weight loss, and anaemia without any response to appropriate therapy. Colonoscopy examination was performed, which revealed the coexistence of CeD and CD. The patient was treated with improvement in abdominal pain, weight, and anaemia.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】Co-existent disease should be kept in mind when the diagnosis is not clear or the patient is not improving on appropriate therapy. Paediatricians must consider the investigation of CD in patients with CeD, who have poor control of symptoms despite receiving adequate diet.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer, doctors in Pediatric department and laboratory assistants in Tishreen Hospital laboratory.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO          PARTICIPATE\n---------------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images.

The treatment of choice of infected pregnant patients is amphotericin B, which is known to produce electrolyte imbalances. However, it infrequently causes severe, prolonged and profound hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

It is mostly obtained during outdoor activities, causing a primary lung infection, which in rare circumstances can disseminate to the skin, bones and the genitourinary system. The initial presentation of pulmonary blastomycosis is often mistaken for other infectious or non-infectious etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On very rare occasions, opportunistic fungal infections as the _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ can occur on pregnant women, which are partially immunosuppressed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for blastomycosis, which was initially diagnosed as an inflammatory or malignant process in a pregnant woman and treated with amphotericin, as this is the only approved drug in pregnancy.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【11】We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman, 24 weeks pregnant, who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and productive cough for the last 3 months requiring frequent outpatient medical assessments. She did not have any recent travel, but she lives in Chicago. Physical examination revealed right basal crackles, but it was otherwise unremarkable. Initial workup revealed mild elevation of WBC at 11.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl along with an unremarkable chest X-ray. Patient declined computed tomography (CT) chest due to concerns of radiation exposure and was discharged on oral antibiotics. Three weeks later, she developed worsening respiratory symptoms and basic blood work showed a WBC of 12 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> , she declined chest CT again and was sent on oral antibiotics. One month later, she was admitted at our hospital with hemoptysis and severe dyspnea, chest X-ray showed a large right upper lobe airspace opacity, subsequent chest CT showed a mass like consolidation on the right upper lobe measuring up to 9 cm in diameter and an additional mass of 2.2 cm in diameter in the left lower lobe. Findings were concerning for neoplasm with a multifocal infectious process also considered in the differential given appearance . She underwent an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the lung mass that showed pyogranulomatous inflammation with silver stain highlighting broad base budding yeast . Subsequent biopsy cultures were positive for Blastomyces dermatitidis and Blastomyces antigens in urine were positive, with values of 1.73 ng/ml.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest CT angiography revealing large confluent airspace opacity in the anterior right upper lobe abutting the chest wall and mediastinum (red arrow).

Her course was complicated by profound hypomagnesemia (0.6 mmol/l) and hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/l) despite aggressive IV and oral repletion along with high doses of amiloride (40 mg). Creatinine levels were within normal limits through her treatment. After finalizing her amphotericin regimen, electrolyte disturbances resolved, and the patient had a pregnancy to term without any abnormality on her newborn.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Blastomycosis is endemic to the midwestern, southeastern and south-central USA, with an incidence rate that can reach 2.88 hospitalizations per 100 000 persons-year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The incubation period ranges between 3 and 15 weeks. Women are affected less frequently than men and pregnancy seems to be even less frequent. A 20-year retrospective observational study was able to find only 19 cases in pregnant patients, the age of affected women ranged from 17 to 39 years with the medium duration of pregnancy being 26 weeks. When untreated vertical transmission of the disease was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The infection can range from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a wide variety of infiltrates seen on imaging studies. Given that pregnancy is considered a mildly immunosuppressed state, prompt diagnosis and treatment are warranted.\n\n【17】A combination of clinical suspicion and antigenic testing usually guides therapy. However, histology and cultures are the gold standard and may be required, given that Blastomyces antigenic testing has been shown to have cross reactivity with other fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Pulmonary blastomycosis has non-specific symptoms (fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, cough) and can present in an acute or chronic manner with different degrees of severity. The radiographic findings can be mistaken with pneumococcal pneumonia, tuberculosis and cancer, thus earning the title of the ‘great pretender’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. Delay in diagnosis has been related to multiple antibiotic courses, disseminated disease and increase in mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent several antibiotic regimens and had a 3-month delay in diagnosis that likely allowed progression of the primary infection leading to CT chest finding of a large mass suspicious of malignancy. It is of note that initial Blastomyces urine antigen levels were low, despite the presence a 9 cm mass on CT.\n\n【18】Current guidelines recommend treating blastomycosis on pregnant patients with AmB since azoles have been reported associated with teratogenicity in animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The length of treatment on severe disease goes between 6 and 12 months. Liposomal amphotericin is safer when compared to other formulations; however, nephrotoxicity and electrolyte imbalances remain a considerable side effect and are secondary to an increase in the permeability to cations in the distal renal tubules. This is reflected by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia noted during surveillance laboratory blood work and replaced with supplementation as needed. Even when hypokalemia is expected, severe and persistent hypomagnesemia is not usually seen with AmB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Our patient required a total of 2940 Meq of potassium and a 116 mg of magnesium before reaching stable serum levels. This replacement was required despite of supratherapeutic doses of amiloride.\n\n【19】After reviewing literature, we have found only one other case of a pregnant woman with pulmonary blastomycosis presenting as a primary lung malignancy by Austin et al. Also, we were unable to find a report on profound and prolonged hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia requiring aggressive repletion on this same population.
