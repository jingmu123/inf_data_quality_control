This research paper examines the case of an 18-month-old Syrian female who had been diagnosed with intussusception. The patient underwent laparotomy, and multiple small bowel polyps were found to act as the lead point. For this reason, small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Although PJS diagnosis was histopathologically confirmed, the patient had no pigmented lesions on the face, the lower lip or the buccal mucosa and neither had any history of hospitalization or family history of the disease. This case was examined and is reported in the present study because PJS is rarely present at this early age when significant medical history is lacking.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomatous polyps and pigmented macules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hamartomatous polyps are most commonly found in the small intestine but may also be seen in the stomach and colon. The average age for the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms is 13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and ~50% of patients will suffer from polyps complications—such as intussusception, obstruction and rectal bleeding—by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Common in more than 90% of affected individuals, mucocutaneous pigmented lesions tend to arise in infancy, occurring around the mouth, nostrils, perianal area, fingers and toes and may be the first signs of PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common symptom is recurrent colicky abdominal pain caused by transient intussusception or obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of PJS is assumed if any of the following criteria is met: (i) two or more PJS polyps; (ii) any number of PJS polyps and a history of PJS in a close relative; (iii) characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation in an individual with a history of PJS in a close relative; or (iv) any number of PJS polyps with characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 3 \\]</u>. The majority of individuals with PJS have been found to have genetic alterations in LKB1, and up to 25% of those diagnosed have _de novo_ STK11 mutations with no family history of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PJS is associated with a progressively increasing lifetime risk of developing malignancies—by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-month-old Syrian female baby was admitted to our hospital with complaints of acute abdominal pain, several episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting and red diarrhea. She had neither prior hospitalization nor any significant symptoms in her own medical history, and her family’s history for PJS was negative. On admission, her vital signs were normal, and physical examination did not reveal any peculiar pigmented lesions. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness, diminished bowel sounds and a possible palpable epigastric mass. Blood analysis indicated low hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g ̸dl (n:12 to16 g ̸dl), a mean cell volume of 63.2 F ̸L (N:72–100 F ̸L), but other initial laboratory results were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography, in turn, revealed typical ‘target and pseudo-kidney’ signs. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with small bowel intussusception . Consequently, laparotomy was performed, and surgical examination detected jejunal palpable masses in the intussusceptum. Enterotomy revealed multiple polyps on the mucosal surface , and small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Post-operative course was uneventful. Histopathologic study was conducted on the resected portion, which consisted of a 15-cm specimen from the small bowel containing more than 100 pedunculated polyps on mucosal surface ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm in diameter .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Small bowel intussusception.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Enterotomy.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Multiple polyps on the mucosal surface.</u>\n\n【9】Microscopic examination of polyps showed proliferation of papillary and glandular formations lined by hyperplastic epithelial cells. Stroma was rich in smooth muscle fiber arising from the muscularis mucosae and infiltrated with patchy mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate . Neither adenomatous change nor malignancy was observed after a thorough examination. On the basis of two or more PJS polyps, the diagnosis of PJS syndrome was confirmed.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Microscopic image; ( **b** ) microscopic image; ( **c** ) microscopic image.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】PJS is an autosomal dominant condition, which was first described by Peutz in 1921, and it was not until 1949 that Jeghers defined the relation between pigmented lesions and gastrointestinal polyposis, on the one hand, and an increased risk of carcinoma, on the other 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent laparotomy following clinical symptoms of intussusception—confirmed by ultrasonography, and PJS was diagnosed with the help of histopathologic evaluation of the excised bowel. Here we ought to mention that laparoscopy is increasingly the preferred approach for diagnosis and management of acute abdominal and can be performed safely for bowel resection and anastomosis. However, the procedure was not available in the hospital where the study was conducted. Gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps are characteristic of PJS, and they are most commonly found in the small intestine but can also be found in other intestinal or extraintestinal sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The median time to first presentation with polyps is about 11–13 years of age, and ~50% will have experienced intussusception, obstruction or rectal bleeding by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Although the association between PJS and intussusception is not uncommon, this complication is rarely presented as a first clue of PJS. What is peculiar about our patient is that she presented with intussusception at the age of 18 months as the first complication of PJS.\n\n【13】Mucocutaneous pigmentation is typically found in over 90% of PJS cases but fades with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.The phenotype varies considerably from diffuse, dark freckling over the face to light pigmentation in characteristic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical examination of our patient, however, did not reveal any pigmented lesions. PJS is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene (also called LKB1) located at 19p13.3, as it encodes a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a tumor suppressor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Mutations in this gene are detected in 50—90% of individuals with PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although PJS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, up to 25% of cases do not have any family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Similarly, our patient did not have history of PJS in a close relative, and thus her case should be categorized as sporadic PJS, especially given that the authors of this study lacked the means to conduct genetic testing of the case under examination.\n\n【14】PJS is associated with a significantly increased risk of both intestinal and extraintestinal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. It rises with age, by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinical guidelines for the surveillance and management of PJS-affected individuals have been established; upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy should be performed every 2–3 years, starting from late teens. Additionally, small bowel visualization should start at the age of 8–10 and should be repeated every 2–3 years. Other screening procedures include clinical examination and specific imaging to screen for lesions of the breast, female genital tract, testis and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, management and follow-up methods for PJS patients continue to be somewhat controversial.\n\n【15】In conclusion, intussusception may be the first lead for PJS regardless of age, family history or pigmentation.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors did not receive any funding to conduct this study.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been duly obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:17:13", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:19:22", "cost": 128.43}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:36", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:19:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:17:13"}

The syndrome frequently involves digestive system besides other visceral organs such as liver, lungs, thyroid gland, spleen and nervous system. We present a case of a 36-year-old female with Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus that involved skin and musculoskeletal system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The rare BRBNS (Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome) was first reported by Gascoyen in 1860 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is characterized by malformations in the venous system of the skin and visceral organs. These malformations could be severe enough to cause bleeding and death. The malformations inhabit the skin in 93% of cases manifesting as button-like bluish papules and the gastrointestinal tract in 76% of cases causing bleeding, iron-deficiency anaemia and further complications such as torsion and intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Symptoms can vary depending on the organ involved. Vascular lesions in the nervous system may cause infarctions and bleeding, while respiratory involvement may include hemoptysis. Only 200 cases of the same syndrome were reported so far. Cancerous lesions have not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Diagnosis is mainly clinically supported by different modalities. Depending on the patient’s presentation and suspicion, the CBC is used to look for anaemia and faecal occult blood could be used to look for bleeding digestive system lesions. Dark urine will necessitate a urine test as bladder lesions could be the cause. Other radiological diagnostics are obtained depending on the specific manifestation, and for instance, musculoskeletal complaints may indicate the need for a simple X-ray or an MRI, while gastrointestinal incidents may require a CT or an endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Histopathological findings include a vascular network of dilated tortuous blood-filled vessels, lined up with a single layer of endothelial cells, surrounded by a delicate connective tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】There is no curative treatment. Systemic steroids are used to control intestinal growth. Interferon-alpha is used to treat coagulopathies. Surgical interventions (Surgical excision) or electrocauterization and cryosurgery are only used to excise symptomatic lesions and for cosmetic considerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 36-year-old female nurse from a remote rural area in Syria without significant medical or family history presented to the Department of Dermatology of Damascus University with skin complaints of ‘deep blue pimples’ and rubbery consistency masses under her skin in different parts of the body.\n\n【9】As described by the patient, the lesions started appearing right after birth as pigmented papules disseminated on the back and extremities. The papules grew gradually to form nodules and small tumours that bleed easily when exposed to trauma. Nodules also erupted on mucous membranes and the ones on the tongue and tonsils were surgically removed due to dysphagia and discomfort they caused the patient. The lesions kept appearing until the patient reached 20 years of age. In addition to the papules, the patient noticed the appearance of soft masses of different sizes under the skin, some of which was tender.\n\n【10】Physical examination of the patient revealed a pigmented brown-blue patch on the back , several pigmented papules on the palms and soles , soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue  in addition to several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the right forearm  and back  that were tender to touch and not attached to the overlying skin.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A pigmented brown-blue patch on the back (8 mm × 7 mm).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.</u>\n\n【15】The patient did not suffer from any anaemia that was due to the CBC laboratory examination.\n\n【16】Apart from the scars of previous surgical excisions, the rest of the physical examination was normal including the lymph nodes, hair and nails.\n\n【17】Additionally, the patient reported musculoskeletal complaints of bone and joint pain for which an MRI was ordered only to disclose multiple tumours occupying the muscles of the forearm .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumors on the right forearm (8 cm × 4 cm).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the back (MAX: 8 × 3, MIN: 4 × 3).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 8|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin and eosin slide took from a biopsy from an excided papule.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 9|删除段之间换行|Showing the forearm MRI.</u>\n\n【23】At the age of 6, a biopsy was performed on one of the excised lesions by a dermatologist . Histological findings described by the pathologist were large dilated vessels in the lower dermis and the subcutaneous tissue accompanied by capillary vascular dilatations in the upper dermis. These findings of a cavernous vascular tumour combined with the overall presentation consider BRBNS, also previously referred to as Bean Syndrome.\n\n【24】The patient was offered cryosurgery or electrocauterization to remove bothersome lesions as she wishes.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】To differentiate this diagnosis from similar diseases and syndromes, we compared the specifications of our case with six other entities: Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis, Familial glomangiomatosis, Maffucci syndrome, Kaposi sarcoma and Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Absent at birth and developing during the first weeks of life, the Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis is characterized by multifocal tumours up to 20 mm in size that grows rapidly and regresses spontaneously without sequela when confined only to the skin. The tumours could form in the liver, lungs or nervous system, causing symptoms of obstructive jaundice, heart and lung failure, or intracerebral haemorrhage. The mortality rate is high in untreated individuals. Only large symptomatic lesions should be excised. Histopathology reveals endothelial cell hyperplasia in a lobular form, mast cells and a prominent basement membrane. Upon regression, lipofibromatous tissue is seen with mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our patient started developing skin lesions at birth which did not regress spontaneously, so the diagnosis of Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis was unlikely.\n\n【28】While being not congenital, Familial Glomangiomatosis manifests with hard (not rubbery) dark blue papules and nodules clustered in groups with less mucosal involvement. The lesions usually start in young children and are less likely to cause symptoms. Some patients report pain episodes elicited by menstruation and pregnancy. The biopsy findings could catch the diagnosis as they show venous malformation of glomus cells surrounding irregular veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The genetic syndrome of Maffuci generally shows a manifestation at the age of 4–5 years old with cartilage tumours and vascular anomalies including spindle cell endothelial tumours. The nodules are tender and asymmetric, localized more on the distal extremities. The hemangiomas could be superficial or deep. The probability for chondrosarcoma is possible around the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient’s age on symptom onset and that she was having central lesions on her trunk and in her oral cavity did not fit the classical picture of Maffuci syndrome.\n\n【30】In contrast to our patient who had several lesions, Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber presents with one large vascular nevus, mostly on the thigh, knee or leg, with overlying lymphatic bullae that could bleed after puberty. The syndrome also has bone and connective tissue hypertrophy with varicose veins that may or may not accompany deep venous anomalies. Doppler ultrasound is used to diagnose this syndrome along with MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】The nodular type of Kaposi Sarcoma can manifest in older males as lesions mainly on lower extremities and rarely on the face or torso. The lesions can be symmetric with accompanying lymphedema. Hyperkeratotic overlying skin can be seen with a chance of malignancy in the advanced lesions. The biopsy shows bland spindle cells forming slit-like spaces occupied by red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【33】Our case represents one of the rarest vascular syndromes where only skin, mucous membranes and musculoskeletal systems were involved. The importance of the biopsy is not to be forgotten in combination with the clinical assessment being put in the picture of the whole presentation, such as the age and the progression. Patient education and life-long follow-up are essential to detect probable more dangerous manifestations which might be life-threatening such as gastrointestinal and neurological manifestations.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no acknowledgements.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding resources.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was also taken from the Faculty of Medicine at Damascus University.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ayham Badran.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:18:09", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:18:16", "cost": 6.949}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:36", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:18:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:18:07"}

She received therapy with corticosteroids, IVIg and Eltrombopag, but her platelet level was fluctuating and was difficult to achieve a well sustained response. A transient leukocytosis was noted but resolved by Eltrombopag dose reduction. Her pregnancy was complicated with preeclampsia with severe features required a prompt delivery. Although recent evidence supports the safety and efficacy of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy, unreported risks may underlie its use during pregnancy.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Eltrombopag is one of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) that interacts with the transmembrane domain of the thrombopoietin receptor and triggers megakaryocytic growth and differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In total, over 80% of the treated patients were reported to have increase in platelets by day 15 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, its use during pregnancy is limited to case reports and case series, so cumulative evidence is necessary to safely administer Eltrombopag to pregnant women. Michel _et al._ reported a retrospective study of 15 patients (17 pregnancies) who received TPO-RAs for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in pregnancy, of which 10 pregnancies were administered Eltrombopag, and seven pregnancies Romiplostim 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Of these 17 pregnancies, eight pregnancies showed complete response, six showed partial response and three showed no response. No adverse events or thromboembolic events were reported in these pregnancies, thus TPO-RAs have been started to be used in pregnant women worldwide. However, the data are limited due to the retrospective nature of the study, and data from East Asian population is lacking.\n\n【5】We here report a case of pregnancy complicated with refractory ITP and chronic hypertension (CH) managed with Eltrombopag, which resulted in superimposed preeclampsia (SPE) requiring subsequent termination at 27 weeks of gestation. Although she was managed without blood transfusion or comorbidity during peripartum period, we had difficulty in controlling platelet count only with Eltrombopag during the peripartum period.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-years-old nulliparous Japanese woman was diagnosed with ITP at age 16; who showed poor response to corticosteroids, splenectomy and rituximab, was referred to the obstetrics department for prenatal counseling. Due to the low platelet count which fluctuated around 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, pregnancy was not recommended since severe maternal hemorrhage was highly anticipated. However, she soon conceived naturally, and chose induced abortion at 11 weeks of gestation. At age 32, she again conceived naturally with platelet count of 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, but she was determined to continue her pregnancy despite of previously discussed risks. After consultation with hematologists, 10 mg of prednisolone was started at 8 weeks of gestation, but her platelet count showed no increase from 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was initiated at 10 weeks of gestation to confirm its effect, and it gradually increased from day 2, and reached the peak of 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 7, but decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 14. Although corticosteroids were ineffective, IVIg therapy showed temporal effect and it was repeated twice in 13th and 16th week of gestation as her platelet count again decreased to 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Since her platelet count showed no increase with steroids, and required repetitive administration of IVIg, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18 weeks of gestation with discontinuance of prednisolone. Platelets increased to 160 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in 14 days, but white blood cell count (WBC) also increased to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23 + 0 weeks of gestation. Consequently, her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus the dosage was increased to 25 mg again at 26 + 0 weeks of gestation .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The patient was administered corticosteroids and three times of immunoglobulin therapy in the first and second trimester. Eltrombopag 25mg/day was initiated from 18th week of gestation with discontinuance of corticosteroids. Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5mg/day from 23rd week of gestation, but it resulted in the decrease in platelets, thus it was increased again to 25mg/day at 26th week of gestation. Immunoglobulin therapy was combined to Eltrombopag after admission due to SPE, which resulted in rapid increase in the platelet count. PLT: platelet count, PSL: corticosteroid.</u>\n\n【9】Upon her maternal checkup at 12 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 147/96 and she was diagnosed as CH and was given 750 mg/day of oral methyldopa, but we refrained from starting low dose aspirin due to its antiplatelet effect. We increased methyldopa to 1500 mg at 25 + 4 weeks of gestation since her blood pressure increased to 145/95 mmHg. However, hypertension deteriorated to 200/110 mmHg and she complained of headache at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with SPE with urine protein of 1010 mg/day and was hospitalized. Intravenous nicardipine was initiated with 2 mg/h and magnesium sulfate with 1 g/h, and her blood pressure was controlled below 140/90 mmHg, and her headache resolved. Two betamethasone injections of 12 mg were given 24 h apart to prepare for delivery. Platelet count was still 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation and IVIg was started to prepare for the deterioration of SPE which may require prompt termination. At 27 + 3 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 169/100 even after administration of nicardipine 3 mg/h, and she also showed pulmonary edema with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 90% and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 57.7 mmHg . Therefore, caesarian section was decided due to maternal pulmonary edema from SPE and her platelet count was 130 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> / μl before the surgery. The surgery took 1 h and 9 min with blood loss of 1400 ml. A female neonate weighed 714 g with Apgar score of 4/8 (1 min and 5 min, respectively) and her platelet count was 68 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at birth. As the neonate’s platelet count dropped to 33 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl within 8 h, IVIg (400 mg/kg/day) was initiated and the platelets were maintained over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The patient developed pulmonary edema due to SPE. The chest X-ray shows butterfly pulmonary opacities with dull cardiopulmonary angles.</u>\n\n【11】After surgery, her platelet count was consistently over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl and she was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks after delivery. Upon her visit at 6 weeks after delivery, she was still on 12.5 mg/day of Eltrombopag with platelet count of 23 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. The platelet count of the infant was constantly over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl with no transfusion or medication and was discharged 144 days after birth without any comorbidity.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】ITP can occur during any trimester, and preexisting ITP can deteriorate during pregnancy. There is no concrete consensus on the management of ITP during pregnancy, but it is generally recommended to maintain the platelet count over 30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In the present case, her platelet count was 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in the first trimester. We confirmed that she was responsive to IVIg in the first trimester, but since she was not responsive to steroids, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18th week of gestation. However, the dosage was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23rd week of gestation due to the unusual increase in WBC, which again required increase to 25 mg/day at 26th week of gestation, since her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Adequate control of her platelet count could not be achieved only with Eltrombopag, thus we added IVIg therapy to control her platelet count after the onset of SPE.\n\n【14】When treatment is indicated against ITP, corticosteroid is chosen as an initial therapy and IVIg therapy is generally chosen to raise the platelet count in preparation for delivery in patients refractory to steroids. On the other hand, other treatment options chosen in non-pregnant patients are not recommended during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. However, recent studies suggest the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs during pregnancy and has shed light on the poor responders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. According to the United States Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), the initial dose is 50 mg/day, but East Asians are recommended to reduce the initial dose to 25 mg/day, since plasma Eltrombopag concentration was 50–55% higher in East Asian population as compared to non-East Asians, thus our initial dosage was 25 mg/day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In fact, the present case required reduction from 25 mg/day to 12.5 mg/day due to the unusual increase in WBC to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. As some studies have reported that TPO-RAs may increase the risk of myeloid fibrosis, we decreased the dosage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Although there has been no report of leukocytosis in previous pregnant ITP cases, not only platelets but also WBC should be carefully monitored during Eltrombopag use especially in East Asian population.\n\n【15】Eltrombopag had been assigned to ‘category C’ by the FDA in pregnancy, since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Eltrombopag use in pregnancy. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, there was evidence of embryo lethality and reduced fetal weights at maternally toxic doses. Thus, Eltrombopag should be used only when benefit outweighs its risk during pregnancy after thorough discussion with the patient. In our case, due to the uncertainty of the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy, we did not recommend its use during pregnancy especially in the first trimester, but since she wished to continue her pregnancy, it was started from the second trimester after thorough discussion with the patient.\n\n【16】Preconception counseling is the pivotal first step in the management of ITP patients who wish to conceive. Considering the high prevalence of SPE in CH patients of up to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and possible deterioration of thrombocytopenia with SPE, patients with CH and ITP require thorough preconception counseling to share the obstetrical risks with the health care provider. As for prenatal management, in patients refractory to corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to use Eltrombopag to increase platelet count starting from the second trimester after thorough counseling. This case failed in acquiring adequate control of the platelet count only with Eltrombopag, and severe leukocytosis and early onset of SPE occurred, although the relation between SPE and Eltrombopag is unclear. Informing the possibility of these previously unknown risks of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy to the patient prior to conception may be necessary in patients with ITP and CH who require Eltrombopag use, especially in East Asian population.\n\n【17】This is the first case report of an East Asian woman with ITP and CH who used Eltrombopag to maintain her platelet count during pregnancy. She developed SPE at 27 weeks of gestation requiring prompt termination of pregnancy, and she required IVIg along with Eltrombopag to raise her platelet count for caesarian section. Controlling platelet count with Eltrombopag seems reasonable when other options are unavailable during pregnancy, but its dosage should be controlled with monitoring of WBC as well, especially in East Asian population. Well-controlled study to validate the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy is waited.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The design of this work has been approved by the University of Tokyo ethical committee.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Seisuke Sayama.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:51:44", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:51:58", "cost": 13.91}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:36", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:51:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:51:44"}

Two years later, the mass reappeared with the same characteristics. An X-ray of the newly appeared lesion was taken . Physical examination revealed a deformed nail plate and a hyperkeratotic mass of 0.9 cm in diameter, with regular borders, and mild erythema that was protruding from underneath . On palpation, the mass was indurated, firm and tender. Pinch sign was negative. A left foot radiograph in the oblique projection revealed a pedunculated radiopaque mass emerging from the terminal end of the distal phalanx.

She had stopped visiting an outpatient clinic because the adenoma, though enlarging, was asymptomatic. Three days after onset of an upper respiratory tract infection, she developed stridor and difficulty breathing and had a cardiopulmonary arrest. Chest compressions and manual bag ventilation were immediately initiated by in-house nurses, restoring spontaneous circulation. On admission to a hospital, she was found to have a huge elastic mass in her oropharyngeal space . A Cormack grade 3 view was achieved on direct laryngoscopy by an experienced emergency physician; however, endotracheal intubation was not successful. Repeat laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope (Airway Scope®, Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) provided a Cormack grade 1 view, enabling intubation of her trachea with a 7.0-mm endotracheal tube. Computed tomography scan revealed a homogeneous mass (5.4 × 5.0 × 3.5 cm) compressing the oropharyngeal space . After undergoing a tracheostomy, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital with no neurological sequelae.

This causes venous stasis and increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Typically, patients with absent IVCs present before 30 years of age, with bilateral DVT symptoms triggered by intense exercise. The abnormality can remain undetected as computed tomography imaging is not usually performed. Due to the increased risk of clotting, these patients should be on life-long anticoagulation. Raising clinical awareness of this condition, to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment, is important.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Abnormally developed inferior vena cavae (IVCs) affect ~4% of the population, including variants such as agenesis, hypoplasia, duplication and interruption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Such anomalies can be isolated or accompanied by other congenital abnormalities, e.g. polysplenia, asplenia and dextrocardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The agenesis or absence of an IVC is rare, prevalence estimated 0.0005–1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Causes include embryological malformation and perinatal IVC thrombosis causing blockage and subsequent regression of the IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】An absent IVC necessitates collateral vessel formation to drain the abdominal organs and peripheries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These inefficient vessels increase the patient’s risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) venous stasis and ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8–12 \\]</u>. Identification of these patients is important to help reduce their risk of adverse thrombotic events.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 24-year-old man presented to hospital with leg and hip pain, commencing during high-intensity interval training, an activity he regularly undertook. The pain originated in his right leg, spreading to the left and both hips. Additionally, he reported 1 day history of dyspnoea worse on exertion and associated dizziness. He denied symptoms of cough, fever, haemoptysis or pleuritic chest pain. He reported intentional weight loss of 3.5 stone over 1 year.\n\n【8】His past medical history comprised of asthma. He took no regular medications and didn’t smoke. There was no reported family history. He works as a financial manager.\n\n【9】Clinical observations were heart rate 103, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 126/69 and oxygen saturations 100% on room air. Heart sounds were normal and chest was clear. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. His right calf was swollen compared with the left and tender on palpation. Coordination, power and sensation of both legs were intact.\n\n【10】An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm and no cardiovascular strain . A chest X-ray demonstrated an azygous fissure. Ultrasound of the right leg demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the great saphenous vein, from the right sapheno-femoral junction to the popliteal vein. Ultrasound of the left leg revealed a thrombus extending from the left common femoral vein into the popliteal vein. A handheld echocardiogram exhibited no right heart strain, and lab-measured troponin was 2.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Patient’s admission ECG.</u>\n\n【12】A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram and thorax–abdomen–pelvis showed extensive bilateral PEs . There was no saddle embolus or radiological evidence of right heart strain. Prominent femoral and internal iliac veins were seen . Clots were seen in both iliac veins and distal IVC. There was no IVC visible above the level of the renal veins . The proximal IVC was patent, with venous collateralization in the retroperitoneum, suggesting a chronic diagnosis. Abdominal venous drainage was predominantly via the azygos and hemi-azygos system.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|CTPA revealing pulmonary embolus within the right lung, labelled as filling defect.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|CTPA revealing pulmonary embolus within the left lung, labelled as filling defect.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Sagittal CT image demonstrating the presence of the IVC.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Sagittal CT image demonstrating an absent IVC.</u>\n\n【17】A thrombosis screen including; paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, thrombophila screen, anti-nuclear antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies, beta-2-glycoprotein level, anticardiolipin levels, Hep B&C, human immunodeficiency virus screen and JAK-2 mutation screening was negative.\n\n【18】The gentleman was initially administered treatment-dose tinzaparin pending vascular MDT. Mechanical thrombectomy was considered but deemed not in his best interest due to the high risk of venous re-occlusion in the presence of persisting venous outflow obstruction. Lifelong anticoagulation was recommended. Given his haemodynamic stability throughout admission thrombolysis was deemed unnecessary. Anticoagulation with rivaroxaban caused rectal bleeding and he was switched to apixaban, which has been well tolerated. He remains asymptomatic at 1-year post-diagnosis, under follow-up from the haematology team.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】The IVC is made up of four parts, the hepatic, supra-renal, renal and infra-renal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The phrase ‘absent IVC’ refers to an absence of all sections, or an absence of one or combinations of sections, with the mechanism best understood by looking at the embryological formation of the venous system. In utero, the vessels below the liver are formed by three pairs of veins, the subcardinal, posterior cardinal and supracardinal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. An absence of the entire IVC requires the incorrect formation of all three pairs. As the probability of this occurring as a systematic embryological error is unlikely, it is possible that an absent IVC without other congenital abnormalities may not be truly congenital, but rather pathological 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】An absent IVC could be due to perinatal thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. One case describes a girl presenting with symptoms, and a consequent diagnosis of DVT within 48 hours of her birth, and no discernable IVC on ultrasound at that time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. When rescanned aged 12, a thrombosed IVC with partial refilling was seen, suggesting a hypoplastic IVC. Another potential cause of absent IVCs is renal thrombosis, a phenomenon encountered in unwell infants and has been shown to accompany IVC thrombosis and regression of the infra-renal IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 17 \\]</u>. The terminology ‘absent IVC’ could therefore be a misnomer, with ‘hypoplasia’ being potentially more appropriate.\n\n【22】While hypoplasia of an infra-renal IVC is a rare but well-documented anomaly, the CT in this case demonstrates a normal infra-renal IVC with a hypoplastic suprarenal IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>.

The mechanism for DVT is peripheral venous stasis, rather than blood hypercoagulability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. PEs are secondary to clot formation within the collateral veins that travel through the heart to the lungs.\n\n【24】There were 62 documented cases of abnormal IVC presenting with DVT as of 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Approximately 5% of patients presenting with unprovoked DVT under the age of 30 were found to have IVC abnormalities, indicating that it is a significant risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Intense exercise is a trigger for DVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In our patient, we postulate that the congenital IVC abnormality was the major risk factor, but that the intense exercise could have contributed to the extent of the clot.\n\n【25】Current NICE guidelines do not require a CT for patients with DVT unless there is concern of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Without a CT, patients with absent IVCs as the cause of their DVT may go undetected. Due to the increased thrombotic risk, patients under the age of 30 with symptoms of bilateral DVT provoked by exercise must therefore be considered for imaging to investigate abnormal IVC development.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Jonathan Barber and Dr Philip Marjoram.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was required for this case report.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained from the patient in regards to writing the case study, and data was anonymized.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:39:19", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:39:53", "cost": 34.087}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:36", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:39:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:39:19"}

It is the most common cause of chronic blood loss and anemia; however, severe massive hematemesis is an uncommon condition. Herein, we present a case of severe massive hematemesis with melena stool in a six-month-old boy with cow’s milk protein intolerance. In this case, we described management used in poor developing countries.\n\n【2】Cow’s milk protein intolerance (CMPI) , massive hematemesis , melena stool\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Cow’s milk protein intolerance (CMPI) is the most common food allergy in young children affecting approximately (1.9–4.9)% of children under four years of age with a peak in the first year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is associated with several distinct entities such as IgE-mediated CMPI, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis, food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), Heiner syndrome, and even may be related to infantile colic, GERD disease, and constipation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. CMPI may present as vomiting, chronic diarrhea sometimes containing blood and mucus, hematemesis, urticaria, colicky abdominal pain. Severe massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to CMPI may be considered a rare symptom among infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A six-month-old boy with no significant medical and family history presented to our emergency department (ED) with hematemesis and passage of melena stool. The emesis was bright red; five times in the preceding 24 hours; with passed dark melena stool four times. The stool was soft without mucus, abdominal discomfort or pain. He was on formula since the age of 5 months. He was not taking any medications. His blood pressure was 90/53 mmHg, with a heart rate of 130/min and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. He had normal growth (weight 6.1 kg, length 68 cm) with a normal physical examination except pallor. Laboratory findings revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia \\[Hb 6.5 g/dl, MCV 71 fl\\] with normal prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).\n\n【7】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), liver function tests, kidney function tests, electrolytes and immunoglobulin E (IgE) were normal. Peripheral blood smear showed erythrocytes of different sizes, shapes and lack of pigment with normal leukocytes, eosinophil and platelets. Stool microscopy revealed 通用删除7(英):<u>(20–30)</u> white blood cells with 通用删除7(英):<u>(4–6)</u> red blood cells. The abdominal ultrasound was normal. The child was placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) with a transfusion of 15 mL/kg of red blood. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed severe gastric mucosa edema with fragility and bleeding tendency. There was widespread edema in the duodenum and duodenum bulb . The histological biopsies showed advanced villous atrophy associated with marked lymph-plasmacytic infiltration and an increase of eosinophils more than 25/HPF in the duodenum . Gastric biopsy showed chronic gastritis with mild activity . According to the clinical, laboratory and histological findings, CMPI was diagnosed. Due to the poor economic conditions of the family and the lack of amino acid, soy protein formulas in our country, the child was placed on goat milk (GM) (1/2 GM expanded with 1/2 water) plus multivitamins (especially folate, B12, B6, A, C and D) with restricted cow’s products. After treatment, the child’s general condition improved and vomiting stopped, and he was discharged after 3 days. During 4-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with normal weight gain. He is well until now and still on restricted cow’s products and GM without any complaint.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed severe gastric mucosa edema with fragility and bleeding tendency.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|The histological biopsies from the duodenum showed advanced villous atrophy associated with marked lymph-plasmacytic infiltration and an increase of eosinophils more than 25/HPF.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Gastric biopsy showed chronic gastritis with mild activity.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Acute massive bleeding in children is associated with many surgical conditions as midgut volvulus, intussusception or other surgical diseases. These causes are distinguished across laboratory tests and radiological examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Laboratory investigations in CMPI infants are not diagnostic but can support a diagnosis. It may demonstrate microcytic anemia, eosinophilia, mildly elevated serum IgE, decreased albumin, increased platelets, ESR, CRP and fecal leukocytes that are all evidence of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our case presented severe massive hematemesis with melena stool that required laboratory and radiological examinations to exclude surgical diseases. Laboratory data showed normal leukocytes, eosinophil and IgE with hypochromic microcytic anemia and increased fecal leukocytes that suggested CMPI.\n\n【13】CMPI is difficult to diagnosis, the gold standard for diagnosis is the strict avoidance of cow’s milk protein from the infant’s and mother’s diet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. EGD examination may appear multiple superficial erosions, ulcerations, lymphoid nodular hyperplasia or focal erythema. Histological findings include focal infiltrates of eosinophils of more than15–20 eosinophils/HPF in all mucosal layers, crypt atrophy or it may be normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, EGD appeared severe gastric mucosa edema with widespread edema in the duodenum and duodenum bulb. The histological biopsies showed advanced villous atrophy associated with a marked increase of eosinophil more than 25/HPF in the duodenum. Elimination of cow’s milk protein from the infant’s resulted in a significant improvement in the symptoms observed (massive hematemesis and melena stool). Infants with CMPI should avoid all food containing cow’s milk. Infants who are fed formula should be given an extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHFs), soy protein formula or amino acid -based formulas (AAFs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The European Society for Pediatrics Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommend that an AAFs may be considered as the first choice. Soy protein-based formula may be an option in infants older than 6 months. It has a significant risk of crossreactivity of ~ 通用删除7(英):<u>(30–50)</u>% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. GM is not suitable for infants under 12 months of age. There is high cross-reactivity (~30%) between GM and cow’s milk described in the literature that makes GM prohibited in CMPI. Little cases are known about tolerance to GM in patients with CMPI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. If it is necessary to use GM in newborns, we may avoid the main hazards by using the following guidelines. Firstly, raw GM should be boiled. Secondly, GM should be diluted in half to three-quarter strength because of its high solute content. Thirdly, the supplement folic acid and vitamins B12, A, C and D are needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Due to poor financial conditions and the lack of alternatives to cow’s milk (soy milk, EHFs, AAFs), GM was used as an experimental treatment with good patient tolerance.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIAL\n---------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have read and approved the manuscript.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer, doctors in the Pediatric department, and laboratory assistants in the Tishreen Hospital laboratory.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>COMPETING INTERESTS\n-------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DECLARATIONS\n------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>### ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee Tishreen university hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images.

There was a drop in acute coronary syndrome admission rates worldwide as collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were reluctant to seek appropriate care. We presented a 47-year-old woman with acute heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. She had a history of typical prolonged chest pain 2 weeks before but no coronary risk factors.

Although the lungs are the primary organ affected by COVID-19, several reports have shown that the cardiovascular system can be involved in the setting of this disease through various mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement, the pandemic has also impacted general cardiovascular care through reduced availability of healthcare services for non-COVID-19 work and reluctance of patients to seek prompt medical attention for fear of infection. Indeed, a substantial reduction in patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes has been noted during the pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of a neglected myocardial infarction in a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the hospital with heart failure and concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\nA 47-year old lady presented acutely with a 2-week history of worsening dyspnea. The patient had no previous cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing conditions. She had obtained a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as part of her insurance company’s workup 6 months prior, which was normal. She described prolonged chest pain at rest 2 weeks before admission. The chest pain was retrosternal radiating to the jaw and the left arm, worsened with physical effort and was accompanied by perspiration. The patient avoided seeking hospital treatment for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In the physical exam, she had bilateral coarse crackles in both lungs. ECG on admission showed Q wave and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3 and inverted T wave in leads aVL and V2–V4 . Lung Computed tomography (CT) on admission showed bilateral consolidation and ground-glass appearance with bilateral pleural effusion . The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Blood work demonstrated leucocytosis 19 |$\\\\times$| 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> , lymphopenia 965/mm <sup>3 </sup> and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) 16.7 mg/dl (normal < 1 mg/dl) and procalcitonin 0.08 ng/ml (normal: 0.05 ng/ml), N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly elevated at 21517 pg/ml according to recommended cut-off values > 450 pg/mL in patients less than 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. troponin I was not raised (<0.2 ng/ml). Focused echocardiography in the intensive care unit revealed severely reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic (C-ANCA, P-ANCA), lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. She received medical therapy with the diagnosis of acute heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia, including metoprolol, lisinopril and aspirin, clopidogrel. Coronary angiography showed no flow-limiting epicardial coronary artery disease . During the 3 weeks following her discharge, she experienced fatigue and exertional dyspnea in her ordinary physical activity, New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) II. Her dyspnea improved after that, and she has been reclassified to NYHA classification I. Since the coronary arteries were normal, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was scheduled to rule out any possible non-ischemic cause of myocardial injury, such as myocarditis or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The CMR was performed 3-month post-recovery and revealed enlarged LV volume (end-diastole 120 cc/m <sup>2 </sup> ), severely reduced ejection fraction of 30% and akinesia in the anterior and mid to apical septal wall. There was also subendocardial near transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) consistent with near transmural infarction in the left anterior descending territory (LAD) .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) ECG showed Q wave and ST-segment elevation V1-V3 and inverted T in leads aVL and V2-V4.

The CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacity with bilateral consolidation as well as bilateral pleural effusion, which can be seen in both acute pulmonary oedema and COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pattern of lung involvement presented in our patient are also among the CT features mostly reported during 12–17 days of COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, so we assume the onset of COVID-19 must have preceded with the onset of chest pain. According to lung CT imaging features, it was difficult to distinguish the proportion of viral lung damage from acute pulmonary edema since both can appear as extensive ground-glass appearance and thickened interlobular septa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The laboratory data, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated CRP and procalcitonin are all consistent with the COVID-19 inflammatory phase. Troponin was negative as expected, as we assume it must have returned to baseline because the acute phase of chest pain occurred 2 weeks earlier. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly elevated in line with acute pulmonary edema. We believe the lung has been affected by both acute pulmonary edema and viral pneumonia regarding available laboratory and imaging tests. The coronary arteries were without any atherosclerotic lesion in angiography. Although CMR was not performed during the acute phase of our patient’s disease, the presence of extensive subendocardial scar in the myocardium ruled out any non-ischemic cause of myocardial injury, such as a previous episode of myocarditis, which typically manifested with subepicardial and/or midwall fibrosis, or other pathologies such as non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Takotsubo was also ruled out as a possible cause of myocardial injury, as no significant infarction or fibrosis is apparent on CMR in this condition, and ventricular function typically recovers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, based on the clinical scenario, lung and cardiac imaging, and laboratory findings, we decided that the patient’s ultimate diagnosis is myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries, which can be classified as myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary artery (MINOCA).\n\n【9】Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 may act through multiple disease mechanisms, including non-ischemic myocardial injuries such as myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and ischemic myocardial damage, all can be seen in the acute and recovery phase of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. Patients who present with evidence of myocardial infarction without signs of obstructive coronary artery disease are categorized as MINOCA. Plaque disruption, coronary artery spasm, thromboembolism, coronary dissection, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other forms of type 2 myocardial infarction are the most common causes. CMR is the reference standard non-invasive modality for myocardial tissue characterization and can differentiate myocardial injury’s ischemic and non-ischemic patterns. CMR’s ability to detect and localize fibrosis caused by prior myocarditis or other non-ischemic cardiomyopathies aids in determining the etiology of myocardial injury and distinguishing the phenotypes of cardiomyopathy in a large number of people. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> Thus, the CMR is a key modality in MINOCA patients as it elucidates potential causes of myocardial damage and confirms the diagnosis of myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Ischaemic myocardial injury in the setting of COVID-19 infection may be driven by exacerbation of the pre-existing disease, destabilization of stable plaques or thrombotic and embolic phenomenon, along with endothelial dysfunction and microangiopathy. A direct viral effect or immune-mediated endothelium damage and microvascular inflammation can cause infarction and have been hypothesized as one mechanism by which COVID-19 individuals can have end-organ damage in the heart, brain and lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In our patient, we believe that the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection may predispose endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, leading to infarction, which can occur even in the absence of pre-existing disease or coronary risk factors in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【11】Due to the patient’s delayed presentation, we can’t be certain about infection onset. However, the mixed pattern presented in the CT of our patient, ground-glass opacities and bilateral consolidations are among CT features that were commonly reported in week three of COVID-19 illness, so we assume the onset of COVID-19 infection must have been earlier than the onset of chest pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. On the other hand, our patient was in a heart failure state, and the congestion can affect the CT features. It is, of course, also possible that, in this case, the acute myocardial infarction preceded COVID-19. This highlights an equally, if not more important, issue for cardiologists regarding poorer cardiovascular outcomes due to delay in seeking medical assistance for acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most cases reported in children were found to have unsuppressed viral loads and low CD4 counts. Although the aetiology of the disease is largely unknown, a few studies have postulated cytokine imbalance and immune activation as possible causes. Intimal staining of the involved cerebral arteries have revealed transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-gp 41. We present the case of an 18-year-old boy with congenitally acquired HIV-1 who presented with right hemiparesis at the age of 12 years and was found to have Moyamoya disease on neuroimaging. His CD4 count has always been low (<100 cells/cumm) in spite of being virally suppressed. He was started on anti-retroviral therapy at 5 and half years of age and he was continued on the same. He was treated conservatively and he continues to have residual right hemiparesis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Moyamoya disease has been seen in patients with long-standing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) now that survival has improved with good adherence to medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A few cases have been reported in children, in both controlled and uncontrolled HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–4 \\]</u>. We present the case of an 18-year-old adolescent with congenitally acquired HIV with moyamoya disease who first presented with a stroke at the age of 12 years.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-year-old boy with congenitally transmitted HIV-1 was diagnosed and started on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) at the age of 5 and half years with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. One month later, he was diagnosed to have abdominal tuberculosis and was given 6 months of anti-tuberculosis therapy. He also has a past history of varicella at the age of 2 and half years. His ART regime was later substituted to abacavir, lamivudine and nevirapine due to the phasing out of stavudine at the age of 9 years, and it was later changed to tenofovir, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir at 12 years due to suspected immunological failure. Lopinavir/ritonavir was later substituted to dolutegravir. He has been virally suppressed all throughout. However, his CD4 count has always been <100 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> in spite of being virally suppressed. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis has been given all throughout. No other opportunistic infections were seen.\n\n【6】At 12 years of age, he developed right hemiparesis with right-sided choreiform movements. Aspirin was started and the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal/fusiform aneurismal dilatation/ectasia predominantly along the left lateral aspect of the basilar artery just adjacent to its bifurcation, with ectasia of the origin of right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) measuring 8 × 8 × 8 mm along with aneurismal dilatation/ectasia involving the terminal left internal cerebral artery and its bifurcation measuring 6 × 6 × 6 mm, extending to involve proximal A1 and M1 segments along with paucity of M2 and M3 cortical segment vessels. Small vessel ischemic changes were also seen. Thrombotic workup was found to be normal. Renal and lower limb dopplers were normal.\n\n【7】Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) done a year later revealed ectasia of the basilar artery at the bifurcation of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) A1 segment saccular aneurysm. Both right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA) showed vasculitic changes of patchy appearance most pronounced on the left side. ART was continued along with daily aspirin and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy.\n\n【8】Repeat MRI done 5 years later revealed aneurysms at the left internal carotid artery (ICA), with bifurcation of size 5 × 5 mm, and at the basilar artery bifurcation of size 8.7 × 7.6 mm.\n\n【9】DSA repeated 6 years later revealed diffuse narrowing of both right and left supra-clinoid internal carotid arteries (ICA), with aneurysmal dilatation at the right ICA top involving the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), proximal M1 with non-visualization of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) beyond proximal M1 with distal reformation via extensive lenticulostriate collaterals giving a puff of smoke appearance suggestive of moyamoya phenomenon as seen as Fig. 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|DSA showing ( **a** ) left supraclinoid ICA and ( **b** ) right supraclinoid ICA narrowing with obliteration of the anterior carotid and middle carotid arteries and extensive lenticulostriate collateral giving a puff of smoke appearance on both sides.</u>\n\n【11】On examination, his weight was 42.45 kg and height was 160 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was 16.58 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ( _Z_ score between −2 and − 3 SD). His heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute and blood pressure was 114/80 mmHg. Old scars of varicella infection were present over the face. Cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a residual paresis on the right side with a power of Grade 5. The aspirin was discontinued and the patient continues to be on regular follow-up.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】HIV-associated vasculopathy in patients with HIV-1 disease has been found to be due to the proinflammatory state and cytokine imbalance, leading to endothelial damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Involvement of the regulatory protein Tat in cytokine dysregulation in the central nervous system has been mentioned as a possible cause along with elevated levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Immune activation in response to transendothelial migration of HIV strains coupled with HIV tropism for brain mononuclear cells has been postulated in the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Moyamoya disease should be considered in children with HIV having a stroke. The most common arteries to be affected are the ICA, followed by the MCA and ACA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient also showed involvement of both the ICAs. Medial fibrosis, intimal hypoplasia and loss of muscularis and elastic tissue are the common histopathological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Intimal staining of the involved cerebral arteries have revealed transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-gp 41, suggesting transendothelial migration of the virus and a direct effect of the virus in the pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Varicella infection and tuberculosis have been described as possible aetiologies of acute hemiplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. However, our patient did not show any clinical signs of active infection. Complications of moyamoya disease include cerebral ischemia and haemorrhage, leading to weakness, speech disorder and convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with hemiparesis on the right side with no speech abnormalities or seizures. Treatment in children is largely conservative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, revascularization surgery is being increasingly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Early initiation of ART plays a vital role in the prevention of HIV vasculopathy. Protease inhibitors have been linked to drug-induced vasculopathy. Monitoring of patients to maintain good adherence to ART, thus achieving viral suppression and good immunity, may help prevent vascular complications. Ongoing clinical monitoring to prevent rupture of the cerebral aneurysm and haemorrhage is vital in these patients.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Krishna Chidrawar, Clinical fellow—Interventional Radiology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400022.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding towards the article processing charges received from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Taken from Hospital Ethics Committee.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient’s written consent was obtained for publication.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Noella Pereira, Consultant—Paediatric HIV & Telemedicine, Paediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DETAILS OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH AUTHOR\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors were involved in patient management, preparation of manuscript and approval of the final version.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT AND INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE WORK SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022, India.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DISCLAIMERS, IF ANY\n-------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:29", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:41", "cost": 11.929}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:28"}

AmC is a unique epithelial tumor with both exocrine and endocrine features in the same cell, showing an adenocarcinoma-like cellular form but also having intracellular endocrine granules. AmC is sometimes confused with mixed adenoendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) in the World Health Organization classification of neuroendocrine tumors from 2010. However, MANEC is defined as carcinoma having components of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma (30% or more) in different cells. There are reports on pathological findings or surgical management of AmC, but few reports on chemotherapy for metastatic AmC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】We describe a case of metastatic rectal AmC treated with FOLFOXIRI.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Pathological findings of the surgically resected rectum: ( **A** ) histopathological examination revealed that tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm having circular irregular nuclei and signet cells containing abundant mucus were mixed and proliferated; ( **B** ) synaptophysin was diffusely positive; ( **C** ) chromogranin A was focally positive.</u>\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 64-year-old male underwent endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for a sessile type lesion (0-Is) in the rectum 2 years before presentation. The histological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma invading into the muscularis mucosae. The tumor was close to the vertical stump, and there were some areas where it was difficult to determine the stump due to the influence of cauterization. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not applied because it was determined the pathological curative resection had been performed. Upon presentation to the clinic, he was diagnosed with a submucosal lesion on the EMR scar from the rectum to anal canal on the anal transition zone. Histopathological examination suggested a local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. He was referred to our hospital for definitive diagnosis and treatment a month after the endoscopic biopsy. FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) showed 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) accumulation of pelvic lymph nodes (maximum standardized uptake value \\[SUVmax\\] 4.7) but not in the rectum.\n\n【9】Two months after the endoscopic biopsy, an endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for diagnostic purposes was performed for the local recurrent lesion. Histopathological examination revealed tumor cells with round atypical nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm and signet cells in the epithelium. Synaptophysin was diffusely positive in tumor cells of both histological types, and chromogranin A was focally positive by immunohistochemistry. This indicated the tumor had both exocrine and endocrine features in the same cell. The final diagnosis was rectal AmC.\n\n【10】A month later, endoscopic ultrasound of pelvic lymph nodes and a colonoscopy were performed. Pelvic lymph nodes accumulated FDG could not be detected, but the local recurrence of AmC on the ESD scar was shown. A month later, an abdominoperineal resection including dissection of lymph nodes was performed, resulting in R0 resection. Findings of the histopathological examination of surgically resected specimens were similar to those of the previous endoscopic biopsy. CDX-2 and synaptophysin were diffusely positive, chromogranin A and MUC2 were focally positive and MUC5AC and MUC6 were negative . The recurrent rectal AmC was partially exposed to the surface layer and invaded into veins and lymphatic vessels. Tumor cells were also found in pelvic lymph nodes. Comprehensive genetic testing showed mutation of KRAS codon 61 Q61R, CCND1 amplification, FGF19 amplification and FGF3 amplification.\n\n【11】A month after surgical resection, CT showed liver metastases . FOLFOXIRI was chosen as first-line palliative chemotherapy. Heterozygosity for the UGT1A1\\*28 allele was recognized. The regimen of FOLFOXIRI was folinic acid \\[L-LV; 200 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , on day 1\\] + irinotecan \\[CPT-11; 150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , on day 1\\] + oxaliplatin \\[L-OHP; 85 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , on day 1\\] + fluorouracil \\[5-FU; 2400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , continuous infusion for 46 h\\]. Compared with the original FOLFOXIRI regimen, CPT-11 and 5-FU were reduced due to concerns of adverse side effects. The best overall response (BOR) was partial response (PR) (−37.5%) after six cycles of FOLFOXIRI . After six cycles of FOLFOXIRI, the treatment regimen was changed to FOLFIRI due to peripheral neuropathy. After 12 cycles of FOLFIRI, the disease progressed. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.7 months. After progression, FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (Bmab) was administered. The BOR was stable disease (+6.5%) after four cycles of FOLFOX plus Bmab. After eight cycles of FOLFOX plus Bmab, disease progression was confirmed, resulting in PFS of 4.4 months. He died due to the primary disease 16.0 months after the induction of FOLFOXIRI.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Comparison of computed tomography images of multiple liver metastases ( **A** ) before FOLFOXIRI, ( **B** ) after two cycles of FOLFOXIRI and ( **C** ) after six cycles of FOLFOXIRI.

A total of 22 cases of colorectal AmC have been previously described in seven reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–8 \\]</u>. Three patients were treated with palliative chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Karkouche _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported a case in which PR was confirmed in first-line chemotherapy with XELOX, but response was not achieved in second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. Huang _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported two cases; one patient with liver and lung metastases received palliative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) was 12 months. The other with liver metastasis received chemotherapy and has survived for >33 months. Details of treatment are not described. AmC is characterized by a mixture of pathological features of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Some efficacious chemotherapy agents are suitable for both adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas, whereas some other chemotherapy agents only work for one type of tumor. In our case, FOLFOXIRI was chosen for first-line chemotherapy, with the expectation that it would work for both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma as 5-FU is effective for rectal adenocarcinoma and CPT-11 and platinum agents are effective for both adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas. FOLFOXIRI is usually used for colorectal adenocarcinomas with an objective response rate, median PFS and OS reported as 66%, 9.8 months and 22.6 months, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the present case, PR was achieved, and PFS was 8.7 months. As expected, FOLFOXIRI was as effective for AmC of the rectum as for colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, OS was 16.0 months, indicating that AmC has a worse prognosis than colorectal adenocarcinoma. If the resection had been performed earlier and adjuvant chemotherapy had been administered, metastases might not have appeared or might have appeared much later. But this does not affect the efficacy of palliative chemotherapy including PFS, OS and response. FOLFOXIRI as palliative chemotherapy was administered as soon as possible after metastases was confirmed. Therefore, multiple drug combination therapy effective for both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma may be the best option for the treatment of rectal AmC.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report was approved by Institutional Review Board of National Cancer Center Hospital 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017-229)</u>.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient is deceased.

Following ileostomy reversal, he complained of intense, unremitting anorectal pain. After repeated scans, computed tomography (CT) showed findings suggestive of a longstanding anastomotic leak. Subsequent, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteomyelitis of the sacrum, with the development of sacral osteomyelitis in this context unusual. Our case highlights the importance of appropriate radiological imaging and that clinicians should consider osteomyelitis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe anorectal pain after treatment for rectal cancer.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】A 66-year-old man with a diagnosis of moderately differentiated T3 N1 M0 adenocarcinoma of the rectum in 2015 underwent short course radiotherapy prior to anterior resection that was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, which were stopped prematurely due to grade 1 peripheral neuropathy. His temporary ileostomy was reversed 1 year later. Following reversal, he was troubled with on-going difficulties of bowel function including increased frequency, urgency with incontinence and tenesmus. Most troublesome of all was progressive rectal pain. He was referred to our Consequences of Colorectal Cancer Clinic, 4 years later.\n\n【4】Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed no significant changes other than a previous anterior resection. His blood tests during this time showed normal leukocyte counts and a mildly elevated C-reactive protein that ranged from 16 to 29. Three CT scans of his abdomen and pelvis were arranged before referral to us. The initial CT in July 2017 showed presacral soft tissue thickening with air pockets that were in keeping with typical postsurgical changes. However, unusually, this presacral collection became more prominent in subsequent CT scans. By the time of his third CT in late 2018, a fistula between the rectum and the presacral collection at the anastomotic site could be identified , suggesting a longstanding anastomotic leak. Multiple sinus tracts were also seen on this CT scan.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Axial section of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) shows the communication of rectum to presacral collection at anastomotic site.</u>\n\n【6】Due to his on-going symptoms and for better delineation of the anatomic structures, MRI of the sacrum and coccyx with Short-TI Inversion Recovery sequences was requested. This showed hyperintense signalling in the lower sacral vertebrae representing changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis . The presacral collection was also again seen and consistent with a persistent small leak from his previous anterior resection. The patient was therefore discussed at the surgical MDT. The decision was made to treat him empirically with 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. There was no attempt made to obtain an aspirate from the collection. Once the antibiotic treatment was completed, the patient went on to have a Hartmann’s procedure performed. This led to very rapid reduction in and then abolition of his pain. On subsequent reviews, his stoma was functioning well and he had no rectal symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Short-TI Inversion Recovery coronal sequence showing hyperintense signal in lower sacral vertebrae representing changes due to chronic osteomyelitis.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Long-term significant defaecatory dysfunction following anterior resection is estimated to occur in between 37 and 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. When anorectal pain is present, it may indicate local recurrence, anal fissuring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> or rarely deep ulceration of ischaemic origin, either from the radiotherapy or injudicious endoscopic or local surgical intervention in irradiated mucosa. Radiotherapy-induced insufficiency fractures may also be a cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Occasionally, anorectal pain after pelvic radiation therapy is attributed to neuropathy; however, in our experience, this is very rare with modern radiotherapy techniques. Symptoms develop insidiously and are often dismissed when recurrence has been excluded.\n\n【10】Sacral osteomyelitis is an extremely rare complication of treatment for pelvic cancer. When it occurs, it is usually associated with fistulization from the rectum as in our patient or in one other case we have found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> or from the urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If left untreated, it can often be life-threatening due to the sequelae of sepsis, neurological involvement and fulminant faecal meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】MRI imaging should be utilized to assess patients with ongoing anorectal pain following treatment for pelvic cancer. In those who have developed sacral osteomyelitis, MRI demonstrates changes in the water content of bone marrow while also providing excellent structural definition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It also helps to plan for optimal surgical management and to assess the extent of devitalized tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. If MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, nuclear medicine studies and CT are useful alternatives. Nuclear medicine studies involve intravenous administration of a radionuclide, which emits radiation that is detected by a gamma camera. This allows assessment of abnormal bone metabolism, which in osteomyelitis manifests as areas of increased radionuclide uptake. In general, nuclear medicine studies have very high sensitivity in the detection of osteomyelitis and allow imaging of the whole skeleton to look for multiple sites of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, they are limited by poor specificity and anatomical localization. CT, on the other hand, can demonstrate clearly the anatomical relationship between areas of infection and important structures, such as adjacent bowel and major vessels. CT also has superior bony resolution to MRI and is better at demonstrating osseous changes such as cortical destruction, periosteal reactions and sequestrum formation. However, CT is unable to demonstrate bone marrow oedema, which means that a normal CT does not exclude early osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Treatment of sacral osteomyelitis is often multi-modal and can involve a combination of targeted antibiotic therapy, radiological drainage and/or surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Our case report highlights the strengths of focused cardiac ultrasound in differential diagnosis of shock and paradoxical embolism, especially valuable in patients with COVID-19 when access to other imaging modalities can be limited.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with the history of hypertension presented to the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic with significant shortness of breath on minimal exertion and fatigue for 3 weeks. Patient was hypoxic to 74% and tachypneic to 30 breaths/min and required endotracheal intubation. Physical exam was unremarkable. Shortly, thereafter, she became persistently hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with rate of 70 bpm, tall R wave in V2 and symmetric T wave inversions in precordial leads . Chest radiograph post intubation showed bilateral patchy infiltrates. Initial severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test was negative while the second PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done 24 h later returned positive.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Initial electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with rate of 70 bpm, tall R wave in V2 and symmetric T wave inversions in precordial leads.</u>\n\n【7】Initial troponin T was 0.07 ng/ml with maximum at 0.22 ng/ml (reference range < 0.01 ng/ml) and NT-proBNP was 12 945 pg/ml. Elevated white blood cell count (21.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl), creatinine (1.45 mg/dl), C-reactive protein (25.9 mg/dl) and ferritin (546 ng/ml) and D- Dimer 4.34 (ref range ≤ 0.63 mg/l) was noted. Serial ECGs remained stable.\n\n【8】Patient remained persistently hypoxic with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO2 ratio of 85 which along with CXR findings is suggestive of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Central venous oxygen saturation of 62% suggested the possibility of mixed shock.\n\n【9】Computed tomography angiogram of chest was deferred due to hemodynamic instability and refractory hypoxemia. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated. Due to institutional COVID-19 policy for transthoracic echocardiography to minimize personnel exposure, focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) was performed, which revealed mildly increased right ventricular cavity size with flattened septum in systole and diastole along with bowing of interatrial septum toward the left supporting ECG findings of right ventricular strain . Due to suspected massive pulmonary embolism (PE) alteplase 50 mg was given intravenously over 120 min. This resulted in significant improvement of hemodynamics, perfusion indices and oxygenation within next 12 h to the extent that hypotension resolved despite being on high PEEP protocol for ARDS.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Parasternal short-axis view demonstrating dilated right ventricle (star) with flattened septum (arrow).</u>\n\n【11】After 24 h, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite being off sedation. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of head revealed multifocal infarcts of both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres with associated mass effects concerning for acute ischemic infarcts. Follow-up CT in 12 h revealed hemorrhagic transformation and anticoagulation with heparin was held. Due to concern for cardioembolic phenomenon, FoCUS with agitated saline was done that showed early right to left shunt consistent with patent foramen ovale (PFO) . Doppler ultrasound of legs did not reveal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). No evidence of atrial fibrillation was noted on prolonged cardiac monitoring.

Distributive shock from inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is common, but other types of shock including cardiogenic, obstructive (including tamponade and tension pneumothorax), as well as mixed shock should be considered. Myopericarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infraction (MI) should be in the differential for cardiogenic shock in such patients. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose obstructive shock from PE given significant hypoxemia in severe COVID-19 cases due to ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Classic ECG changes of right ventricular strain S1Q3T3 are insensitive. On the other hand, simultaneous T wave inversions in inferior and precordial leads with maximum amplitude of T wave in V1–V2 was previously reported, as sign of PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Hypercoagulability, both in macro and microvascular circulation, is important contributor to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, and our understanding of the disease is evolving rapidly. Macro-thrombotic events including acute MI, acute limb ischemia, stoke, DVT, PE as well as pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy with micro-thrombotic complications are described in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis of these grave thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes substantially.\n\n【19】COVID-19 pandemic created a situation wherein healthcare workers safety and highest care to patients must be in delicate balance. Multiple institutions including American Society of Echocardiography implemented new policies to change use criteria and protocols for different imaging modalities to limit exposure of healthcare workers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. FoCUS is valuable bedside tool and able to provide information on left and right ventricular systolic function, valvular abnormalities, pericardial effusion and volume status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are only limited reports on echocardiography and FoCUS use in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Study by European Association of cardiovascular imaging showed 55% of patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal echocardiography results which changed the management in one-third of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In a smaller study of 91 suspected or known COVID-19 patients, sonographers spent significantly less time using handheld ultrasound but still provided sufficient information for clinical team 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The major limitation of FOCUS is the diagnostic accuracy is dependent on the operator’s skills.\n\n【20】In our case, FoCUS was not only used for diagnosis of massive PE but also to diagnose the large interatrial shunt. Prompt diagnosis of massive PE and appropriate thrombolysis dramatically improved hemodynamics and oxygenation. Although stroke can be explained by prothrombotic state in COVID-19, embolic origin, particularly paradoxical embolism, needs to be ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. FoCUS with agitated saline confirmed the diagnosis of interatrial right to left shunting as route for paradoxical embolism.\n\n【21】To conclude, FoCUS facilitated diagnosis of massive pulmonary thromboembolism and interatrial shunt that guided clinical management. High clinical suspicion for thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients is required for prompt diagnosis. FoCUS is a helpful tool readily available at bedside with advantage of limiting exposure of healthcare workers.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Stuart Zarich MD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:51:16", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:51:31", "cost": 14.869}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:51:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:51:16"}

Though unusual, 40 case studies of nasal cavity PA by Compagno and Wong 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> and 59 cases by Wakami 通用删除7(英):<u>(1996)</u> have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Literature review of 101 cases of sinonasal PA by Rha et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> showed the incidence more common in females. Most common site of origin of nasal PA was septum (57.42%) with one-sided nasal blockage as the most common presenting symptom followed by epistaxis, mass in the nose, external swelling, epiphora and mucopurulent rhinorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Diagnosis of nasal cavity PA is confirmed by histopathological examination. Histologically, PA comprises of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in stromal matrix. However, in PA of nasal cavity, myoepithelial cellularity is unusually increased, which makes diagnosis difficult sometimes as revealed by Compagno and Wong 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> as well as Shih-Hung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A misdiagnosed case of nasal PA as adenoid cystic carcinoma was reported by Haberman and Stanely 通用删除7(英):<u>(1989)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging helps in locating the tumor rather than diagnosing.\n\n【15】Although benign, it can have local recurrences. The mesenchymal component myxoid stroma could be locus for future recurrence if it gets spilled into the surgical field 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Occasionally, it can behave like malignant tumor. About, 2.5–10% malignant change over rate with female majority was reported by Compango et al. reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Wide local resection with histological clear margin is generally performed for intranasal pleomorphic adenoma to reduce the rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Different surgical approaches like intranasal endoscopic, transnasal endoscopic, lateral rhinotomy, external rhinoplasty and mid-facial degloving can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusion, nasal PA is not only rare tumor, but also difficult to diagnose. PA has high myoepithelial cellularity with less stromal matrix. In case of chronic unilateral nasal blockage due to mass, PA should be considered as a differential diagnosis. The recurrences of PA over a duration of 7–25 years after primary surgery have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, long-term follow-up is necessary as it gives an idea of extent of recurrence, if any, or malignant change over as well as the feasibility of treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge ENT department staffs who participated in the care of this case.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed for this case report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors obtained written informed consent from the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Gyan Raj Aryal.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:14", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:30", "cost": 15.142}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:09"}

In January 2017, she presented with 3 days of malaise with typical headache and right sided upper limb aching with incoordination. The following day she presented with repeated 10-min episodes of left facial and upper limb weakness and word-finding difficulties. She was reviewed by neurology team and her workup suggested a right carotid territory dissection with parietal cortex involvement on MR imaging; however, MR angiography revealed widespread large vessel vasculitis with proximal right brachiocephalic, right common carotid artery, left carotid artery origin and left Subclavian involvement .

IV methylprednisolone was given for 5 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisolone. The inflammatory markers improved but had not normalized. Following the seventh course of cyclophosphamide, she had a left middle cerebral artery embolic event in late 2017. Angiogram showed progression of the disease in the major arteries of the neck . Because of refractory disease, her treatment was changed to subcutaneous TCZ (162 mg weekly), azathioprine and a weaning dose of prednisolone (25 mg). Azathioprine was started at 50 mg daily and escalated to 100 mg. She conceived on this combination and was assessed first time in our combined Rheumatology/Obstetrics clinic at 14 weeks gestation (March 2019). She had no other co-morbidities and was a non-smoker. Baseline blood pressure (BP) in her thigh was 130/84 mmHg and 90/68 and 67/53 mmHg in her left and right arms, respectively. Her Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS) at first pregnancy visit was 0 (scored retrospectively by INB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and her CRP was 5 mg/l (normal < 5.0). Given her extensive disease and previous life-threatening complications and following detailed discussion with the patient and her partner, a decision to continue TCZ was made, with close monitoring and multi-disciplinary support. A steroid-taper of 5 mg every 4 weeks was initiated, and she was started on aspirin 150 mg at night and tinzaparin 4500 IU daily.\n\n【9】BP monitoring used her thigh or calf and at 22 weeks, amlodipine 5 mg daily was added as her BP was 170/70 mmHg. Ultrasound assessments of placental function were performed at 17 and 22 weeks. There was normal foetal growth and both uterine artery dopplers demonstrated normal resistance waveforms. Because of risk of pre-eclampsia urine protein ratio was check at each clinic visit and this remained within normal range (0–30 mg/mmol).\n\n【10】Prednisolone was further tapered to 7.5 mg daily by 34 weeks and maintained through the rest of her pregnancy. Systemically, she had no TA flares; at her 34-week visit her ITAS score remained 0 and her CRP was <1.0 mg/L. There were concerns over the risks of vaginal delivery, and an elective caesarean section (CS) was planned at 39 weeks gestation. However, spontaneous labour occurred 2 days before her scheduled admission date and she had an emergency CS. She delivered a baby girl weighing 2768 grams with no peri-partum maternal or foetal complications. TCZ and azathioprine were withheld during the peri-partum period for 2–3 weeks until her CS wound healed and she had IV hydrocortisone 25 mg three times daily for 48 h and then prednisolone was continued at 7.5 mg daily.\n\n【11】Few months later 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>, she underwent MRA brain and carotid to assess disease status. Imaging was discussed at neuroradiology multidisciplinary team meeting; the stenotic lesion remained stable and there were no radiographic features to suggest disease progression.\n\n【12】Subsequently she has been maintained on TCZ and AZA and her prednisolone was tapered to 5 and 7.5 mg alternate days. More recent imaging 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u> confirms disease stability. At the time of reporting, her baby is 40 months old and is healthy.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Relapsing, resistant TA poses significant challenges during pregnancy. Whilst biologics are discontinued prior to pregnancy or early in the first trimester; uncontrolled or flaring disease can put both the mother and foetus at risk of complications such as worsening hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity and/or intra-uterine growth restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. High-dose glucocorticoids also contribute to BP dysregulation and impaired glucose tolerance, thus adding to overall pregnancy risks.\n\n【15】TCZ provides good disease control and is steroid sparing. No relevant placental transfer of IgG1 occurs in the first trimester; however, transfer can increasingly occur through the second and third trimesters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Current guidelines suggest stopping TCZ 3 months prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Data regarding TCZ safety in pregnancy are mainly from RA patients. One case series of prenatal or early first trimester exposure to TCZ found that in 180 prospective and 108 retrospective cases there was no substantial increase in the rate of congenital malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The rate of spontaneous abortion (21%) was similar to the general population (10–20%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A retrospective analysis of 61 Japanese RA patients on TCZ found that the rate of spontaneous abortion (18%), congenital abnormalities (none) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (10%) were similar to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this study, only one patient continued TCZ throughout pregnancy and delivered a baby with a low birth weight (<2000 g).\n\n【17】We found two cases of patients taking TCZ in pregnancy for TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. As with our case, both had refractory disease with extensive damage. TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy in one patient and stopped at 6 weeks gestation in the other. Pregnancy outcomes were favourable apart from one case developing neonatal jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】More recently TCZ has been widely used for the management of severe COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ten pregnant patients were included in trial; however, no specific maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted. In another retrospective study of 12 pregnant women with COVID-19 receiving TCZ, all pregnancies resulted in live births, there were two reports of transient hepatotoxicity and one of cytomegalovirus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. To gain further understanding and effect of immunomodulators on pregnancy and neonatal outcome, a more robust regulatory structure for recruiting pregnant patient in clinical trial is warranted.\n\n【19】Our case had aggressive TA and since the benefits of continuing TCZ to maintain stable disease outweighed the theoretical risks, TCZ was continued through pregnancy with a successful outcome. This case also highlights the need for accurate monitoring BP in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. In selected cases, TCZ therefore has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【21】In selected cases, TCZ has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy. It is pertinent to monitor BP accurately in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. Our case report also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary team role in managing such complex cases.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval required.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

A life-threatening and potentially fatal manifestation of thyrotoxicosis is thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is considered rare with an occurrence rate of 1–2% of all patients with hyperthyroidism, making a high index of suspicion important in the early recognition of this debilitating complication. We present the case of a 63-year-old female with a significant history of being non-compliant with her hyperthyroidism regimen and presented to the emergency department in severe respiratory distress. She was ultimately diagnosed with thyroid storm induced high-output congestive heart failure, intubated, had a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the intensive care unit in a guarded condition. Her hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged on Day 12.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】The most common underlying etiology of a thyroid storm is Grave’s disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyrotropin receptor antibodies. As an endocrine emergency and sepsis mimic, thyroid storm becomes a must recognize disease process, with an untreated mortality of 100% and 10–50% with treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of thyroid storm is diverse, presents within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis and requires a multifactorial treatment regimen. As a severe hypermetabolic condition, thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician.\n\n【4】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) in severe respiratory distress. She stated, ‘I had asthma as a kid, this kind of feels like that.’ Symptoms started abruptly 2 days ago while she was leaving her house to go shopping and continued to progressively get worse. Associated symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic chest pain, diaphoresis and lightheadedness. She denied any recent travel, hormone replacement, prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, calf pain/leg pain or any other symptoms. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure 220/114 mmHg, respiratory rate up to 42 breaths/min, heart rate of 124 beats/min and a pulse ox of 88% on a non-rebreather. Physical exam was notable for severe respiratory distress and diaphoresis with conversational dyspnea, intercostal retractions and supraclavicular retractions. The patient was not wanting to talk or move secondary to the shortness of breath. Examination of the head and neck revealed no evidence for proptosis; however, she did exhibit fullness to her thyroid bilaterally. Her cardiopulmonary exam revealed diffuse rales in all lung fields and no obvious murmur. Her lower extremities were significant for 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure on arrival, a high dose nitroglycerine infusion was started and furosemide was given. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus tachycardia at 119 with biatrial enlargement. Chest radiography, Fig. 1 , shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n【7】Blood pressure improved to 170/70 mmHg, and the patient was able to communicate regarding her medical history. She noted intermittent palpitations for over 1 year, decreased appetite, an unintentional 10-lb weight loss and blurry vision. Chart review revealed that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level performed as an outpatient 2 months prior returning a value of <0.01. At that time, a thyroid ultrasound was performed and was concerning for a solid right thyroid nodule measuring up to 1.8 cm. A subsequent technetium thyroid study revealed a goiter with increased technetium trapping consistent with the clinical suspicion of Graves’ disease. The patient had refused radioiodine therapy. She was prescribed methimazole and propranolol as an outpatient, but missed multiple doses frequently.\n\n【8】Within 5 minutes of arrival, she began to decompensate, with increasing diaphoresis, tachypnea, hypoxia, bradycardia and lethargy. Decision was thus made to intubate utilizing etomidate and rocuronium. Subsequent chest radiography post intubation, Fig. 2 , shows a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. Approximately 4 minutes later, her rhythm went from bradycardic into asystole. Advanced cardiac life support protocol was followed, with a resulting return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 5 minutes. Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion or right heart strain. CT angiography of the chest, Figs 3 and 4 , shows no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography post intubation showing a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.</u>\n\n【12】Laboratory evaluation was notable for a TSH <0.01 (0.40–4.50 mcIU/ml), free T3 of 10.2 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml), free T4 of 2.7 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL), brain natriuretic peptide of 566 (0–100 pg/ml), troponin of 0.01/0.12/0.24 (0.00–0.04 ng/ml) and blood glucose of 210. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 89, p02 345, HCO3 23. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable. No other acute lab abnormalities were found.\n\n【13】The case was discussed with endocrinology and she was started on the following regimen: propranolol 1 mg IV followed by 60 mg PO every 6 hours via her nasogastric tube, methimazole 20 mg loading dose followed by 20 mg every 6 hours, SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral Solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours, hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours and cholestyramine powder 4 gm via NG tube q6 hours. The patient was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition for suspected high output congestive heart failure secondary to thyroid storm from a non-compliance with her hyperthyroidism treatment. The elevated troponin was deemed likely a type II mechanism related to hypoxia, bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【14】By Day 2, the patient was alert on the ventilator, answering yes or no questions and doing well on spontaneous breathing trials. A formal 2D echocardiography showed mild eccentric mitral regurgitation, trace pulmonic insufficiency, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. By Day 5, she was transferred out of the ICU. By Day 7, her free T3 was approaching normal at 2.1 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml) and her free T4 normalized at 2.4 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL). It will take several weeks for the TSH to return to normal. Her remaining hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on Day 12. She later underwent radioactive iodine ablation as an outpatient. There will likely be a need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy once the patient develops an underactive thyroid. At her most recent endocrinology follow-up appointment, she remains compliant, has had a full return to baseline activities and enjoys spending time with her family.\n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Thyroid storm is a severe hypermetabolic condition resulting in increased sensitivity and expression of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to a higher response to endogenous catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are number of causes, including, but not limited to the following: medical non-compliance, untreated thyroid disease, trauma, myocardial ischemia, infection, overdose of thyroid hormone and diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our patient, her thyroid storm was secondary to medical non-compliance with her hyperthyroid medication and non-compliance with the recommended radioactive iodine treatment.\n\n【17】For the emergency physician, laboratory evaluation will reveal a TSH that is usually low or undetectable with an associated elevated T3 and T4. Other laboratory findings can include anemia, lower serum creatinine, hypercalcemia or thrombocytopenia. If adrenal insufficiency is also present, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation is extremely diverse, with similarities to a hyperadrenergic state, with multiple systems being affected.\n\n【18】*   Central nervous system manifestations (altered mental status, seizures, agitation, lethargy, psychosis and coma)\n\n【19】*   Cardiovascular manifestations (sinus tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chest pain, wide pulse-pressure and dyspnea on exertion)\n\n【20】*   Gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea)\n\n【21】*   Skin manifestations (flushed, warm, moist and possible vitiligo and hyperpigmentation)\n\n【22】*   Thyroid gland manifestations (diffuse enlargement, neck fullness and thyroid tenderness)\n\n【23】As the disease process progresses, excess amounts of thyroid hormone begin to have a significant impact on cardiovascular hemodynamics. The result is high-output congestive heart failure (an uncommon type of heart failure) as the cardiac tissue has an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. Characteristic features of a high-output congestive heart failure include an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. In this particular form of heart failure, the increased cardiac output is greater than the metabolic demand. Patients will present with an increased stroke volume, increased myocardial contractility, increased ejection fraction, atrial arrhythmia and systolic hypertension with an associated wide pulse pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If left untreated, the result is eventual dilated cardiomyopathy, lethal dysrhythmias and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This concept of high-output congestive heart failure is counterintuitive to the typical congestive heart failure secondary to other causes, such as a myocardial infarction, that results in decreased myocardial contractility, low cardiac output and ventricular arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Being within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis, distinguishing severe thyrotoxicosis from thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician. One set of diagnostic criteria that can be used to aid in diagnosing thyroid storm is the Burch-Wartofsky Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Components include the degree of fever, tachycardia, presence of atrial fibrillation, presence of congestive heart failure, any gastrointestinal dysfunction and any central nervous system dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A score greater than 45 points is diagnostic of thyroid storm, 25–44 points is associated with an impending thyroid storm and <25 points is unlikely. Our patient received 10 points for a fever of 101.2°F, 15 points for a heart rate of 124 beats/min, 20 points for congestive heart failure and 10 points for agitation, for a total score of 55 points. Another diagnostic aid that can be utilized in diagnosing thyroid storm are the criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association (presence of thyrotoxicosis in addition to at least one central nervous system dysfunction in combination with fever, CHF, tachycardia or gastrointestinal abnormality) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Treatment is multifactorial and involves a specific order to the treatment regimen as outlined below.\n\n【26】1.  Beta blocker is used to block the peripheral effects of the thyroid hormones and prevent the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is used for this reason to treat the systemic effects (starting dose is often 1 mg IV push, titrating 1–3 mg q10 minutes and PO formulations dosed at 60–80 mg q6 hours) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In our patient, she received 1 mg IV of propranolol and started on a PO formulation.\n\n【27】2.  Administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole is utilized to inhibit the _de novo_ synthesis of T3 and T4. PTU is typically given as a 600–1000 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg q6. Methimazole is typically given as a 20–30 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 20–30 mg q6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】3.  Administration of SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours or Lugol’s solution 4–8 gtts q6 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These will block the release of pre-formed thyroid hormones.\n\n【29】4.  Administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours or Dexamethasone 2–4 mg q6 hours) as thyroid storm causes depression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis. In addition, corticosteroids have the ability inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】5.  Administration of cholestyramine powder (4 g PO q6 hours) aids in reducing thyroid hormone levels by interfering with anterior hepatic circulation and recycling of thyroid hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Definitive treatment often post-hospitalization involves surgery or radioactive iodine, as our patient had received. The Journal of Clinical Apheresis published an article in 2018 regarding patients that cannot undergo thyroidectomy or fail pharmacotherapy. In these patients, plasma exchange has been suggested as another treatment option; however, the optimal role is not established and there are only a limited number of cases within the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】To decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with thyroid storm, an emergency medicine physician must consider this diagnosis in any patient presenting to the ED in a hypermetabolic state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common cause of death in thyroid storm is cardiopulmonary failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As a result, quick recognition and treatment is critical for patient survival.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest\n--------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support was received for this study.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.T. is the guarantor of this study.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:19", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:05:18", "cost": 59.076}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:05:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:19"}

The tumor clinically behaves in a benign manner and has a good prognosis. In some cases, however, PSP reportedly displays pathologically malignant characteristics such as lymph node metastases and necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These heterogenetic cases suggest that PSP has a clinico-pathological diversity. Herein, we present a case of a large PSP with massive necrosis and vascular invasions.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old woman presented with a cough and breathlessness. She was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow over the whole left chest area and a mediastinal shift on chest radiography . Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 15 × 14 × 10 cm mass filling almost the entire left thoracic cavity, which had an extensive low-density area on enhancement . There were also multiple nodules in the opposite lung . Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT revealed a mild Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation within the tumor in the left thorax and one nodule in the right lung, and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) were 6.5 and 2.3, respectively . Although the large tumor size, massive necrosis and the multiple nodules in the opposite lung suggested advanced lung cancer, the mild accumulation of FDG seemed atypical. Furthermore, her general condition was relatively good considering advanced cancer. Subsequent CT-guided tumor biopsy showed a proliferation of round cells with central bland nuclei and low nuclear atypia that were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and low Ki-67 labeling index (<5%). These findings raised PSP as a differential diagnosis in a multidisciplinary board. We, therefore, performed a left pneumonectomy to obtain the definite diagnosis and to palliate the symptoms caused by the rightward mediastinal shift.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Results of laboratory imaging techniques.

There was no lymph node metastasis; however, endobronchial locations and vascular invasions were observed . The Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed overall labeling index of 5% with partially highly-proliferating areas of up to 30% .

We inferred that the nodules were multiple synchronous diseases, but it was difficult to distinguish from metastasis from the left tumor.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】PSP is relatively rare benign tumor with four distinct histological patterns: solid, papillary, sclerotic and hemorrhagic. According to some recent studies, PSP is considered to originate from primitive respiratory epithelium and is characterized as a tumor of pneumocytic origin with a dual population of cuboidal surface cells and stromal round cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Therefore, PSP was reclassified as adenoma from the previous category of miscellaneous tumors in the 2015 World Health Organization Classification, and its name was changed from ‘sclerosing hemangioma’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PSP clinically behaves in a benign manner. One study showed that the doubling time of PSP is 660–1250 days, which is slower than that of malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The prognosis after surgical resection is generally good, and deaths have not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】On the other hand, clinically malignant findings such as lymph node metastasis are reported to occur in approximately 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>, which makes difficult to distinguish from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (predominantly solid subtype). Histopathological characteristics such as dual population of tumor cells with little nuclear atypia, various proliferation patterns and IHC results confirmed the definitive diagnosis, however, the present case had some atypical characteristics for PSP as follows.\n\n【14】Firstly, the tumor size of 15 cm was noteworthy. Although two previous reports have reported PSPs of more than 10 cm, the present case was the largest one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Secondly, a massive necrosis, endobronchial lesion and multifocal lesions were observed. Previous reports showed that necrosis, multifocal and endobronchial lesion were rarely observed in PSP, and the incidences were 8% 4% and 1%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Thirdly, vascular invasion was observed, which has not been reported to date.\n\n【15】We did not perform genetic studies because its utility to distinguish synchronous PSPs from metastasis reportedly has not been established at this time. However, recent study of genetic analysis for multiple synchronous PSP identified mutations in genes, which may provide the clues to elucidate the nature of PSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Further, histopathological and genetic studies are very interesting and may clarify the feature and diversity of PSP.\n\n【16】In conclusion, this case suggested that PSP had a variety of histopathological findings and sometimes could show an aggressive clinical feature like advanced lung cancer.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National Cancer Center Hospital IRB approval number: 2017–418.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained comprehensive informed consent from the patient before this study.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:47:36", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:48:44", "cost": 67.989}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:48:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:47:36"}

Although it is considered one of the most fatal tumors in the world, its early diagnosis is associated with a better prognosis and overall survival. A 49-year-old man was admitted to the dermatology department with a 15 cm lesion on the left arm. It was growing on a congenital nevus to reach an enormous size. Surgical excision was not possible and the treatment was controversial as the patient showed unpredicted resistance to immunotherapy. Further evaluations revealed false-negative BRAF mutation, which completely changed the course of treatment. Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer. Although there is no decisive definition of giant melanoma, some authors define it as a lesion of more than 10 cm in diameter. Through the literature, only a few cases of giant melanoma on the arm have been reported. Through our paper, we are revealing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma and confirming the significant role of regular follow-up for patients with a congenital melanocytic nevus. Moreover, we are showing the importance of having alternative methods for detecting BRAF mutations to avoid false-negative results and have better outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Malignant melanoma represents only about 1% of all skin cancers and <1% grows on a congenital nevus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, melanoma is an aggressive tumor and its incidence is increasing. It usually tends to grow rapidly but rarely measures more than 10 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, we reported a giant pigmented nodular melanoma that was neglected and disregarded, and it grew on a congenital nevus.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male was presented to our clinic with a wide ulcerated skin lesion on the upper area of the left arm. It started 6 months earlier on a congenital nevus, which remained unchanged since birth. There were no skin tumors in his family history. Laboratory tests were within the normal range. Physical examination showed a reddish-brown to black-colored, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion. It measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 2 cm in the left deltoid area .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Clinical image showing a giant cutaneous lesion, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion.</u>\n\n【7】There were many differential diagnoses.

Superficial spreading melanoma presents as a scalloped, asymmetric and irregular papule or macule arising on previous nevi or developed _de novo_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】A cutaneous biopsy was performed and sent to the pathology department. Microscopic examination of the biopsy revealed proliferation of variably size nodules of malignant cells in the dermis . Infiltrated atypical polymorphic melanocytes with mild lymphoid inflammatory cells  and coarse brown pigments were observed . The malignant cells had large hyperchromatic nuclei with basophilic cytoplasm . To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains were applied. The tumor cells were positive for melanoma cocktail  and were negative for pan-cytokeratin . We did not perform dermoscopy because of its size and necrotic status, which pushed us to do the biopsy as early as possible.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin and eosin stain ( **A** – **D** ) and IHC ( **E** and **F** ): Microscopic images of cutaneous biopsy.

Therefore, targeted therapy with anti-BRAF drugs was excluded and the patient underwent chemotherapy with dacarbazine 250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1 → D5. A good response started after two courses but the patient had rapid progression after initiating the third course, which encouraged us to change the protocol to paclitaxel 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15 and carboplatin 150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15, but there was no response. At that stage, the patient suffered from disabled left arm due to severe pain and edema. Immunotherapy with nivolumab 280 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> was initiated, but unfortunately, there was no response observed after three courses. Surgical consultation claimed that surgical intervention is inapplicable due to locally advanced disease. Another wedge biopsy was taken for further histopathology evaluation. The result was identical to the first biopsy. The tumor was invading to anatomic level (at least V-Clark) and a measured depth (at least 3.5 cm-Breslow). The second BRAF mutation analysis, in contrast to the first one, came positive for BRAF V600E mutation. Targeted therapy with vemurafenib 960 mg was initiated. A significant response was noted within 2 weeks, including the appearance , edema, pain and distant metastases. Three months later, a brain MRI showed multiple lesions in both brain lobes and the brainstem with altered mental status and confusion. Unfortunately, the patient deteriorated rapidly and died due to complications of his brain metastases.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Clinical image shows very good response and the lesion has regressed properly after 1 month of targeted therapy.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Better survival and a quicker response to treatment in patients with positive BRAF mutation had been reported after the development of the BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The BRAF gene organizes and adjusts the division and senescence of the cells to prevent the proliferation of cancer precursor cells, by encoding a protein kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The deregulation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway occurs when the BRAF mutation gets activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. V600E type is the most observed BRAF mutation in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the lesion has been neglected by the patient, evolving rapidly to reach an enormous size. Such growing on a congenital nevus may have been a contributing factor in the ignorance of this lesion. A false-negative BRAF mutation result, using polymerase chain reaction, led us to exclude targeted therapy. Unresponsiveness to immunotherapy was unjustified, which guide us to order a second BRAF mutation analysis, and in contrast to the first one, it came positive for BRAF mutation. False-negative BRAF mutation results can be a threatening problem, eventuating in delayed treatment and poor outcomes. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using VE1, unlike DNA-based techniques, recognizes the therapeutic target protein and estimates its expression in malignant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, IHC is less expensive, can be used on fewer tumor cells, is simpler and has faster results compared to DNA-based techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, IHC using VE1 can only detect the V600E mutation. Therefore, combining both, DNA-based techniques and IHC using VE1 can lead to more accurate results in BRAF mutation analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive type of skin cancer that can arise from a pre-existing congenital nevus.

A Leadless pacemaker, Micra-transcatheter pacing system (Micra-TPS) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), was implanted through the right femoral vein. The pacemaker had a poor threshold after the first deployment and was retrieved. It was redeployed, and a good threshold was achieved. Afterward, her systolic blood pressure decreased from 180 mmHg (at the time of admission) to 70 mmHg, resulting in cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion, which was suggestive of cardiac injury and cardiac tamponade. She underwent emergency pericardial drainage and 300 ml of bloody pericardial fluid was drained, after which she recovered from shock. However, due to persistent drainage of bloody pericardial fluid, we performed an emergency thoracotomy. We found a full-thickness traumatic myocardial injury measuring ~10 mm on the anterior surface of the right ventricle .

This can result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the location of the embolism. The risks and benefits of closure of small PFOs have not been well elucidated in prior studies. We describe a patient with a history of Factor V Leiden heterozygosity who presented with left arm pain secondary to arterial embolism. The patient was a 51-year-old male who initially presented to the emergency department after awaking from sleep with progressive, severe, burning left arm pain. He had also noted intermittent shortness of breath over the 2 weeks prior to admission. Temperature was 97.4 F, pulse 86, respiratory rate 20 and blood pressure 121/87. Oxygen saturation was 94% on supplemental oxygen. He had a cool left upper extremity and the patient described subjective paresthesias in this extremity. Left radial pulse was difficult to palpate. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.217 ng/l. White blood cell count was 11.8 and INR 1.1. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific T abnormalities in the anterior leads. His past medical history was notable for only hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke; there is currently no absolute indication for closure device. We describe the case of a 51-year-old male who had presented with left arm pain and shortness of breath. The computed tomography (CT) angiography of chest showed pulmonary emboli with heavy clot burden bilaterally. Heparin was started, but patient was found to have occlusion along large arteries of the left arm. Emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia were performed. The transthoracic echocardiogram done the next day with bubble study was positive for patent foramen ovale. Hypercoaguability showed factor V Leiden heterozygosity. Decision was made for the patient to initiate long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and closure was performed. Patient was advised that closure is off label but opted to proceed with closure in light of hypercoaguable state.\n\n【2】Chest X-ray did not show any process that could explain the acute hypoxic episode and patient sounded clear on lung exam. Hence, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest was performed with higher suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT angiography showed multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and left main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally . Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done showing ejection fraction of 65% and severely elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 72 mmHg . There was no free-floating cardiac thrombi detected, and echo did not show concomitant septal flattening; moreover, McConnell’s sign was not present Workup thus far was discussed with pulmonology and the patient was not felt to be a candidate for thrombectomy since he was not showing hemodynamic instability characteristic of massive PE, so therapeutic heparin drip was initiated and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for submassive PE.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT angiography of the chest was done showing multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally.

It was initially thought that the pain was musculoskeletal in nature; however, after discovery of multiple coagulation events, prospect for embolism was endorsed. He was sent for ultrasound of upper and lower extremities. Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities revealed acute deep venous thrombosis within the left posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Venous ultrasound of the upper extremities showed no evidence of clot. Arterial ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the left proximal to mid-brachial artery with reconstitution of flow at the level of the distal brachial artery. Vascular surgery was consulted and the patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia and sample of clot is shown.</u>\n\n【7】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【8】A repeat TTE was done the next day and bubble study was positive for a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted regarding the need for open heart surgery versus percutaneous closure of the PFO. It was decided that the patient initiate long-term anticoagulation and that percutaneous closure could be performed at a later date. Hematology was consulted and the patient underwent a hypercoagulability workup which later was remarkable for Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. The patient opted for treatment with rivaroxaban over warfarin, and therefore rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily was started with plans to adjust dosing to 20 mg daily in three weeks. Another TTE was done on admission Day 3 showing improvement of pulmonary artery systolic pressure with RVSP of 46 mmHg. Pulmonology recommended against inferior vena cava filter placement as patient had rapid clinical improvement with systemic anticoagulation. After 2 more days of observation and treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital with plans for outpatient follow-up.\n\n【9】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n---------------------\n\n【10】One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study . During outpatient cardiology follow-up, there was a discussion with the patient regarding the very large PFO/atrial septal defect (ASD) and his high risk of further embolic event. He was advised that closure is off-label and that the latest trials did not show superiority with closure versus anticoagulation. Given his high risk of embolic event, and because he was a scuba diver with increased risk for the decompression sickness, he opted to proceed with closure.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with TEE showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study.</u>\n\n【12】Three weeks later, patient underwent percutaneous closure of the PFO with intraoperative fluoroscopy guidance. A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device . This device consists of two disks, the first deployed on the left side of the PFO and then the second along the right side of the PFO. Placement was confirmed by TEE . Patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and plavix for 3 months and advised to continue systemic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6:|删除段之间换行|Placement was confirmed by TEE showing negative bubble study.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This patient was found to have a hypercoagulable state from Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. This predisposed him to the development of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and large bilateral PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The development of arterial embolus to the left arm was made possible by a large PFO and has been cited several times in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Paradoxical arterial embolism has been associated with PFO, atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), and ostium secundum ASD. Recommended therapy differs depending on the type of anomaly present and its characteristics that can predispose the patient to increased risk of arterial embolism events. PFO occurs in 25–30% of the general population. It is thought to be an innocent bystander in many patients with stroke; however, in the younger population (<55 years of age), it could be the underlying etiology for recurrent arterial embolus events, such as cryptogenic stroke or peripheral embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Currently, the usefulness of percutaneous closure of PFO versus surgical closure or medical therapy alone remains unclear. Further complicating factors to decide on treatment include hypercoaguable states that were not part of inclusion criteria when evaluating for efficacy. The current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Three studies (CLOSURE I trial, PC trial and RESPECT trial) have failed to demonstrate that percutaneous PFO closure relates significant reduction in primary endpoint (stroke, TIA, peripheral embolism, etc.) outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. However, extended data from the RESPECT trial after 10 years have shown some benefit to closure with 54% relative risk reduction for recurrent cryptogenic stroke versus those assigned to medical management of anticoagulation. Moreover, two more recent trials have shown some benefit to closure of PFO closure with aspirin in those with a true cryptogenic stroke: REDUCE and CLOSE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Additional randomized trial data are still needed to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous PFO closure as compared to other treatment modalities before considering a widespread use.\n\n【19】LEARNING POINTS\n---------------\n\n【20】In summary, paradoxical arterial embolism via PFO should be determined to be a possibility in a patient presenting with deep venous thrombosis and/or PE who also have evidence of an arterial embolic event. Testing may include CT angiogram, venous/arterial ultrasound and echocardiography with bubble study. Treatment options include systemic anticoagulation, IVC filter placement, percutaneous closure of PFO, surgical closure of PFO or no closure of PFO depending on the patient’s presentation, history, and consideration of indications/contraindications. Pending further randomized trial data, percutaneous PFO closure may be considered as for prevention of paradoxical arterial embolism.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:34", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:58", "cost": 23.399}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:33"}

It is followed by hyperglycemia, and other systemic diseases. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea associated with the same etiology have been reported, but cases with different etiologies have rarely been reported. We report a case in which the patient experienced both strokes and post-stroke-related hyperglycemic hemichorea. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain appeared different in these two episodes. Our case demonstrates the importance of evaluating every patient presented with recurrent hemichorea carefully, as the disorder may be caused by different conditions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The unilateral movement disorder, hemichorea, commonly stems from acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of contralateral cerebral lesions and is typically followed by hyperglycemia and other systemic diseases, such as hypoglycemia, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea have been reported and associated with the same etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>, However, different etiologies could contribute to the recurrence of hemichorea in the same patient.

In this work, we report a case of recurrent same-side hemichorea with different etiologies diagnosed by brain MRI images.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 58-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes for 12 years was presented at our hospital 4 years ago. Because of poor compliance, the patient has not been able to achieve the target glycemic treatment goal during the past 4 years. We observed two episodes of right hemichorea resulting in similar involuntary movements but in different brain MRI images and etiologies.\n\n【6】### The first episode\n\n【7】The first episode of right hemichorea brought him to our emergency room 2 weeks after a fall. Hyperglycemia (712 mg/dl) was also noted at that time. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain disclosed no specific findings. He was admitted and an MRI scan of the brain showed an old lacunar infarct at the left basal ganglion . His right hemichorea was resolved the day after admission without any treatment of the disorder. He had no neurologic deficit. Basal bolus insulin therapy was given for blood sugar control, and aspirin was given to prevent recurrent stroke after discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MR FLAIR image demonstrated one tiny hyperintensity lesion on basal ganglia (arrow) in patient’s first admission.</u>\n\n【9】### The second episode\n\n【10】After 4 years of follow-ups in the outpatient department, the patient’s compliance was still poor. He was hospitalized because of involuntary movement in his right upper limb and right jaw for 2 weeks. The involuntary movement subsided when he fell asleep. The neurological examination showed that muscle power and sensation of bilateral limbs were intact. His blood sugar was high (671 mg/dl) without ketoacidosis. The serum creatinine level was normal, and the HbA1c was 17.3%. A CT scan of brain showed increased density in the left basal ganglia . Further MRI scan was also performed to exclude acute stroke and disclosed an increased signal intensity on the T1-weighted image in left basal ganglion , which was compatible with hyperglycemic hemichorea. Initially, we prescribed Clonazepam and haloperidol for the hemichorea and basal bolus insulin for the hyperglycemia. His blood sugar improved dramatically, but the hemichorea only improved a little after 10 days of hospitalization. He was discharged with Clonazepam 0.5 mg QD for the hemichorea, and basal insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control. Two weeks later at an outpatient visit, his hemichorea improved gradually because the blood sugar was better controlled.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Brain CT scan showed increased density in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|T1 MRI showed hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】We reported a case of recurrent hemichorea in a 58-year-old man exhibiting different etiologies demonstrated by specific brain MRI findings. The most common cause of hemichorea is acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and the second is hyperglycemic hemichorea. Other causes including hypoglycemia, Sydenham’s disease, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome have also been reported. These different etiologies of hemichorea result in different brain imaging appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Typically, in hyperglycemic hemichorea, CT scans show hyperdense lesions at the contralateral basal ganglia and T1 MRI shows hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Both the CT and T1 MRI of our patient showed similar features. In an acute stroke, the MRI demonstrates lesions with hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images and with hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In an old ischemic stroke, MR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images demonstrate hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In hypoglycemia, T2 hyperintensity was noted at the basal ganglia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In uremia, T2 hyperintensity lesions with edematous and a rim enhancement were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, the MRI is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of the causes of hemichorea.\n\n【15】In addition, hyperglycemic hemichorea is a rare neurologic complication of poorly controlled diabetes, which was first described by Bedwell in 1960 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Most cases were old Asian women. The prognosis of hyperglycemic hemichorea was good and rare recurrences were reported after blood sugar was better controlled. The mean recovery days of hyperglycemic hemichorea is about 69 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, according to a recent report in Korea. Blood sugar control is key for the recovery of hyperglycemic hemichorea and neuroimage findings on follow-up MRIs are usually reversible as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In our patient, recurrent hemichorea with different etiologies was diagnosed primarily based on different neuroimaging findings, but also based on differences in the durations of the courses. The duration of the hemichorea was short for the first episode and diagnosed to be stroke related. The duration of the hemichorea was longer for the second episode and was diagnosed to be hyperglycemia related. This could be caused by the different etiologies or by hyperglycemic stress superimposed on the same atherosclerotic lesion.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by grant FEMH-2022-C-013 from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written and signed informed consent for publication of clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rong Lin is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:40:31", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:22", "cost": 351.202}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:40:31"}

Ocular metastasis secondary to gastrointestinal malignancy is rare. In managing patients with ocular metastasis, quality of life (specifically vision preservation) is one of the most important factors patients and providers consider when deciding on a treatment regimen. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have shown promising results as second-line therapy for patient with metastatic malignancy.

Choroidal metastasis may be a presenting sign of primary or recurrent malignancy, portends very poor survival rates, and is frequently associated with significant visual impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

We present a novel case of a patient with known esophageal adenocarcinoma who was found to have a new onset choroidal metastasis. The patient was treated with pembrolizumab with rapid visual improvement to 20/20 and complete resolution of the uveal mass.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 83-year-old Caucasian man with a history of a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema (receiving as-needed intravitreal bevacizumab injections in the right eye and advanced open-angle glaucoma with poor vision in the left eye) presented with new vision complaints. Six months earlier at his previous visit, his visual acuity was 20/20 with resolved branch vein occlusion. He described gradual painless loss of a half-moon of central vision in the right eye over a three-month period. Past medical history was pertinent for known recurrent HER2 receptor positive esophageal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and right pleural base as well as poor cardiac and functional status of 24-month duration. He was previously treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions 11 months earlier and completed local radiation to the primary esophageal mass 13 months earlier.\n\n【8】Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/150 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye (normal range 10–25 mm hg). Anterior segment slit lamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Posterior segment examination of the right eye was notable for a 10.5-sq-mm choroidal lesion centered along the inferior temporal arcade extending into the inferior macula with serous retinal detachment of the macula  with no additional lesions noted in either eye. In view of patient’s medical history, the mass was presumed to be choroidal metastasis secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Local and systemic treatment options including proton beam irradiation and immunotherapy were discussed with the assistance of the oncology team. Ultimately, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was selected to treat the lesion to preserve vision and maintain superior quality of life.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) Fundus photo of the right eye demonstrating a large inferior subretinal lesion.

At 15 weeks following initiation of pembrolizumab infusions the patient’s visual acuity improved to 20/20 . The lesion height regressed completely (4.4–0.7 mm) and became hypopigmented .\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Ocular metastases are present in up to 4% of patients with primary gastrointestinal malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, most commonly arising from the lower GI tract and rarely from the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma metastasis represents less than 1% of all choroidal metastatic lesions. Choroidal metastasis can present as a challenging treatment dilemma depending on characteristics of the mass, extent of systemic disease, treatment goals of the patient and availability of treatment modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Date et al. reported an excellent outcome in a patient with recurrent metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil and trastuzumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Other reports of choroidal metastasis of esophageal adenocarcinoma have been treated with external beam irradiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy and enucleation with variable improvement of visual symptoms but inevitable death from the systemic complications of the primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Quality of life is often compromised from these aggressive therapies. Reports of the use of pembrolizumab in patients with secondary choroidal metastasis have been described only in cases with primary cutaneous melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, with no reports of its use in the setting of choroidal metastases associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【16】PD1 expression and ligation to PDL1 in neoplastic cells results in a transduction of signals that allows for evasion of neoplastic cells from T-cell mediated immune response. By blocking this interaction, PD1 inhibitor immunotherapy such as pembrolizumab has become integral in the approach to treating cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors continues to be under investigation, though it has been shown to have less adverse events than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced esophageal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Adverse events from anti-PD-1 therapy are thought to occur via excessive activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, which result in excessive inflammation in normal tissues. In a large meta-analysis of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced gastro-esophageal cancer, no major ocular-specific complaints were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, cases have described inflammatory ocular sequelae of pembrolizumab including serous retinal detachment, choroidal effusion and detachment, and posterior uveitis, including birdshot-like chorioretinopathy and retinal vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one particular case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma without ocular metastasis, after three months of pembrolizumab infusions the patient developed isolated biopsy-confirmed vitreous metastasis that was thought to be caused by pembrolizumab-mediated retinal vascular leakage.\n\n【17】In conclusion, pembrolizumab successfully and rapidly decreased the size of choroidal metastasis, restored vision without any adverse events and improved quality of life. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors offer promising treatment outcomes with improved side effect profile compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our patient demonstrated rapid improvement of lesion size and visual acuity without any adverse events observed at six months of follow-up.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES/FUNDING\n-----------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FROM PATIENT\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient (giving explicit permission for this report).</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:15:48", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:16:34", "cost": 46.562}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:16:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:15:46"}

Morbidity and mortality most commonly occur secondary to pump failure or ventricular arrhythmias; however, a more infrequently seen complication is the formation of mural thrombi. More commonly seen within the left ventricle, thrombi can embolize leading to stroke or end organ infarction. We present the case of a male who presented with decompensated heart failure. The presence of biventricular thrombi was found on echocardiography and subsequent cross-sectional imaging revealed these had embolized resulting in the rare complication of extensive abdominal aortic thrombosis with renal and testicular infarction. Biventricular thrombi are rare but high risk due to the potential for embolization as demonstrated in this case. Prompt recognition and management with anti-coagulation are essential, followed by treatment of the underlying pathology, which resulted in the formation of thrombi to prevent recurrence.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heart failure is an epidemic resulting in significant health care expenditure and morbidity for patients. Mural thrombus is a rare complication most commonly seen in the left ventricle (LV) following anterior myocardial infarction. Biventricular thrombi have been infrequently described; we present a case of biventricular thrombi resulting in extensive embolization and end organ infarction.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male smoker presented with exertional dyspnoea and scrotal swelling, without testicular pain, on a background of hypertension and excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was consistent with decompensated heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure, anasarca, peripheral and scrotal oedema.\n\n【6】Initial blood tests revealed an N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level of 27 594 pg/ml (<400 pg/ml) with deranged liver and renal biochemistry including an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 2266 u/l (<50 u/l) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 35 ml/min (>90 ml/min). Echocardiogram confirmed LV systolic impairment with an ejection fraction of 10%, moderately dilated LV and right ventricular (RV) cavities and severe functional mitral regurgitation. In addition, apical thromboses were present in the LV and RV .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram. ( **a** ) Focused RV view with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow). ( **b** ) Two-chamber view of the LV with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow).</u>\n\n【8】Given the presentation of gross peripheral oedema, scrotal oedema and deranged ALT, a post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude metastatic disease, specifically liver metastases. The CT study confirmed biventricular dilatation and apical thromboses . No evidence of malignancy or metastatic disease was demonstrated; however, important incidental findings included extensive occlusive abdominal aortic thrombus, which extended from the level of the superior mesenteric artery into the distal external iliac arteries where there was re-opacification of the vessels .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT chest demonstrating biventricular apical thrombi (white arrow—RV thrombus, black arrow—left ventricular thrombus).

( **c** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the left kidney in keeping with infarction (Arrow). ( **d** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally in keeping with infarction ( <sup>* </sup> ).</u>\n\n【10】The left renal artery was completely occluded with reduced enhancement of the left kidney, consistent with infarction . The inferior mesenteric artery was also occluded at its origin although there was distal opacification and normal mucosal enhancement of the colon was preserved. In addition, there was reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally with occlusion of the testicular arteries .\n\n【11】Given the history of excessive alcohol consumption, this was presumed to be the most likely aetiology of the patient’s heart failure which subsequently resulted in the formation of biventricular thrombi leading to embolic extensive aortic thrombosis. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was deemed unlikely given the absence of anginal symptoms or ischaemic electrocardiogram changes. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy would be an alternative differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation. An underlying thrombophilia such as anti-phospholipid syndrome accounting for the multiple sites of arterial thrombosis was considered; however, a thrombophilia screen was negative.\n\n【12】A multifaceted management approach to this patient initially included treatment of heart failure with intravenous furosemide infusion and commencement of ramipril. His heart failure medications were further optimized with the addition of eplerenone and ivabradine with good symptomatic benefit. The patient was strongly encouraged to cease further alcohol consumption.\n\n【13】With regards to the extensive aortic thrombosis, a surgical approach was deemed prohibitively high risk given the patient’s poor cardiac function. A percutaneous thrombectomy via the femoral approach was attempted but was unsuccessful, and therefore the patient was managed conservatively with a heparin infusion and subsequently converted to warfarin.\n\n【14】Serum testosterone levels were found to be low at 1.3 nmol/L (7–26 nmol/L) due to testicular infarction, and therefore replacement was commenced. Following improvement in symptoms and renal and liver biochemistry, the patient was discharged on oral diuretics and long-term warfarin therapy with an INR target of 2–3 in keeping with guideline recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Follow-up.\n\nThe patient developed sepsis |$\\\\sim$| 2 months following the initial presentation, from the right femoral access site which was persistently discharging following the previous attempt at femoral thrombectomy. A post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis study was performed to exclude other potential sources of sepsis, confirmed a right groin collection. There was persistent extensive aortic occlusive thrombus as seen previously; however, there was evidence of new collateralization from rectus abdominis and paraspinal arteries filling the external iliac and femoral arteries. The biventricular thrombi had resolved and there was no evidence of propagation of the aortic thrombus or new arterial thrombosis.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】The formation of LV thrombus in the context of cardiomyopathy with LV impairment and reduced ejection fraction is well-documented; however, biventricular thrombosis is a rarer occurrence complicating up to 23.9% of LV thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Biventricular thrombi have been previously reported in the literature complicating acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. The proposed mechanism for ventricular thrombus formation in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy, as in this case, is blood stasis secondary to cavity dilatation and hypokinesis. A hypercoagulable state can also predispose to the formation of biventricular thrombi including conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. A thrombophilia screen should therefore be performed as part of the investigation for biventricular thrombi.\n\n【19】Complications of biventricular thrombi include systemic and pulmonary embolization which can result in significant end-organ damage such as pulmonary emboli, stroke, acute limb ischaemia and visceral ischaemia. Contemporary data suggest an annualized embolism rate of 3.7% despite treatment with anti-coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Ventricular thrombi complicated by such extensive aortic thrombus have not previously been reported in the literature to our knowledge. There was evidence of end-organ damage with left renal infarct and bilateral testicular infarcts. No pulmonary emboli were demonstrated in this case.\n\n【20】A high index of suspicion is required when predisposing factors for the formation of ventricular thrombi exist such as apical hypokinesia particularly following a large anterior myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial investigation of choice and has 35–60% sensitivity and 90% specificity for LV thrombus detection. Although CT has similar detection rates to TTE, delayed enhancement cardiac MRI is the gold standard for LV thrombus detection with 88% sensitivity and 99% specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】There are no guideline recommendations for the treatment of biventricular thrombus. In practice, patients are treated with low molecular weight heparin before being established on oral anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only approved oral anticoagulant for LV thrombus; however, emerging evidence suggests direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in selected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for up to 6 months for treatment of LV thrombus, with duration guided by surveillance TTE and consideration of bleeding risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thrombolysis remains a treatment option, however carries a risk of catastrophic embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thrombectomy should be considered in patients with a larger, more mobile thrombi which carry an increased risk of embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conservative management in the present case with warfarin resulted in the resolution of ventricular thrombi; however, due to persisting aortic thrombus, the decision was made to continue long-term anti-coagulation.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding associated with this case report.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required for this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Saad Ezad.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:02:16", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:07:02", "cost": 286.663}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:07:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:02:16"}

Twelve hours after streptokinase adminstration, the patient developed severe hemoptysis and dyspnea and radiological studies were highly suggestive for acute alveolar hemorrhage. His past medical history is significant for severe chest trauma ten months prior to presentation.

We also discussed the aspects of our patient in comparison with published cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by intra-alveolar bleeding.

Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm of acute anterior STEMI. After appropriate loading of aspirin and clopidogrel, the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and streptokinase 1.5million units was administrated. His chest pain resolved within three hours with minimal response to thrombolytic therapy on electrocardiogram. Unfortunately, rescue-PCI is not available in our country, thus the patient was continued on medical therapy.\n\n【8】His past medical history was significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (treated with bisoprolol 5 mg) and a multiple trauma caused by a car accident ten months ago. His trauma caused seven rib fractures (four in the left, three in the right), pneumothorax, severe lung contusion, three vertebral fractures in the lateral process and hip fracture. He underwent thoracothentesis, vertebral fixation and total hip replacement and was discharged in a good condition with a mild pleural effusion on chest X-ray (CXR) and no pulmonary complaints.\n\n【9】Twelve hours after streptokinase administration, the patient experienced a severe acute hemoptysis, moderate dyspnea, respiratory rate elevation to thirty breath per minute, oxygen saturation drop (97%to 89%) and hemoglobin drop (12.8 mg/dL to 11.2 mg/dL) without any other source of bleeding. Laboratory tests were otherwise normal. He had no hyperthermia or other signs of pneumonia. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral basal to middle crackles without any other signs or symptoms of heart failure. Thus, the patient was initially treated with intravenous furosemide and increasing dose of nitrate without response.\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography revealed hypokinesia in anterior wall and intraventricular septum with a 40% ejection fraction.\n\n【11】Bedside CXR demonstrated the presence of alveolar opacities involving the central portion of the lungs, particularly in the middle and lower lobes with mild pleural effusion, which directed us to the diagnosis of AH. 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[ Figure 1 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Bedside CXR.

The clinical course of the disease have a wide spectrum from asymptomatic mild cases to abrupt fetal cases of severe respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of revascularization of acute STEMI when P-PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The main considerations of these agents remain the bleeding risk and allergic reactions. Bleeding is reported to occur in (0.2–5.9%) of patient; mainly from puncture sites, visceral cavities as gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum and intracranial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, the unavailability of P-PCI and other thrombolytic agents, makes streptokinase the only thrombolytic method in our country.\n\n【21】Chang YC et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> retrospectively reviewed 2634 patients with acute STEMI who received thrombolytic therapy and reported that hemoptysis has occurred in 11 patients (0.4%). However, frank AH is an extremely rare entity. Ben Murad et al review of the English medical literature revealed only 22 patients until date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Surprisingly all 23 patients (including ours) were males, which posted the male gander as a predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Moreover, streptokinase was the thrombolytic agent in 16 out of 23 patients (69.5%). This can be contributed to the non-specificity of thrombolysis that is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in comparison with other specific fibrinolytic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, the immune reactions of streptokinase that varies from simple allergy to anaphylactic shock can be a contributing factor. It was suggested that immune-mediated capillaritis could be a possible etiology of AH following streptokinase administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. According to Ben Murad review, only five fetal cases out of 23 cases were reported with a mortality rates of 21.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hammoudeh et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported a similar case of a unilateral AH in a patient with an ipsilateral chest trauma two years prior to the infarction.

A possible etiology might be fibrinolysis state against any hemostating clot disassembling any bleeding from site of recent vascular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The main differential diagnosis of post-thrombolytic AH is acute pulmonary edema due to either heart failure or mechanical complications, which can delay the diagnosis as in our patient. Differential diagnosis also includes thromboembolism, pneumonia and autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Treatment options include both conservative management with respiratory support and blood transfusion; and causative management by withdrawal of all antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and, in severe cases the administration of tranexamic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】DECLARATION\n-----------\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding for this article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mardenli M was responsible for conception, critical revision of the manuscript for content and supervision.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ghabally M was responsible for conception, design, acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Horo B was responsible for critical revision of the manuscript, acquisition and design.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Alkhatib Q has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Raee M has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors reviewed and contributed to the final version of this case report.

His past medical history is significant for severe chest trauma ten months prior to presentation. Conservative therapy in addition to anti-coagulants withdrawal has led to gradual improvement in the next six days. We also discussed the aspects of our patient in comparison with published cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by intra-alveolar bleeding. AH usually presents with anemia, hemoptysis, and dyspnea that can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of revascularization in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are not eligible for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, it is associated with a non-negligible risk of bleeding involving the visceral organs such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, vascular access sites and intracranial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】AH following thrombolytic therapy is an extremely rare entity that has only been reported in 22 patients through the medical literature.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 64-year old Caucasian male presented to our emergency department with a compliant of 6-hour retrosternal constricting chest pain with nausea and diaphoresis. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm of acute anterior STEMI. After appropriate loading of aspirin and clopidogrel, the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and streptokinase 1.5million units was administrated. His chest pain resolved within three hours with minimal response to thrombolytic therapy on electrocardiogram. Unfortunately, rescue-PCI is not available in our country, thus the patient was continued on medical therapy.\n\n【8】His past medical history was significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (treated with bisoprolol 5 mg) and a multiple trauma caused by a car accident ten months ago. His trauma caused seven rib fractures (four in the left, three in the right), pneumothorax, severe lung contusion, three vertebral fractures in the lateral process and hip fracture. He underwent thoracothentesis, vertebral fixation and total hip replacement and was discharged in a good condition with a mild pleural effusion on chest X-ray (CXR) and no pulmonary complaints.\n\n【9】Twelve hours after streptokinase administration, the patient experienced a severe acute hemoptysis, moderate dyspnea, respiratory rate elevation to thirty breath per minute, oxygen saturation drop (97%to 89%) and hemoglobin drop (12.8 mg/dL to 11.2 mg/dL) without any other source of bleeding. Laboratory tests were otherwise normal. He had no hyperthermia or other signs of pneumonia. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral basal to middle crackles without any other signs or symptoms of heart failure. Thus, the patient was initially treated with intravenous furosemide and increasing dose of nitrate without response.\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography revealed hypokinesia in anterior wall and intraventricular septum with a 40% ejection fraction.\n\n【11】Bedside CXR demonstrated the presence of alveolar opacities involving the central portion of the lungs, particularly in the middle and lower lobes with mild pleural effusion, which directed us to the diagnosis of AH. 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[ Figure 1 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Bedside CXR.

On day six, CXR demonstrated normal lung fields. On day seven, the patient was discharged home on aspirin mono-antiplatelet therapy taking into consideration the bilateral nature, severe chest trauma, and thus a potential risk of recurrence.\n\n【15】Follow-up of the patient for sixty days was uneventful and coronary angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the left anterior\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest Computerized Tomography.

The clinical course of the disease have a wide spectrum from asymptomatic mild cases to abrupt fetal cases of severe respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of revascularization of acute STEMI when P-PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The main considerations of these agents remain the bleeding risk and allergic reactions. Bleeding is reported to occur in (0.2–5.9%) of patient; mainly from puncture sites, visceral cavities as gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum and intracranial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, the unavailability of P-PCI and other thrombolytic agents, makes streptokinase the only thrombolytic method in our country.\n\n【21】Chang YC et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> retrospectively reviewed 2634 patients with acute STEMI who received thrombolytic therapy and reported that hemoptysis has occurred in 11 patients (0.4%). However, frank AH is an extremely rare entity. Ben Murad et al review of the English medical literature revealed only 22 patients until date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Surprisingly all 23 patients (including ours) were males, which posted the male gander as a predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Moreover, streptokinase was the thrombolytic agent in 16 out of 23 patients (69.5%). This can be contributed to the non-specificity of thrombolysis that is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in comparison with other specific fibrinolytic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, the immune reactions of streptokinase that varies from simple allergy to anaphylactic shock can be a contributing factor. It was suggested that immune-mediated capillaritis could be a possible etiology of AH following streptokinase administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. According to Ben Murad review, only five fetal cases out of 23 cases were reported with a mortality rates of 21.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hammoudeh et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported a similar case of a unilateral AH in a patient with an ipsilateral chest trauma two years prior to the infarction. Taking into consideration that the trauma of our patient was bilateral. We believe that the severe trauma of our patient might have been a contributing factor of the AH. A possible etiology might be fibrinolysis state against any hemostating clot disassembling any bleeding from site of recent vascular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The main differential diagnosis of post-thrombolytic AH is acute pulmonary edema due to either heart failure or mechanical complications, which can delay the diagnosis as in our patient. Differential diagnosis also includes thromboembolism, pneumonia and autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Treatment options include both conservative management with respiratory support and blood transfusion; and causative management by withdrawal of all antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and, in severe cases the administration of tranexamic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】DECLARATION\n-----------\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding for this article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mardenli M was responsible for conception, critical revision of the manuscript for content and supervision.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ghabally M was responsible for conception, design, acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Horo B was responsible for critical revision of the manuscript, acquisition and design.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Alkhatib Q has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Raee M has contributed in acquisition, drafting and interpretation of data.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors reviewed and contributed to the final version of this case report.

Our case report shows VZV reactivation following rituximab treatment in AAV patients. The recombinant zoster vaccine should be recommended before the start of induction treatment with rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels. AAV includes microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It may present with extrarenal manifestations with or without kidney involvement. Glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab for new-onset AAV are recommended as initial therapy. Although rituximab has been used for over a decade to treat AAV, there may be infectious complications during treatment.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 78-year-old woman had myeloperoxidase AAV and used a combination of induction regimens that incorporated oral cyclophosphamide and oral glucocorticoids. Due to refractory disease, she received remission induction therapy with three courses of rituximab. However, multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome after administration of the three courses of rituximab . She was diagnosed with a herpes zoster infection. After treatment with oral valacyclovir, significant remission of the background erythema with a gradual drying out of the old vesicles was noted after 5 days of antiviral therapy .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Significant remission of background erythema with gradual drying out of old vesicles after 5 days of antiviral therapy.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Patients with AAV have higher mortality than the general population despite advances in treatment. The majority of deaths within the first year are attributed to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with respiratory infection being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Wegener’s Granulomatosis Etanercept Trial, the annual incidence of herpes zoster in AAV patients was 4.5 events per 100 patient-years, which is higher than that in the general population (0.4 events per 100 patient-years; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>).\n\n【10】Rituximab—an anti-CD20 B-cell-depleting agent—has emerged as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in AAV. A single-center observational study that included 53 patients with refractory granulomatosis, with polyangiitis treated with at least two courses of rituximab, revealed 30 infections that required antimicrobial therapy and four herpes zoster infections during the follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Another cohort study that included 64 patients with life-threatening AAV treated with a combination regimen (a treatment protocol that included rituximab, low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, low-dose oral glucocorticoids and plasma exchange) revealed four herpes zoster infections during the 3-year follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A French multicenter retrospective study that included 98 adult patients with glomerular disease who received rituximab between June 2000 and October 2011 revealed four cases of herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Antibodies are involved in preventing herpes zoster reactivation. Their functional mechanisms include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, inhibition of cell-to-cell transmission and neutralization of the cell-free virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. After treatment with rituximab alone, the duration of B-cell depletion is ~6–9 months and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia may develop in a subset of adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Because the risk for herpes zoster is increased in patients with AAV following rituximab treatment, we should be aware of primary prophylaxis among these patients. Some experts have suggested zoster vaccination for patients aged 50 years or older who are receiving rituximab for non-malignant immune-mediated hematologic disorders. Recombinant zoster vaccine is preferred over zoster vaccine live 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, for live attenuated vaccine should be administered at least 4 weeks before immunosuppressive therapy, it limits the use for AAV, especially in the emergency setting.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to express my appreciation to Dr Wei-Hung Lin for his valuable suggestions during the development of this research and for comments that greatly improved the manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Wei-Hung Lin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:01:47", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:02:02", "cost": 15.79}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:02:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:01:45"}

We present an unusual case of a 37-year-old male presenting with neurologic signs of right parietal lobe infarction with evidence of vertebral artery dissection and persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomosis as a conduit for thromboembolism.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Stroke in the young goes against all expectation as its occurrence is more fitting for the more aged population. Cervical artery dissection, described as the splitting of the arterial wall of the carotid or vertebral artery, accounts for up to 20% of stroke in the young 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Vertebral artery dissections present half as many times as internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections with an annual incidence rate of 0.97 versus 1.72 per 100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both young and aged populations present with local symptoms of occipital headache and neck pain. However, they are exclusively different in neurological signs and symptoms with respect to the cerebral territories they supply. It is unusual for anterior circulation infarction to occur from a posterior circulation lesion, but is possible through an aberrant carotid-basilar anastomosis. As a result, the patient presents with features of vertebral artery embolism and dissection. There is only one case reported in the medical literature indicating an association with vertebral artery dissection in the presence of persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but there was no associated anterior circulation infarct. We report a patient with a right parietal ischemic infarct secondary to a left vertebral artery dissection and right PPTA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old right-handed Indo-Trinidadian male was accepted into the emergency department with acute left-sided weakness with numbness of left upper limb, sudden loss of consciousness, dizziness, dysphasia and blurred vision within 2 h of the onset of these symptoms. The patient had no medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart disease, immunocompromised states, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders or illicit drug use. Family history is positive for myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus. The history of most recent event was one of being seated at rest when there was a sudden onset of the presenting symptoms. There was no violent coughing nor sneezing, chiropractic activity, no trauma to the cervical spine nor falls.\n\n【6】He was conscious with no hemodynamic instability including systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats/min and temperature of 36.4°C. Neurological assessment revealed dysarthria, left-sided hemiparesis, loss of two-point discrimination in left upper extremity and right-sided facial paralysis. Review of other systems demonstrated no clinical significance. Laboratory findings on presentation included HbA1c 5.1%, fasting glucose 95 mg/dL, cholesterol 188 mg/dL (desirable < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides 110 mg/dL (normal < 150 mg/dL), High-Density Lipoprotein 31 mg/dL (40–60 mg/dL), Low-Density Lipoprotein 102 (<100 mg/dL), Cholesterol 135 mg/dL (50–160 mg/dL), Very Low-Density Lipoprotein 22 mg/dL (0–38 mg/dL), risk ratio 6.1(low 3.0, average 5.0, high 13.0). Coagulation screen: partial thromboplastin time 30.1 (control 30.1 s), prothrombin time 11.1 (control 11.6), International Normalized Ratio 0.95. Cardiac triage: creatine kinase-MB 10.00 (0.00–16.00 U/L), troponin T < 50 ng/L (acute myocardial infarction NOT LIKELY). Myoglobin 32.0 (16–76 ng/ml). Autoimmune screen: cardiolipin Ig (immunoglobulin) A 4.78 (negative < 15APL, cardiolipin IgG 2.31 (< 10 GPL), cardiolipin IgM 1.32 (negative < 15 MPL), ANA IgG 0.05 (<0.9 no detectable ANA IgG by ELISA). Hematology: platelets 256 (150–410 ×103/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), hemoglobin 15.3 (13–17 g/dL), hematocrit 45 (40–50%), low mean corpuscular volume 79 (83–101 fl). Factor V Leiden 2.57 (ratio 2.18–3.38), fibrinogen 4.09 (3.08–6.13 g/L), lupus anticoagulant screen 1.52 (ratio positive > 1.2. C-reactive protein < 5.0 (<10 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 10 (male, 17–50 years ≤ 10 mm/h), protein C 123 (70.0–140.0% activity), elevated protein S 155 (63.0–135.0% activity), antithrombin III 96 (83–128% activity). Biochemistry: creatinine 0.81 (0.66–1.25 mg/dL), serum sodium 145 (135–148 mmol/L), serum potassium (3.8–5.2 mmol/L), mildly elevated serum chloride 110 (95–106 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen 15 (9.0–20.0 mg/dL). D-dimer 0.26 (<0.5 ug/ml), liver profile: elevated globulin 3.7 (2.3–3.5 g/dL). Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography was negative for valvular pathology or thrombus, no pericardial effusion with normal left ventricular wall motion (ejection fraction Simpson: 60%). Also, on presentation at the emergency department, a contrast computerized tomography (CT) of the head and neck showed a right vertebral artery arising from the right subclavian artery, but is small in caliber and does not fully opacify and dissection flap within the right vertebral artery. The left vertebral and common and internal carotid arteries are normal in caliber. A PPTA is present on the right side without associated cerebral aneurysm or vascular malformations noted. The aortic arch is normal in outline. A cerebral axial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed also at the time of presentation to the emergency department demonstrated an area of hyperintensity in the right parietal lobe adjacent to the Sylvian fissure (right middle cerebral artery territory) consistent with clinical findings, a right PPTA and diffuse narrowing of visualized part of the right vertebral artery, possibly hypoplastic . A 3D time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF MRA) on 1.5 Tesla demonstrated crescent sign in left vertebral artery indicating dissection , and PPTA between right ICA and distal basilar artery with normal diameter of both ICAs . The patient was anti-coagulated with intravenous heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, which resulted in rapid but incomplete resolution of symptoms. This initial anticoagulation was coupled with oral antiplatelet therapy, using aspirin and clopidogrel for the purpose of long-term administration. On follow-up, a repeat contrast MRI 10 days later demonstrated a hypoplastic right vertebral artery. In addition, a color duplex ultrasonogram of vertebral arteries demonstrated a flow-dependent flap seen on cardiac cycling along the intra-foraminal left vertebral artery. Clinically, at this 1-week post-presentation, he was with full recovery of motor and sensory function on the left side with a subjective assessment of mildly slurred speech. Subsequent follow-up detailed occasional mild neck pains of no subjective concerns regarding occupational hazards. Efforts have been made to review the progress of this patient, but he has been unable to present to the outpatient clinic for even further follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Axial DWI MRI showing hyperintensity in right parietal lobe adjacent to sylvian fissure.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) axial 3D-TOF MRI showing ‘crescent sign’ or dissection of left vertebral artery.

However, the causes are not always well-defined. In contrast to stroke in the elderly, causes are different and rare including illicit drug use, patent foramen ovale, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and cervical artery dissection. Cervical artery dissections are the most common cause of stroke in the young with vertebral artery dissections accounting for half as many as ICA dissections. Vertebral artery dissections are usually due to extrinsic factors such as trauma, whiplash accidents in motor vehicular accidents, direct hit, medical procedures and strangulation. Numerous reports have described rare etiologies including minor injuries from coughing, vomiting, violent sneezing, sports, roller coaster rides or chiropractic manipulation. Spontaneous dissections are also reported in those with underlying arteriopathy, such as connective tissue diseases or fibromuscular dysplasia. Due its low incidence rate, however, this may very well be also attributed to presumed minor injuries.\n\n【12】Vertebral artery dissections typically present with occipital headache, neck pain or vertigo, with some experiencing ischemic manifestations such as posterior circulation syndromes including lateral medullary syndrome—dysphagia, dizziness, vertigo, Horner’s syndrome, nystagmus. However, due to the presentation of anterior circulation infarct in this patient, cervical artery dissection as an etiology seems highly unlikely. However, in this patient, there was no clear evidence to support a hematological, inflammatory, traumatic, nor metabolic cause via the anterior circulation. After ruling out other causes of stroke in the young, imaging also revealed a PPTA that anastomoses the distal basilic artery to the right ICA. This anastomosis provides a potential conduit for emboli from the vertebral artery dissection resulting in an anterior circulation stroke instead of a typical posterior circulation stroke.\n\n【13】PPTA is the most common and largest of the primitive carotid-basilar anastomoses that persist into adulthood with a prevalence of 0.1% and 0.68% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Other persistent primitive anastomoses include the primitive otic (acoustic) artery, the primitive hypoglossal artery and the primitive proatlantal artery. There have been infrequent reports cases of these anastomoses implicated in multi-territorial infarcts attributed to their role as conduits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】To the best of our experience, this is the first report of vertebral artery dissection and anterior circulation stroke secondary to embolism through PPTA.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All individuals in this report have made exceptional contributions.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgment for funding has been identified.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required in this instance.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Received and available if requested.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Dale A.

Early recognition and prompt management with tick removal helps in complete recovery. If untreated, ascending paralysis can lead to respiratory failure and death in 10% of the cases. Tick paralysis is usually considered as a differential in all cases of acute ataxia and generalized weakness in children and adults but seldom in neonates due to its rarity and differences in clinical presentation in the newborn period. In neonates, tick paralysis may present only as generalized weakness and lethargy with poor feeding. Even though tick paralysis is common in children <10 years of age, it has never been reported in a neonate. We report a case of tick bite paralysis in a baby who presented in the neonatal period, and identification of the tick and its removal that helped in rapid recovery.\n\n【2】neonatology , infectious diseases\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Tick paralysis is caused by nearly over 40 species of ticks worldwide and can occur in almost any region where ticks are found. Tick paralysis in humans is rare and usually occurs in children under the age of 10, but has never been reported in the early neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Tick paralysis occurs when an engorged and gravid (egg-laden) female tick injects the neurotoxin present in its saliva into the host during feeding. Tick paralysis is toxin induced and therefore continues only in its presence. Once the tick is removed, symptoms usually diminish rapidly. However, in some cases, profound paralysis can develop and even become fatal if a tick’s presence is missed and not completely removed. The tick bites are most often found at the head and often at the hair lines behind the ears and in the skin folds. The clinical presentation may start between 2 and 7 days after the bite and appears as typical ascending flaccid paralysis in children and poor feeding and/or lethargy in neonates. After a prodromal phase, neurological symptoms begin with paralysis of the lower extremities along with weak/absent deep tendon reflexes. Paralysis progresses over few hours to a day to involve the upper extremities, cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. If the tick is not identified, located and removed it may lead to death due to respiratory failure. Sensory findings are generally absent and therefore form an important differential diagnosis in motor neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, infant botulism and diphtheria. In tick bites mental status is typically normal and fever is absent.\n\n【6】Tick bites in early neonatal period have never been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. We describe the first case of tick paralysis in the early neonatal period.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A male baby was delivered in a primary health center at term gestation via normal vaginal delivery and weighed 2.5 kg. He cried at birth, did not require any resuscitation and was discharged on Day 2 of life. On Day 3 he was diagnosed with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 20.6 mg/dl and direct bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dl) and hence was referred to our center. We started intensive phototherapy. He was discharged on Day 5 of life with normal bilirubin levels (total bilirubin: 9.6 mg/dl and direct bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dl). On Day 9 of life parents brought the newborn to our center with complaints of poor feeding, lethargy and reduced activity since 6 h, and with yellowish discoloration of hands and legs since 2 days. On examination it was found that the baby was hemodynamically stable (heart rate: 120 beats per minute, peripheral pulses: well felt, capillary refill time: <3 s and warm peripheries) with normoglycemia (Random blood sugar: 98 mg/dl) and normal body temperature (36.6°C). Icterus was noted till knees and elbows with no evidence of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND). Neurological examination showed drowsiness and lethargy. Glasgow Coma Scale score was nine (eye opening on pain, withdrawing from pain and crying to pain). Pupils were equal and reactive. Anterior fontanelle was level with normal cry. Poor latching and sucking was noted. Generalized hypotonia of all four limbs was noted with a poor respiratory effort. Deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive. No seizures or neck retractions were noted. No cranial nerve deficits were noted.\n\n【9】Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin: 15.8 gm/%, total count: 7300 cells/cumm, differential count: neutrophils (63%), lymphocytes (37%), platelet count: 2.9 lakh/cumm, C-reactive protein: 0.5 mg/l, total bilirubin: 12 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 0.4 mg/dl, sodium: 138 mEq/l, potassium: 4.8 mEq/l, total protein: 5.5 gm/dl, albumin: 3.5 gm/dl, AST: 50u/l, ALT: 36 u/l and GRBS: 98 mg/dl.\n\n【10】We admitted the baby to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where a re-examination was done. An engorged tick was found attached under the chin of the baby. The tick was removed by grasping it with forceps close to the body and pulling it out with steady upward outward pressure. No part of the tick was left behind. The tick was found to be of Haemaphysalis species which is common in this area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. With the removal of the tick, the baby improved dramatically within few hours. We started maintenance fluids until breast feeding was re-established. Although incidence of Lyme disease is low in India, we initiated a prophylactic dose of amoxicillin for 14 days. Baby was discharged after 3 days of in-patient care and was kept on follow-up since incidence of Kyasanur Forest disease is high in our region. Kyasanur forest disease is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to south-western part of India. On follow-up after 2 weeks the baby was doing well and gaining weight.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Studies carried out by Prakasan _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> suggested Haemaphysalis species belonging to the ixodes tick genus is the most prevalent among domestic animals in Wayand district of Kerala. Signs and symptoms of tick paralysis have generally been described in older children and adults and never in a neonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 5 \\]</u>. A recent case report by John _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> identified an ixodes tick in a 4-year-old child with eyelid swelling. The symptoms usually begin with fatigue, poor feeding and lethargy. Ascending paralysis rapidly progresses within hours to 1 day to involve the upper extremities, cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. If the tick is not removed in time, it can be fatal due to respiratory failure. Sensory changes are typically rare and the mental status is normal. Fever is typically absent. There is no toxin assay and imaging is normal. Because of these reasons the diagnosis is clinical. Rapid improvement of the patient once the engorged tick is removed should confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves simply removing the feeding tick. It is important to remove all the mouthparts, since they contain the salivary glands which may continue to intoxicate the patient even after the main body of the tick has been removed.\n\n【13】Tick bites in neonates mimic clinical signs and symptoms typical of other neonatal infections like fever/hypothermia, irritability and poor feeding. Tick-borne intoxication should therefore be considered when a neonate coming from an endemic region has clinical findings suggesting neonatal infections with normal blood counts. Neuropathies such as Guillian Barre Syndrome, infant botulism and diphtheria should also be ruled out. History of witnessed tick bites and recent family or pet exposures to ticks provide helpful information. Examination findings may reveal diagnostic clues. Variety of skin rash may develop at the bite site. Identification of a tick is typically adequate to diagnose.\n\n【14】Much remains unknown about neonatal tick-borne infections. The signs and symptoms in our patient who presented with a short clinical course, lack of clinically validated tests for tick-borne intoxication (tick toxicosis) in the neonatal period and rapid improvement on removal of the tick tell us about the importance of a thorough clinical examination in similar situations. In presenting this case, we aim to provide guidance to other clinicians.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】As tick-borne infections become more prevalent, we expect other clinicians will face similarly challenging neonatal cases. Providers must use past experience and a keen eye to identify ticks in neonates to rule out other conditions with similar presentation. Delayed diagnosis is detrimental and so early treatment is very necessary to prevent a critical outcome.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES (INCLUDES FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING/SUPPORT\n---------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was secured for this study.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ROLE OF FUNDER/SPONSOR (IF ANY)\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was secured for this study.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION (IF ANY)\n------------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not a clinical trial.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

Histologically, fibromatosis is an abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumours (DTs) are very rare and usually occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This is a report of a rare case of benign DT of the colon presenting as a perforated malignancy and being treated surgically with complete resection.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 51-year-old lady presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized abdominal pain. The patient did not report any associated symptoms. She had had similar episodes in the recent past, but the symptoms were minor and resolved on their own. Her past medical history included a recent admission to ED with renal colic and a computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen which was clear . She did not report any weight loss. The abdominal examination revealed tenderness, mainly in the left side of the abdomen, but no signs of peritonitis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|The CT scan abdomen that patient had 6 months prior to the presentation to the ED with renal colic. ( **A** ) Coronal, ( **B** ) sagittal and ( **C** ) axial. There is no evidence of tumour in the transverse colon.</u>\n\n【8】Blood tests showed a C-reactive protein of 24 mg/l and white blood cells of 12 000/ml. The rest of the values were unremarkable, including lactates. She was tachycardic, but she was haemodynamically stable. Chest X-ray showed no free air under diaphragm. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed free intraperitoneal gas indicating a hollow viscus perforation. A 9.2 × 6.1 cm lesion in the mesentery, which at that time was of uncertain aetiology, was also found. The report mentioned that although the mass was inseparable from the transverse colon superiorly, it did not appear to arise from this and maintained a clear plane to the small bowel loops. The mass was of heterogeneous attenuation measuring up to 50 Hounsfield units. Further review of the scans with the consultant radiologist suggested the presence of a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumour or a desmoid .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT of the abdomen and pelvis preoperatively.

A midline laparotomy was performed and a large tumour was discovered. Its wall was well defined, and it was arising from the wall of the transverse colon. The omentum was covering a part of the tumour that looked necrotic . As the tumour seemed extraluminal and benign, it was decided to proceed with wide resection of the wall of the colon. A linear staple (80 mm) was applied on the transverse colon , and the tumour was removed en bloc with the part of the colonic wall and the omentum that was covering it . The rest of the intraperitoneal cavity was explored for possible deposits or tumours, and it was negative.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The tumour was arising from the antimesenteric border of the transverse colon.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Resection of the tumour with a linear staple (80 mm) that was applied on the transverse colon.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Specimen. Posterior side. En bloc resection of the tumour with the part of the colonic wall and the omentum that was covering it.</u>\n\n【14】The histopathology confirmed benign fibromatosis. Macroscopically, the specimen was described as a 90 × 85 × 60 mm round mass of white tissue with attached omental fat 310 × 170 × 25 mm with no evidence of perforation. Microscopically, a spindle cell lesion composed of fascicles in places with a perpendicular pattern was revealed. The tumour cells showed diffuse nuclear staining for beta catenin and they were negative for S100, CD34, CD117 and desmin. Mitoses were seen scattered and typical in morphology excluding colonic malignancy. It was a margin-negative (R0) resection.\n\n【15】The patient had an uneventful post-operative period. The case was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), and it was decided to continue follow-up with interval scans without chemoradiotherapy. The CT scans 6 and 12 months post-operatively showed no recurrence or signs of metastatic disease or lymphadenopathy.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The word desmoid comes from the Greek word desmos, which means tendon-like 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These are locally aggressive tumours that histopathologically contain of proliferating myofibroblasts which make them solid and tough. They can be classed as extra-abdominal, intra-abdominal and within the abdominal wall. They are more common in the female gender, and evidence suggests that oestrogen levels effect their growth. Although DTs do not metastasize, their recurrence rate is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】We present the first case report in literature describing a DT arising from the transverse colon of a patient who presented with acute abdomen and underwent an emergency laparotomy and wide resection without extended colectomy. There are three case reports in literature describing a colonic DT, one was a finding in an elective and two in an emergency setting, but in all of those cases, patients finally underwent a hemicolectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】DF remains an enigmatic disease with a variable course that can range from an incidental small tumour that can remain small and stable or become large and grow rapidly, causing death in a matter of months or years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our case, there was no evidence seen in the CT scan that was done 6 months prior to the patient’s presentation in the ED. The latter, together with the large size of the tumour (9.2 × 6.1 cm), means that its growth was rapid. Furthermore, DT can become mobile as they are attached or originated from the mesentery. Therefore, a characteristic of the DT of the abdominal cavity is that they can potentially remain asymptomatic for a long period of time before becoming symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】In our case, a colonic DT mimicking a hollow viscus perforation can be anticipated as diagnosis. Even though free intraperitoneal gas had been seen in the CT, no bowel perforation was noted intraoperatively. As the tumour had a necrotic area, covered with omentum, it seems that the gas was originating from the tumour necrosis. Finally, no perforation was described macroscopically in the histopathology report.\n\n【21】The surgical management of gastrointestinal fibromatosis is governed by the location, size and local invasion of the tumour. R0 resection has historically been the gold standard for the treatment of abdominal wall and intra-abdominal DTs; however, microscopically positive margin resection is acceptable, as recurrence rates may not be significantly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, it was a R0 resection with >1 cm margin, and after 1 year, there was no sign of recurrence. It is important that we did not have to proceed with extensive colonic resection and anastomosis. However, the intraoperative decision to proceed with a colectomy or local excision is a challenge. A preoperative and or an intraoperative discussion with a colorectal specialist is ideal even though this is not always feasible in an emergency situation. In case of a doubt or limited experience in colorectal surgery, the operating surgeon should proceed with colectomy in order to ensure negative resection margins.\n\n【22】DT of the colon is a very rare and aggressive type of intra-abdominal DF. Patients with colonic DT can present with a range of symptoms from a mild chronic abdominal pain to those of an acute abdomen. CT is an essential tool for the final diagnosis. The surgeon should review the scans together with the consultant radiologist in order to form the best plan preoperatively and intraoperatively. Complete resection of the tumour with negative margins macroscopically prevents local recurrence. The decision of an extended resection of the involved bowel or just local excision should be made intraoperatively depending on the tumour’s location, local invasion and surgeon’s experience. An MDT discussion, as well as follow-up, is mandatory.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, adrenals and bone. Urethral malignancies are rare, accounting for less than 1% of malignant tumors, and can cause urethral stenosis, which often occurs with dysuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

No previous information was found in literature reporting on urethral metastases secondary to esophageal cancer.

The patient’s medical history was unremarkable. He had been drinking three bottles of beer daily for over 40 years and smoking one to two packs of cigarettes daily for more than 45 years. The patient was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma of the lower thoracic segment based on the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings. At the same time, endoscopy also exposed a superficial hypopharyngeal cancer as a synchronous malignancy. Endoscopic biopsy and histopathology revealed non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography showed multiple pulmonary and liver masses and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. This included the right supraclavicular, mediastinal, paraaortic and right inguinal lymph nodes. Accordingly, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer with distant metastases (cT4aN4M1, stage IVB, according to the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification system 8th edition).\n\n【6】At the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis, the patient also reported voiding difficulties, specifically, a poor stream, terminal dribbling and incomplete voiding. Routine urine tests revealed no traces of blood or protein remnants. The urine red blood cell count was 2.2/HPF and the white blood cell count was 2.6/HPF. Atypical cells were not detected on urine cytology. The patient was referred to a urologist, who performed a cystourethroscopy for a palpable penile lump. Cystourethroscopy revealed a smooth nodular, 5-mm mass in the penile urethra . A transurethral biopsy was then performed. The bladder mucosa was smooth, and there were no notable abnormalities in the left and right urethral openings.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Cystourethroscopy revealed a 5-mm smooth nodular mass in the penile urethra.</u>\n\n【8】Microscopically, the urethral tumor showed abundant nuclear pleomorphism and was identified as a non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the patient underwent chemotherapy with 5-FU and CDDP for metastatic disease. Following treatment, his dysuria was resolved, and he could urinate without discomfort. The follow-up period was ~3 months.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】We have reported a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer. This case highlights two essential findings. First, esophageal cancer can metastasize to the urethra, resulting in voiding difficulties. Second, cystoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool for metastatic urethral tumors.\n\n【13】Esophageal cancer can metastasize to the urethra, and urethral metastatic tumors should be suspected in cancer patients presenting with dysuria. Metastatic tumors of the urethra occur more frequently than primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several reports of metastasis from the colon and rectum, lungs and breast are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>; however, urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer has not previously been reported.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|The esophageal tumor contained moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.</u>\n\n【15】Urethral metastasis was diagnosed by histopathological analysis of the sample obtained via transurethral biopsy. Cystoscopy revealed a smooth nodular mass that did not extend to the surrounding urothelium. Primary urethral tumors commonly extend beyond or above the surface. Moreover, they exhibit a cobbled appearance with a papillary surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, the tumor’s characteristics differed from the typical primary urethral carcinoma. Microscopically, it was diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. The carcinomatous component was negative for GATA-3 and uroplakin II on immunohistochemical analysis. However, these markers were positive on the surface of the normal urothelium surrounding the tumor. GATA-3 and uroplakin II are novel markers for primary urethral carcinoma and are positive in 99 and 80% of malignant urothelial tumors, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The immunohistochemical findings, in this case, indicated metastasis of esophageal cancer to the urethra, and the tumor might have arisen from the stroma, which is beneath the urothelium.\n\n【16】The proposed hypotheses for urethral metastasis include the lymphatic, arterial or venal routes or direct invasion, although direct invasion is anatomically impossible. Kaushal _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported a case of inguinal lymph node metastasis from a gastroesophageal junction carcinoma. The patient had bilateral inguinal lymph node swelling with multiple enlarged paraaortic, iliac and pelvic lymph nodes. The authors hypothesized that metastasis was due to the retrograde flow through paraaortic nodes to the pelvic and inguinal nodes. While our patient had right inguinal node swelling, he did not have pelvic lymph node metastasis; therefore, it is likely that the underlying mechanisms differ. In a study describing unexpected sites of metastases secondary to esophageal cancer, distal isolated metastases via the lymphatic route were scarcely explained. The authors postulated that tumor embolisms pass through the main artery to the distal isolated organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We propose that distal urethral tumors flow into the right inguinal lymph node via the hematologic route. Although inguinal lymph node metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer is rare, we should consider the possibility of a urethral tumor in patients presenting with inguinal lymph node swelling.\n\n【17】Herein, we report a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Despite its rarity, medical oncologists should consider this diagnosis in cancer patients presenting with dysuria.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We want to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None of the authors received any funding for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report was approved by the institute’s Institutional Review Board.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ikumi Kuno is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:01:47", "cost": 66.555}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:01:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:40"}

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by sustained hypereosinophilia associated with end-organ damage. Based on underlying molecular mechanism of eosinophilia, there are different subtypes of HES. Diagnosis of HES subtype can be challenging, especially in the absence of overt lymphoid/myeloid neoplasms or discernable secondary causes. Long-term outpatient follow-up with periodic complete blood count and repeated bone marrow biopsy may be needed to monitor disease activity. Somatic signal transducer and activation transcription 5b (STAT5b) N642H mutation was recently found to be associated with myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia.

We report a case of HES who presented with pulmonary embolism and acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and was found to have recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation by NGS.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 72-year-old Caucasian gentleman without significant past medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring 0.7 FiO <sub>2 </sub> oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula. He was in his usual state of health until 2 weeks earlier when he traveled to CA, where he was briefly hospitalized twice for chest pain, fever and diarrhea. He was diagnosed with ‘type B aortic dissection’, pneumonia and viral gastroenteritis.\n\n【6】He presented to our institute with dry cough and shortness of breath. He was on beta-blocker for recent diagnosis of ‘type B aortic dissection’. On physical examination, he was hypotensive (84/44 mm Hg) without tachycardia (88/min), afebrile, tachypneic (22/min) and hypoxic (SpO <sub>2 </sub> 85% at room air). There were bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. Initial differential diagnosis included aortic pathology, thromboembolism, infection and hematologic disorders. Electrocardiogram and serum troponin were normal. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed marked leukocytosis (50 k/μl) with eosinophilia (4.0 k/μl), thrombocytopenia (82 k/μl) and normal hemoglobin level (15.6 g/dl). Chest X-ray showed mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1a **\\]</u>** . Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography ruled out acute aortic injury, but revealed acute pulmonary embolism in the right middle lobe, patchy peribronchial ground glass opacity, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1b **\\]</u>** . Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs was negative for deep vein thromboses. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. He was given oxygen by high-flow nasal canula, heparin infusion, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and was admitted to the ICU.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(a) Chest X-ray shows bilateral, perihilar mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates simulating pulmonary edema.

Peripheral smear was absent for dysplastic eosinophils. Flow cytometry was negative for a B- or T-cell clonality. Cytogenetic testing of peripheral blood was negative. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple new splenic infarcts without hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1c **\\]</u>** . To confirm eosinophilia-related end-organ injury and rule out infection, diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. It revealed a total nucleated cell count of 663 with significant eosinophilia (86%).

Treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg (60 mg) was initiated. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia responded to prednisone **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 3 **\\]</u>** . Dyspnea improved and the patient was discharged home at room air with prednisone 60 mg daily and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Trending of white blood cell (WBC) and eosinophil counts.</u>\n\n【12】At 2-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with normal WBC (8.4 k/μl) and eosinophil count (0.4 k/μl) **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 3 **\\]</u>** . Prednisone was tapered off at 2.5 months. Repeated CT chest at 6 months revealed complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates. Patient followed with hematology/oncology service every 3 months. He continued to be asymptomatic with excellent performance status and no limitation in daily activities. However, 11 months after hospital discharge, CBC showed gradual worsening erythrocytosis (hemoglobin 18.8 g/dl and hematocrit 56%) with low serum erythropoietin level, and increase in eosinophils (3.2 k/μl). Bone marrow biopsy with NGS for myeloid mutation panel was performed at 4 months and 11 months post discharge. It revealed recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation and ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutation. Although no overt myeloid neoplasm was found, given reported association of STAT5b N642H mutation with myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, the working diagnosis evolved toward myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia. To control worsening erythrocytosis and eosinophilia, hydroxyurea 500 mg once daily was started. Cell counts subsequently improved. Given the inability to rule out myeloid neoplasm, patient was committed to long-term anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】HES with lung involvement can present as acute eosinophilic pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The radiographic manifestations can resemble pulmonary edema in the active phase with bilateral areas of ground glass opacity and smooth interlobular septal thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Persistent eosinophil infiltrates in the lungs can lead to intraluminal fibrosis that resembles organizing pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. HES is a hypercoagulable disorder. Thromboembolism, both arterial and venous thrombosis, is a common complication of HES and can be life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Recently, NGS targeting genes that are known to be associated with myeloid neoplasms have been increasingly applied to patients with idiopathic HES, especially when a clonal eosinophilia is suspected, but conventional cytogenetic testing is negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Frequently detected mutations by NGS are genes involving DNA methylation and chromatin modification, such as TET2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These mutations have also been frequently found in elderly general population (affecting about 10% of persons older than 70 years of age) and are associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus the detection of such mutations needs to be interpreted in the context of other clinical and pathological findings when establishing a diagnosis of clonal hypereosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Recurrent somatic activating STAT5b N642H mutation was recently found in seven cases of idiopathic HES and 20 cases of myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Mutated STAT5b N642H causes enhanced stability of STAT5b dimerization with alteration of downstream gene expression profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The overall survival of STAT5b-mutated idiopathic HES cases was only 30 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, compared with previously reported 87% of 5-year survival in a cohort of 98 patients with idiopathic HES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of STAT5b N642H mutation in patients with HES.\n\n【16】In summary, we reported a case of HES with recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation, suggesting possible underlying myeloid neoplasm. We highlighted the importance of long-term follow-up for disease monitoring in patients with HES.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to our patient for giving us written permission to publish this case report.

We describe a rare case of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the neck and the node surrounding the cystic duct of the gallbladder. A 33-year-old female presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain aggravated after fat meals. The diagnosis was made as chronic cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Pathologic examination showed a lobulated nodule connected to the cystic duct. Microscopically, this node consisted of all components of pancreatic tissue. Localization of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gallbladder is exceedingly rare. Less than 40 cases of heterotopic pancreas in the gallbladder have been reported worldwide. The ectopic pancreas is an extraordinary congenital entity. Although pancreatic tissue in the lymph node is an exceptional finding, pathologists should be aware of it because it may be confused with tumor or metastasis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heterotopic pancreas (HP), also referred to as an ectopic pancreas, pancreatic rest and accessory pancreatic tissue is defined as the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue in an anatomic place with no communication with the main pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

The gallbladder is a very rare location that is involved by pancreatic rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The ectopic pancreas is usually an incidental and asymptomatic finding, but it may be present with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. In this report, we present a case of HP in the neck of the gallbladder and around its cystic duct.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\nA 33-year-old female presented to the emergency department at Tishreen University Hospital in 2021 with repeated attacks of right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the back and right shoulder and worsened by fatty meals. These symptoms persisted for 2 months before her admission to our hospital. The patient was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She had no previous surgery or allergy to any drugs. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the right upper quadrant with a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, WBC of 5.1 mm <sup>3 </sup> , serum amylase of 74 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–140)</u> and blood glucose of 85 mg/dL. Her liver and renal function tests revealed no abnormality. Abdomen ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and multiple gallstones in the lumen, the largest was 4.7 mm in diameter . Depending on the diagnosis of chronic calculous cholecystitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done. On pathological examination, the gallbladder measured 7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter with a wall thickness |$\\\\sim$| of 0.5 cm. The serosa was unremarkable. Gross inspection of the excised gallbladder showed a firm mass surrounding the cystic duct measuring 1.2 cm. After opening the specimen, another mass was found in the serosa of the neck region about 0.5 cm in diameter. Cut sections revealed well-circumscribed, yellow and lobulated nodules . The mucosa was intact, green and velvety. The H&E-stained sections showed an ectopic pancreatic tissue in the large mass, composed of lobules of exocrine pancreatic acini, ducts  and islets of Langerhans . On the other hand, only acini were seen in the serosa of the gallbladder . The apical area of acinar cells contained eosinophilic granules, whereas the basal region is markedly basophilic. Residual lymphatic tissue in the lymph node was not seen. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the same day, without any complications.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|An ultrasonographic image of the gallbladder showed wall thickening with multiple gallstones in the lumen.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Gross image of the excised gallbladder, cut section revealed a well-circumscribed, yellow nodule in the area of the cystic duct (black arrow) and a similar small nodule in the neck region of the gallbladder (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Microscopic images of the gallbladder.

HP can be occurred anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent locations are the stomach, duodenum and jejunum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. By contrast, the presence of ectopic pancreas in the esophagus, gallbladder, mesentery, spleen, mediastinum or fallopian tubes is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the gallbladder is an extremely rare site for the HP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The first reported case of HP in the gallbladder dates back to 1916 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Until the present study, >40 cases of HP in the gallbladder have been reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In most patients, this condition is an incidental finding on upper endoscopy or laparotomy and it is generally asymptomatic. However, it may be complicated by inflammation, bleeding, obstruction or malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The differential diagnosis of the enlargement of cystic duct lymph node includes cholecystitis, tuberculosis, ectopic tissue and lymphoma or metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our first diagnosis was reactive lymphadenopathy in context of chronic cholecystitis. The microscope examination showed ectopic pancreatic tissue with no residual lymphatic tissue. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of HP; the most widely accepted is that the tissue is separated from the pancreas gland during the rotation of the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The literature reported one case of HP in four lymph nodes around the common hepatic artery. The pathogenesis of HP in the lymph node is unclear. Two possibilities have been proposed; a failure during embryologic development or lymphatic migration of epithelial elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ectopic pancreatic tissue is usually located in the neck or fundus of the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Preoperative diagnosis is rarely clinically or radiologically possible because it is a very rare pathological entity, which diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, in addition to the neck, it has also been found in the cystic duct lymph node, which is considered a very exceptional site. Histologically, the ectopic pancreas can be complete heterotopia, similar to the normal pancreas, composed of exocrine acini, duct and islets of Langerhans, or incomplete heterotopia if the endocrine elements were absent. Based on microscopic findings, HP has been classified into three types by von Heinrich in 1909. Type 1: all components of pancreatic tissue (acini, ducts and islets of Langerhans) are present; Type 2: contains only a few acini and ducts, but lacks endocrine elements; Type 3: only proliferating excretory ducts with the absence of acini and islets cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. According to what was mentioned above, our case was considered to be complete heterotopia and Type 1 of the Heinrich classification.\n\n【11】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【12】Pancreatic heterotopia is an exceptional event especially when it is localized to the gallbladder. Although HP in the lymph node is unusual, pathologists should be aware of it because it may mimic tumor or metastasis.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required for this case report.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rabab Salloum.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:37:46", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:38:24", "cost": 38.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:35", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:38:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:37:46"}

Many complications due to COVID-19 have been reported, even after discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, hyperlipoproteinemia combined with COVID-19 has not yet been reported; moreover, steroid therapy for COVID-19 can induce hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of severe hypertriglyceridemia >5000 mg/dl triglyceride (TG) appearing after COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We herein report a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonia combined with severe hypertriglyceridemia based on a TG level >8000 mg/dl, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 55-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for fever, cough, headache and taste disorder 6 days prior. She had a medical history of hypertriglyceridemia. She had increased her alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic since 2019, and treatment with 0.2 mg of pemafibrate was started because her TG levels had increased to ~700 mg/dl at 1 month before admission. However, lipid-lowering therapy was stopped by a local doctor due to the appearance of symptoms. There was no remarkable family history. Her vital signs on admission revealed a high-grade fever of 38.6°C and hypoxemia requiring oxygen at 2 l/min via nasal cannula. Physical examination did not show abnormal findings. The laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count of 3390 cells/μl; C-reactive protein level of 9.23 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 78 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 50 IU/l and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 5.9%. A positive result was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction using posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multifocal bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Chest CT scans showed multifocal bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n【7】Accordingly, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with 60 mg of methylprednisolone, remdesivir and heparin. Her symptoms and radiographic findings improved gradually; however, the improvement was slow, and her radiological abnormalities remained on Day 10 of hospitalization. Therefore, steroids were not stopped on Day 10 of hospitalization, and the dose of steroids was decreased. Taste disorder remained after discharge, and she consumed excessive alcohol and a larger amount of food. At 32 days after the appearance of her initial symptoms, the blood sample appeared lipemic on 5 mg of prednisolone, and laboratory findings showed the following: TG level of 8750 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 192 mg/dl, AST level of 106 IU/l, ALT level of 134 IU/l, amylase level of 50 U/l, lipase level of 36 IU/l and HbA1c level of 6.3%. Her thyroid function was normal, and antinuclear antibody was negative. Electrophoresis of the lipoproteins showed that the proportion of alpha was 9.3% (normal range: 20.4–46.4%), that of preβ was 41.8% (normal range: 3.8–33.8%), that of β was 25.6% (normal range: 36.5–59.1%) and that of the origin was 23.3%, which showed the presence of chylomicrons and an increase in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. The apolipoprotein fraction indicated concentrations of apolipoprotein B of 186 mg/dl, C-II of 47.5 mg/dl, C-III of 55.1 mg/dl and E of 32.2 mg/dl, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) levels decreased to 50 mg/dl. The phenotype of apolipoprotein E was E3/2. The patient was thus diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. She did not have any symptoms of pancreatitis, and her TG levels were decreased by restriction of fat intake and sobriety.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】We herein report a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonia with severe hypertriglyceridemia, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. Generally, Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, which is a rare form of severe hypertriglyceridemia characterized by increasing VLDL and chylomicronemia, is caused by a genetic disorder or environmental factors such as heavy drinking and autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Regardless, she did not have a remarkable familial history, and the cause of Type V hyperlipoproteinemia was unknown. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for the development of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>; therefore, changes in TGs should be observed carefully in patients after resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【10】One of the reasons for hyperlipoproteinemia progression might be the interruption of lipid-lowering therapy. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia in patients with COVID-19 is 26%, and lipid parameters, including TG levels, often decrease in the presence of cytokine-mediated inflammation as a consequence of the acute phase response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is suggested that lipid-lowering therapy should not be stopped for patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, considering the slow progression of hyperlipoproteinemia until admission, it was thought that steroid therapy, complications of COVID-19 and/or lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with hyperlipoproteinemia progression in this case.\n\n【11】TG levels are influenced by several medications, such as steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, which are used for COVID-19 treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A previous study demonstrated that TG levels were increased in the long term to 156 ± 54 mg/dl by prednisolone treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Some patients have TG levels > 1000 mg/dl, which is caused by corticosteroids, although none have TG levels > 2200 mg/dl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is suggested that steroid therapy alone cannot increase TG levels to >8000 mg/dl. Furthermore, for patients with COVID-19, corticosteroids reduce 28-day mortality and are usually applied in the short term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient stopped steroid therapy on Day 39 through a decrease in dose. Accordingly, the cause of the increased TG level in our patient might be not only a side effect of corticosteroids but also other environmental factors.\n\n【12】Her alcohol consumption and amount of food intake increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 4-fold declaration of a state of emergency in Tokyo, Japan, starting in April 2020. In general, people worldwide have had to stay at home and practice social distancing during the pandemic, and lifestyle changes are related to body weight gain and alcohol consumption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Alcohol with plasma TG metabolism leads to hypercholesterolemia in a complex interplay with partially altered LPL activity, often with a genetically predisposed background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Moreover, she consumed alcohol excessively and a larger amount of food because of taste disorder as a COVID-19 complication after discharge. Accordingly, it is important to understand the changes in the patient’s lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after the resolution of COVID-19.\n\n【13】This is a rare case of COVID-19 with Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. COVID-19 can induce many complications in accordance with therapy and social changes during the pandemic. Therefore, changes in TGs should be observed carefully in patients after the resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was not supported by any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Masafumi Shimoda and Yoshiaki Tanaka.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:08", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:22", "cost": 14.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:08"}

Olaparib, an oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic PC with a germline _BRCA_ mutation. In this report, we present the case of a metastatic PC harboring a germline _BRCA2_ mutation, and the daughter of the patient, who had bilateral breast cancers harboring the same germline mutation, suggesting that the PC was associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Although PC is an aggressive disease and has poor prognosis, olaparib was administered as maintenance therapy following modified FOLFIRINOX, providing clinical benefits for >12 months.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is fatal for more than 90% of patients, with approximately 70% succumbing to extensive metastatic disease and the remaining 30% dying from locally destructive PC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Smoking, obesity and diabetes are all risk factors for PC, and genetic factors account for 5–10% of PC cases. The majority of familial PCs are caused by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, which is caused by germline mutations in the _BRCA1/2_ , with _BRCA2_ mutations being the most common genetic alteration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】First-line systemic chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is administered based on performance status, the presence of germline or somatic mutations in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency-associated gene, comorbidity, serum bilirubin level and histological grade. If an HRR deficiency-associated gene mutation is present, FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin plus short-term infusion of fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin and irinotecan) or dose-modified FOLFIRINOX is administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor should be recommended for maintenance therapy rather than continued chemotherapy for patients with a germline _BRCA_ pathogenic variant who have no disease progression after at least 16 weeks of initial platinum-based chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ genes play a crucial role in directing high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In tumors with HR deficiency, such as those harboring _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ gene mutations, compensatory mechanisms fail to repair DNA damage, eventually accumulating damaged and unrepaired DNA and leading to cell death, a phenomenon known as synthetic lethality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Inhibition of PARP has demonstrated marked efficacy against not only breast cancer but also PC with HR deficiency due to defects in BRCA1, BRCA2 or other pathway components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Following the approval of olaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, in Japan on 28 December 2020, physicians have been able to prescribe olaparib to patients with metastatic PC harboring a germline BRCA pathogenic variant. In this report, we present a case of metastatic PC harboring a germline BRCA2 mutation associated with HBOC syndrome and exhibiting a favorable response to olaparib maintenance therapy.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 70-year-old man presented with lower back pain and weight loss. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography revealed an enhancing 37 mm mass in the pancreatic body with a suspicious invasion of the portal vein and tumor embolism in the splenic vein, but no distant metastases or notable lymph node enlargement. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed Class V PC. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were elevated to 27.5 ng/ml (normal range up to 5 ng/ml) and 1917 U/ml (normal range up to 37 U/ml), respectively. In November 2020, he was diagnosed with PC Stage IIA (T3N0M0) . His brother had gastric and prostatic cancers, and his sister had bilateral breast cancer. Five months before the diagnosis, his 38-year-old daughter was diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer and underwent bilateral mastectomy and BRACAnalysis (Myriad Genetics), which revealed a _BRCA2_ variant (c.7666\\_7667dupAA) . When he was diagnosed with PC, the gastroenterologist was unaware of his daughter’s _BRCA2_ variant. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the gastroenterologist received information about the genetic variant from his daughter’s doctor. The effect of neoadjuvant therapy indicated a partial tumor response, with CEA and CA19-9 levels rapidly declining prior to surgery . However, surgical resection was not completed because peritoneal dissemination was detected (i.e. Stage IV \\[T3N0M1\\]) immediately after the surgery started. Modified FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin \\[68 mg per square meter of body surface area\\], irinotecan \\[90 mg per square meter\\], leucovorin \\[200 mg per square meter\\] and fluorouracil \\[1500 mg per square meter\\] every 2 weeks) was then administered, and a BRACAnalysis revealed a _BRCA2_ variant (c.7666\\_7667dupAA). Three cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX were administered because of adverse events, such as anorexia, which did not allow the continuation of treatment till 16 weeks, the negligible effect of further dose reduction on the disease, and the fact that the patient strongly requested changing FOLFIRINOX administration. This led to the stabilization of the disease. Olaparib was then initiated as maintenance therapy, resulting in a continuous partial response over a 12 month treatment period, and CEA and CA19-9 levels gradually decreased over the next couple of months and remained within normal ranges . Two months after treatment, Grade 3 anemia was detected, and the olaparib dose was reduced to 300 mg based on the severity of the anemia . Grade 1 stomatitis was also detected. When the side effects alleviated, the dose was increased to 500 mg until they worsened again .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) A CT image presenting the pancreatic body tumor infiltrating the portal vein in the left panel.

The _BRCA_ genes encode proteins involved in the HR repair of double-strand DNA breaks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. _BRCA_ pathogenic variants are sensitive to PARP inhibition via multiple mechanisms, including PARP trapping on DNA at sites of single-strand breaks, which cannot be repaired accurately in tumors with HR repair defects, resulting in synthetic lethality. Therefore, PARP inhibitors cause an accumulation of DNA damage in tumor cells with a deficiency in DNA damage repair, resulting in tumor cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The PARP inhibitor olaparib has been shown to be clinically effective in patients with ovarian or breast cancer harboring a germline _BRCA_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Additionally, in a Phase III POLO trial, patients with metastatic PC who had a germline _BRCA_ mutation had not had progressive disease during platinum-based chemotherapy—of whom, more than 80% were receiving the FOLFIRINOX regimen—benefited from maintenance therapy with olaparib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of _BRCA2_ mutations identified in PC were frameshifting indels and splice-site mutations, whereas single point mutations are uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the present case, the pathogenic mutation c.7666\\_7667dupAA is located in coding exon 15 of the _BRCA2_ gene, causing a translational frameshift with a predicted alternate stop codon (p.N2556Kfs\\*93). This mutation was identified in a Japanese PC cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition to the clinical data presented in the literature, this alteration is expected to result in loss of function via premature protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n\n【15】Olaparib provided the patient with >12 months of partial response, while the median progression-free survival reached 7.4 months, with fatigue, nausea and anemia being the major adverse events, and the reported frequency of Grade 3 or higher anemia was 11% in the POLO trial. The patient reported herein had Grade 3 anemia, which was alleviated by lowering the olaparib dose. Olaparib is available in a tablet form, and no significant differences in the quality of life of patients have been reported between the olaparib group and placebo group in the POLO trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. FOLFIRINOX, a standard of care for metastatic PC, is a cytotoxic chemotherapy that is administered in the form of an infusion. Furthermore, the safety profile of FOLFIRINOX is less favorable than that of gemcitabine even though FOLFIRINOX significantly reduces quality of life impairment in patients with metastatic PC compared with gemcitabine. It has been reported that approximately 30% of patients had disease progression during their first 4 months of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The patient reported in the present study received a dose-reduced modified FOLFIRINOX from the initial cycle because of the risk of severe adverse events. Therefore, if the patient continued the modified FOLFIRINOX, achieving 12 months of disease control would not have been possible. Moreover, the patient did not meet the criteria for olaparib therapy as he had received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for only 8 weeks. However, it was an appropriate therapy in terms of the palliative treatment because the important goals in metastatic cancer therapy are a longer survival time, improvement of quality of life, and management of symptoms. Olaparib provided the patient with clinical benefits for >12 months and a better quality of life.\n\n【16】In the present report, the patient opted for a BRACAnalysis because a breast surgeon and a gastroenterologist were able to share information about his daughter‘s _BRCA2_ mutation on conversation, despite his remarkable family history of cancer. Therefore, along with clinician communication, it is critical that clinicians share genomic information on medical records or other systems that protect patients’ privacy and keep family histories up-to-date. Screening and early detection of cancer in this family with hereditary _BRCA2_ mutation can save other members in the future. Because the use of BRCA testing for cancer screening and tailoring cancer treatment has increased in the mainstream oncology practice, it may be important to build a genetic information management system and method so that clinicians should standardize BRCA testing practices.\n\n【17】In conclusion, as a maintenance therapy, olaparib was associated with a good response in patients with HBOC syndrome and a germline _BRCA2_ \\-mutated metastatic PC. Sharing genetic results of patients between clinicians is crucial for proper treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no funding sources to report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required for this study in accordance with local or national guidelines.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written informed consent for publication of this case, including images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ryoichi Matsunuma.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:57:50", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:02", "cost": 11.958}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:57:50"}

In general, _N. cyriacigeorgica_ causes infections in immunocompromised individuals and has been reported in clinical samples worldwide. However, the isolation and speciation of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory are complicated and time consuming. Recent mass spectrometry techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) have been successfully integrated into many routine diagnostic microbiology laboratories, allowing for the rapid, accurate and simple identification and speciation of many different microorganisms, including difficult-to-identify bacterial species. Here, we present a case report of a 65-year-old female patient from the neurology ward of Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who was infected with _N. cyriacigeorgica_ . The bacterium was successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, with species identification subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In humans, _Nocardia_ spp. predominantly causes pulmonary nocardiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, _Nocardia_ species are also capable of disseminating from the primary site of infection, such as the lungs, to other organs, including the central nervous system. As such, _Nocardia_ are capable of generating disease at different body sites, including abscesses in the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although _Nocardia_ infections are primarily seen in patients with immunodeficiency, AIDS, cancer and diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, cases have been reported in individuals with fully functioning immune systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among the _Nocardia_ species, _Nocardia cyriacigeorgica_ ( _N. cyriacigeorgica_ ) is an emerging pathogen that appears to be adapting from environmental to human host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The bacterium is primarily found in soil, but can also live in stagnant water and enter the human body through dust respiration and traumatic inoculation. Unfortunately however, the microbiological isolation and identification of _Nocardia_ species from clinical samples within typical hospital laboratories is difficult and time consuming when using conventional diagnostic methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. One potential candidate method that allows for rapid and accurate identification of bacterial species is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). In this case report, we describe the use of MALDI-TOF for identifying the bacterial species _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , isolated from a brain abscess. Species confirmation was obtained via subsequent 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 65-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department of Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, complaining of headache, vomiting, dysarthria and right-sided weakness. She had end-stage renal disease, relied on hemodialysis, and suffered from ischemic heart disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenia and hypothyroidism. The patient subsequently underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which showed a left-sided parietal lesion measuring 5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5 cm, with a midline shift . The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital, and surgery was performed to aspirate material from the brain abscess. Gram staining and acid fast staining of the brain abscess aspirate did not show any bacteria, however, several white blood cells were observed. The aspirate was grown on enrichment medium (RCM) and also on solid media (nutrient agar) and after 72 hours, bacterial growth was found on both media. Conventional methods using biochemical testing and Gram-staining failed to identify the bacterium present within the bacterial colonies, therefore samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF (Bruker MALDI Biotyper System) analysis. MALDI-TOF identified the abscess bacterium as _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , with a score value of 2.11, indicating a ‘High Confidence Identification’ of the bacterial species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Species identification was subsequently confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial isolate by an external reference laboratory (Mayo Clinic, AZ, USA) _._ Antibiotic susceptibility testing—using disc diffusion and E-testing according to CLSI guidelines—showed that the isolated _N. cyriacigeorgica_ species was resistant to penicillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin (intermediate), but susceptible to cotrimoxazole, imipenem, fucidin and ceftriaxone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The patient received empirical antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, a follow-up MRI showed the remaining presence of the lesion, which was excised by craniotomy. An MRI taken following surgery showed no abscess. Postoperatively the patient was found to be well and discharged.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|MRI showing a left parietal lesion measuring 5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5 cm, with a midline shift.</u>\n\n【8】### DISCUSSION\n\n【9】_Nocardia_ species are Gram-positive, aerobic, branching and filamentous bacteria belonging to the actinomycetes group of bacteria, which are ubiquitously found in soil and water. However, infections due to _Nocardia_ are difficult and cumbersome to diagnose because they lack specific clinical signs and do not exhibit pathognomonic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In addition, the bacteria do not grow efficiently in culture media, leading to slow or sometimes no growth, which may specifically be because of the presence of other commensals. Because of these issues, the identification of _Nocardia_ at the species level in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory is very time consuming, and accurate species identification is often not possible using conventional techniques. Currently, the species identification of _Nocardia_ is based on gene sequencing, specifically sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, which has become the ‘gold standard’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The use of genetic-based species identification methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing plays a vital role in _Nocardia_ species determination. Accordingly, these techniques aid epidemiological investigations and provide a better understanding of the management and treatment of nocardiosis infections because different _Nocardia_ species may exhibit different antimicrobial susceptibility patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, genetic-based methods of identification are time consuming and not always available in smaller diagnostic microbiology laboratories; thus, accurate and rapid identification techniques such as MALDI-TOF are showing their value in the current diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory. For example, in this case report, initial pathogen identification was achieved using MALDI-TOF, which has the potential to rapidly and accurately identify _Nocardia_ species in clinical samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, given the rarity of nocardial brain abscesses, the confirmation of the genus/species identification using methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing is still recommended.\n\n【10】The prolonged use of corticosteroids, organ transplantation, the presence of cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection are considered to be the most common predisposing factors for nocardial infections (nocardiosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When nocardial infection occurs, species such as _N_ . _farcinica_ , _N_ . _paucivorans_ , _N. asteroids_ , _N. arthritidis_ and _N. cerradoensis_ have been reported. Among the _Nocardia_ group, _N. cyriacigeorgica_ is one of the most often implicated species in human nocardiosis, including septicemia, endophthalmitis, after liver transplantation, as secondary infections in patients with cancer, in pulmonary infections, cellulitis, spinal abscess, empyema and brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In conclusion, brain abscesses associated with _Nocardia_ species are rare and this is the first case report of the identification of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ isolated from a cerebral abscess in Saudi Arabia. The success of MALDI-TOF in the identification and speciation of difficult to identify bacterial isolates such as _N. cyriacigeorgica_ will help clinicians make effective clinical decisions, particularly in the treatment of life-threatening critical infections such as brain abscesses.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required as patient deceased.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mohammad AlMogbel.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.

Even though it is traditionally linked with hormonal influence, it can also develop in extrauterine organs with a slight female predominance. It is indistinguishable with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) histologically. We report a case of a 30-year-old gentleman who presented with a huge painful mass in the right iliac fossa. Computed tomography revealed a 10 × 10 cm homogeneous mass arising from the terminal ileum; he subsequently underwent an open right hemicolectomy. Histology showed a well-circumscribed lesion composed of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle fibres of the submucosa with positive smooth muscle actin and H-Caldesmon stains but negative for DOG-1 and CD117 (c-kit) stains which were consistent with leiomyoma. Despite its rarity, this hormone-related tumour needs to be considered regardless of gender. Immunohistochemistry is paramount as it is histologically identical to GIST.\n\n【2】case report , hemicolectomy , ileum , leiomyoma\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Leiomyoma is a benign tumour that can arise in any soft tissue sites most commonly in the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The extrauterine cause is rare with gastrointestinal leiomyoma most often found in the oesophagus, stomach and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Leiomyoma of the duodenum is the rarest among all gastrointestinal leiomyomas which is then followed by the ileum. This tumour is classified as mesenchymal neoplasms of gastrointestinal tract which are divided into two groups: gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) and other smooth muscle tumours. The latter group consists of a spectrum of diseases such as lipomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumors, schwannomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There has been a shift in nomenclature to separate GISTs from the smooth muscle tumours due to the discovery of expression of an KIT protein in GISTs by immunohistochemistry in the late 1990s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Smooth muscle tumours are most commonly encountered in middle-aged patients and have a slight female predominance (ratio 1.3:1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a 30-year-old male who presented with a painful right iliac fossa mass, diagnosed as an intestinal leiomyoma following surgical resection.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 30-year-old gentleman with a history of laparoscopic appendicectomy 7 years ago presented to a surgical clinic with a painful right iliac fossa mass for 3 weeks. He was otherwise well and denied any bowel or constitutional symptoms. On examination, there was a 10 × 10 cm tender, firm, mobile, globular mass in the right iliac fossa with no overlying skin changes. No lymph node enlargement was appreciated.\n\n【7】Blood investigations were unremarkable. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a homogeneous oval-shaped soft tissue mass (HU 50-80) arising from the terminal ileum . The mass was 9.8 × 9.0 × 10.4 cm in size with specks of fat within and without calcification. It extended anteriorly and abutted the posterior margin of the right rectus abdominis muscle. The radiological features were suggestive of ileal GIST.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) Axial CT image shows homogenous mass ( <sup>* </sup> ) extending anteriorly abuting the posterior margin of the right rectus abdominis muscle.

However, random biopsies of the terminal ileal wall were obtained and the histopathological report was normal. Terminal ileal GIST was suspected and the patient was prepared for limited right hemicolectomy via a laparoscopic approach. Conversion to open surgery was done due to dense adhesions between the tumour and the anterior and lateral abdominal wall. Intra-operatively, a solid tumour of approximately 8 × 8 cm in size arising from the terminal ileum was resected together as a limited right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis . Post-operatively, he developed an anastomotic leak 5 days after his surgery and subsequently underwent a re-exploration surgery with the formation of a double-barrel stoma. He was discharged and was well at 1 month follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Hemicolectomy specimen with 8 × 8 cm tumour at the terminal ileum.

There was no increment in mitotic activity or cytological atypia. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was negative for CK AE1, CK AE3, DOG-1 and CD117. It was positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and H-Caldesmon .

Clinical presentation depends on size and site of the lesion. Around 44–50% of leiomyomas are symptomatic and can present as intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage or intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Smaller lesions are usually found incidentally during surgery, radiological studies or endoscopy. The clinical presentation is similar to GISTs. Although 50% of these tumours are usually less than 5 cm, around 5% can grow to more than 15 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Diagnostic workup includes an endoscopic assessment of the gastrointestinal tract. However, as 63% of these tumours are extra-luminal and difficult to assess using conventional endoscopy, it may yield negative results as demonstrated in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. CT has been successful in detecting 89.5% of leiomyomas, and the tumours are usually homogeneous, low-attenuation masses with an endoluminal growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging enteroclysis and enterography are gaining acceptance as the initial imaging modality to investigate small-bowel diseases as the soft-tissue contrast is superior and the morphological information and functional information can also be obtained. It is difficult to differentiate GISTs and leiomyoma radiologically as their characteristics overlap as well as the anatomical origin. Other differential diagnoses include leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrohistiocytoma and schwannomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment should be guided by the pathological diagnosis; however, this is difficult to be obtained pre-operatively in practice. If the tumour histology is unknown, an intraoperative pathological diagnosis is recommended via frozen section 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, any suspicious colonic or terminal ileal pathology warrants a surgical resection following oncological outcomes.\n\n【17】Grossly, both leiomyoma and GISTs are typically well circumscribed tumours. Microscopically, both exhibit spindle cell morphology although a minority of GISTs have epithelioid morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although in our case there were no cytological atypia and no increase in mitosis, smooth muscle tumours of the small bowel larger than 10 cm have been found to have 33% risk of progressive disease warranting a follow-up of at least 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is clinically important to differentiate leiomyoma from GISTs as the latter is 40–50% malignant and these patients may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors. KIT (CD117) and GIST-1 (DOG-1) are established GISTs markers with 95% sensitivity. The discovery of KIT as the main proto-oncogene in GISTs necessitated the use of KIT inhibitors such as imatinib in the setting of metastatic or unresectable GISTs, or adjuvant therapy for high-risk disease, thus significantly improving recurrent free survival and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, the immunohistochemical tests were negative for both and were positive for the smooth muscle markers (actin and H-Caldesmon), which strongly suggest a leiomyoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Terminal ileum leiomyoma is a rare cause of acute abdomen. CT is a helpful tool to diagnose this entity. However, histopathological examination with adjunct immunohistochemistry is of paramount importance to distinguish between GIST or leiomyoma and benign or potential malignant diseases to guide further treatment.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the Director-General of Health Malaysia for his permission to publish this article as a case report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required for this report.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

Corneal status was monitored with SS-ASOCT . At 9 weeks after initial presentation the perforation healed with no leakage and a small residual epithelial deficit . This was confirmed with SS-ASCOT .\n\n【17】The patient presented again 2 years after the original perforation with very similar symptoms in her fellow eye. Examination revealed an inferior rupture of Descemet’s membrane and a perforation at the 7 to 8 o’clock position with a brisk leak. ASOCT confirmed the perforation, and this was managed in the first instance with corneal gluing and anterior chamber reformation in theaters. This failed; so the patient subsequently had primary suturing of the perforation. At 12 weeks postoperatively her corneal sutures were removed uneventfully. Her visual acuity improved to 0.3LogMAR on pin hole in both eyes with a mild cataract.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】The underlying causes of corneal perforations are varied but can be broadly characterized into infectious and noninfectious causes. The noninfectious causes are related to four major pathologies: (i) severe ocular surface disease, (ii) autoimmune disease, (iii) trauma and (iv) corneal ectasias.\n\n【20】The clinical and topographical evidence of peripheral corneal thinning suggest that this is the most likely underlying mechanism of perforation in this case. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first reported case of spontaneous corneal perforation secondary to PMD that has been visualized using SS-ASCOT. It provided high-resolution imaging to assess the extent of perforation, degree of wound healing and eventual resolution.\n\n【21】The use of SS-OCT is widespread in the medical retina community due to its improved resolution (1 μm) and ability to image the choroid compared to spectral-domain OCT. The Triton SS-ASOCT 16-mm radius protocol provides a quick scan of the entire cornea, whereas the 6-mm scan provides a more detailed image of a selected area. This is useful for evaluating structural alterations that may not be detectable with larger scans. A number of studies have evaluated ASOCT features of acute hydrops with common findings of epithelial and stromal edema, intrastromal fluid and Descemet’s membrane detachment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Recently SS-ASOCT was used to evaluate corneas with LASIK flap-related complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and as adjunctive tool in evaluating the adherence of grafts post DMEK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It has also been shown to be an effective screening tool for the detection of early subclinical keratoconus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Nine-week anterior segment follow-up pictures showing that the perforation healed ( **A** ) with no leakage and no residual epithelial deficit ( **B** ). This was confirmed with SS-ASCOT showing the formation of stromal scar in the area previously perforated and localized thinning ( **C** ).</u>\n\n【23】While there is a general consensus for the management of larger perforations (>3 mm), the management of smaller perforations is not well defined. However, there are some important underlying principles. All patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye and an eye shield should be applied. Fluoroquinolones have been shown to have high transcorneal penetration, low rates of resistance and reduced hospital stays 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Cycloplegic agents can also be used in conjunction because they provide comfort and minimize adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The use of steroids is controversial. It has the potential to exacerbate infection but could minimize damage from the inflammatory response. Cohen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> support the notion that steroids should be started after the antibiotic has had time to take effect and the sensitivities are known. The use of a bandage contacts lenses has been shown to promote epithelial healing and minimize discomfort. Cyanoacrylate glue has been shown to improve visual outcomes and prevent progression to perforation in thinned noninfective corneas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bob Tapper.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Andrew Coombes.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:47:01", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:47:33", "cost": 32.261}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:47:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:47:01"}

The patient initially was treated for empyema with antibiotics but later represented to hospital with worsening symptoms. He underwent a surgical Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure and lung biopsy, which revealed a diagnosis of mesothelioma. The young age of the patient as well as absence of significant risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis unexpected. The patient had total body irradiation (TBI) therapy for leukaemia as a child, which increases the risk of developing cancer. However, there are limited studies exploring the risk of pleural mesothelioma post-TBI. Young patients who represent to hospital, with limited response to initial treatment, and suspicious radiological features should be considered for lung biopsy to reduce the risk of a missed diagnosis. Patients with a background of TBI should also be considered for follow-up to monitor for any subsequent malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Mesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the mesothelium, most commonly presenting in the pleura. In the UK, it accounted for 1% of all deaths between 2016 and 2018. Mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos fibre exposure, and patients often have a background of occupational exposure. Other non-asbestos mineral fibres and therapeutic radiation are less common risk factors for developing mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Almost 20% of patients diagnosed with mesothelioma have no prior history of asbestos exposure. There are other identified causes of mesothelioma including: erionite mineral fibre, carbon nanotubes, irradiation treatment, thorium dioxide, viruses including the avian leukosis virus and also chronic serosal inflammation, such as that seen in familial mediterranean fever and chronic empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The presentation of symptoms can be as long as 40 years from asbestos exposure and deaths in the UK from mesothelioma commonly occurred between the ages of 85 and 89 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】This case report discusses an atypical presentation of pleural mesothelioma in a young patient in his 30s with no significant risk factors and absence of asbestos tissue in the body. The report considers total body irradiation (TBI) therapy contributing towards the diagnosis of mesothelioma and the clinical manifestations in this young patient.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 34-year-old male patient presented to hospital with a short history of persistent cough, shortness of breath and fever. The patient has a background of leukaemia as a child for which treatment included TBI. He also had thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a history of mental health issues. There is no family history of note. The patient reported having symptoms for three weeks prior to admission but no history of chest pain. On examination, he was noted to have reduced air entry on the left and was not clubbed. He was a non-smoker and there was no history of asbestos exposure. Blood results did not show raised inflammatory markers. The patient had a CT scan of the thorax which revealed marked pleural thickening with a left sided effusion . The patient refused pleural aspiration during this admission. The working diagnosis was empyema for which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient refused surgical intervention during this admission and his background of anxiety may have contributed to this decision. He was discharged with a prolonged course of oral antibiotics, with a view to early follow up.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CT scan of the thorax that shows left sided pleural thickening. CT scan of the thorax.</u>\n\n【8】Two months after his initial presentation to hospital, he was re-admitted due to worsening shortening of breath and chest pain. A repeat CT scan showed significant progression of his left sided pleural thickening with a new right sided effusion. Blood results again did not demonstrate a significant rise in infection markers. Microbiological and cytological analysis of pleural fluid did not reveal an obvious diagnosis .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【12】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【16】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\n【17】With further counselling, he underwent a left Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure with pleural biopsy. The appearances were noted to be atypical for empyema as well as malignancy. There were post-inflammatory changes seen with a significantly thickened pleura, but no frank pus visible. Biopsies were taken from left lung parietal pleura, which confirmed an unexpected diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma T4 N1 M0 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|H&E x100—Parietal pleural tissue extensively infiltrated by epithelioid tumour cells forming cords, nests and tubular structures.

Sadly, the patient passed away 17 months after his initial presentation at the age of 35.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】The young age of the patient along with the absence of significant asbestos-related risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis of mesothelioma unexpected. Other factors should be explored which may have contributed to the development of mesothelioma.\n\n【23】The incidence of mesothelioma in those aged under 35 years old in the UK was 4 per 100 000, with the trend of incidence significantly increasing with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The young presentation of the patient without any known asbestos exposure would have suggested a low clinical suspicion of mesothelioma.\n\n【24】The patient underwent TBI therapy for the treatment of leukaemia during his childhood. The risk of developing cancer is increased after TBI. The latency of mesothelioma development after TBI was 29 years in our patient. The level of radiation along with age at which treatment was received can influence the clinical risk. A study looking at patients over a 45-year period found that higher dose radiation as well as treatment under the age of 20 significantly increased the risk of developing cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A further study also demonstrates that pulmonary toxicity increases after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】There is a difference in risk of secondary carcinogenesis between local radiation therapy and total body irradiation. A study looking at leukaemia in patients with cervical cancer who received local radiotherapy found that the risk of leukaemia increased two folds (RR = 2.0; 90% confidence interval = 1.0-4.2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The risk of malignant neoplasms increased by 2.8-fold after TBI (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval = 2.6-3.1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The study suggested lifelong monitoring for early detection of secondary carcinogenesis following TBI. There have been reported cases of peritoneal mesothelioma after TBI, however studies looking at reported cases of pleural mesothelioma are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The British childhood cancer survivor study that looked at outcomes of children diagnosed with cancer who may have received cancer treatment did not report any cases of pleural mesothelioma after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A systematic literature search has not shown any similar prior cases and, to the best of our knowledge, our case is the first of its kind.\n\n【26】The young age of onset of mesothelioma in this patient is an uncommon finding and the diagnosis could be missed or delayed in the clinical setting. In young patients diagnosed with clinical features of extensive pleural thickening, with a low suspicion of an infective aetiology, radiological investigation and subsequent biopsy should be considered early. Lifelong monitoring post-TBI therapy is also important for the early detection of secondary carcinogenesis. Although the risk of cancer is increased in patients with a background of TBI, further research into the risk of developing pleural malignant mesothelioma after TBI would be useful to guide clinical management.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n---------------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Doris Rassl for her assistance in interpreting the pathology samples.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

A year earlier, she was diagnosed with stage IIB (cT1bN1M0) lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion, which was treated with surgery. During the surgery, unexpected tumor metastases on the pleura and left diaphragm were detected , and the surgery was suspended. Soon after, afatinib was administrated as first-line therapy. After 6 months, a complete response of the tumor was achieved.\n\n【9】The patient visited the emergency department with nausea. There was no abnormality on physical examination or abdominal radiography. Infectious colitis or an adverse drug reaction related to the EGFR-TKI was suspected; she underwent intravenous rehydration therapy, which improved her symptoms, and she walked back home. The next day, she presented again with nausea and was admitted to the hospital. Her vital signs were in the normal range. There were no abnormal findings on physical examination and no abdominal pain. Other than a slightly increased white blood cell count (9800/μl), laboratory examinations were normal. Two days after admission, her nausea worsened and we performed chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). The left diaphragm was elevated according to the chest X-ray , and chest CT revealed a DH . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an abnormal color change in a gastric mucosal lesion . We suspected a strangulated hernia with gastric incarceration and performed urgent laparoscopic surgery. Although the gastric mucosa had turned dark red , the color recovered soon after repair of the hernia, and no organ resection was necessary. We observed a defect in the diaphragm  where we had previously detected diaphragmatic metastasis. The hole was sutured, and 1 month after the surgery, we confirmed that her gastric mucosal color had improved .\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Pleural spread in NSCLC is reported in 8–15% patients on baseline imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

In our case, we could not detect pleural dissemination before surgery. Figure 3A shows pleural dissemination detected during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We found a defect at the same site during treatment of the DH by laparoscopy . We suspect that tumor regression caused by the EGFR-TKI resulted in diaphragmatic perforation, and the pressure difference between the thoracic and abdominal cavities resulted in the DH. The intrathoracic pressure is reported to be ~100 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O lower than the intra-abdominal pressure during maximal inspiratory effort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In addition, vomiting increases intra-abdominal pressure, which may also have played a role in the development of the DH.\n\n【12】DH is caused by congenital or acquired defects in the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Acquired DH is rare and can go unnoticed during the immediate phase without obvious symptoms; this diagnostic delay leads to an overall mortality rate of up to 31% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Since DH does not recover spontaneously, incarcerated organs lead to necrosis and perforation. Therefore, urgent surgery is necessary once a diagnosis of DH is made.\n\n【13】In conclusion, although EGFR-TKIs often cause gastrointestinal symptoms, we should consider the rare possibility of DH in lung cancer patients with potential metastasis to the diaphragm.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors participated in the preparation and writing of the manuscript.

Here, a patient receiving anti-PD-1 antibodies exhibited cranial dura matter involvement, and dura enhancement on MRI was resolved by treatment withdrawal with anti-PD-1 antibodies only.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】This is a case of a 69-year-old man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with seven courses of pembrolizumab (200 mg) combined with pemetrexed (820 mg/kg) and carboplatin (6.6 mg/kg) administered every month. An enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed every year for the early detection of metastatic brain tumors. After seven courses of these chemotherapies and pembrolizumab, the brain MRI revealed thickness and enhancement of the dura matter  without the abnormal intensity of the brain parenchyma. An asymptomatic internal carotid posterior communicating (IC-PC) artery aneurysm was evident, leading to a visit to our department. No history of neurological manifestations, including headache, and no neurological deficit were reported. He had no meningismus. Serum laboratory examinations were within the normal range. Serum autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-DNA antibody, and anti-cardiolipin antibody, were negative. Additionally, the levels of serum IgG, IgM or IgG-4 were not increased. The levels of serum aspergillus antigen, β-D glucan and angiotensin-converting enzyme were within the normal range. Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings revealed no white blood cells, protein (37 mg/dl) and glucose (64 mg/dl) with no increase in titers of herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus, cryptococcus antigen or adenosine deaminase. The IgG index was 0.45. The bacterial and tuberculosis culture and cytology results of the CSF were negative. Four months after discontinuing pembrolizumab, a repeat MRI revealed that the enhancement of dura matter was resolved . Five months after the first MRI, IC-PC aneurysm was operated on and simultaneously a dural biopsy was performed. Histological findings revealed no malignant or inflammatory cells. The clinical course was free of neurological complaints or features. Additional cancer treatment was not performed because tumor shrinkage was maintained with no further development on a repeat follow-up whole-body computed tomography. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for these routine clinical examinations, treatments and publication of the case report.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Upper panel: Brain enhanced MRI showed enhancements of the dura matter after seven cycles of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

Previously, one patient with meningoencephalitis revealed diffuse dural enhancement on MRI, and the patient recovered completely after steroid treatment; however, the detailed clinical information, including imaging, was not mentioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The exact mechanism underpinning neurological adverse events has been largely unknown. It has been postulated that ICPI disrupts immune tolerance resulting in an exaggerated immune response manifesting neurological adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Cross-reactivity between the nervous system antigens and antigens expressing the tumor is a hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. PD-L2 is expressed in brain endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, but whether the ligand exists in the dura matter is uncertain. A mouse model expressing a neo-self-antigen in both Purkinje neurons and implanted breast tumor cells evoked antigen-specific T-cell migration into the cerebellum after treatment with an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Most patients presenting with neurological adverse effects had no involvement of other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, supporting the cross-reactivity of specific nervous system antigens with tumor antigens.\n\n【9】This case was asymptomatic, and complications due to ICPIs resolved with ICPI discontinuation were incidentally found. The patient did not need additional immunosuppressant treatment. The diagnosis of encephalitis associated with ICPIs can be challenging because MRI is not highly sensitive, with an estimated sensitivity of 55% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These patients have advanced malignancies with limited treatment options. It is important to note that treatment discontinuation risks and benefits need to be carefully discussed, and decisions for treatment need to be made on a case-to-case basis, depending on the severity of neurological symptoms.\n\n【10】ICPI discontinuation only has a potential during recovery from a mild CNS disorder. Hence, as a recommendation, additional immunosuppressant treatment with efficiency for reducing the severity of neurological complications due to ICPIs should be considered when severe clinical deficits are evident or worsen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thanks to Dr Shigeto Kizu, Department of Respiratory Medicine for his management of lung adenocarcinoma.

Single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy prior to 22 weeks of gestation has been reported to be strongly correlated with double twin demise. To our knowledge, there are no case reports on the natural course of a surviving co-twin in an MM twin pregnancy resulting in live birth after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation. Here, we report a case of a surviving co-twin, after a single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation in a MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage leading to porencephaly, and live birth at 36 weeks of gestation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Monochorionic monoamniotic (MM) twin pregnancy is the least common type of twin pregnancy and carries a high risk of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).

Previous studies have suggested that almost all single IUFDs that occur prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy have been reported to result in double twin demise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 4 \\]</u>. Here, we report on an extremely rare case of a surviving co-twin after single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation due to cord entanglement in an MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage, resulting in porencephaly and live birth.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 33-year-old female, gravida 2, para 2, was referred to our hospital for the management of an MM twin pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. At 20 weeks of gestation, the entanglement of the umbilical cords was observed on ultrasound. At 21 weeks of gestation, IUFD of one fetus was confirmed and the surviving fetus displayed mild hydrops fetalis with the findings of subcutaneous edema and pleural effusion. Increased middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was observed (42 cm/s: >1.5 MoM), suggesting that acute anemic status caused by blood transfusion from the surviving fetus to the demised fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Serial counseling was provided for the mother and her family regarding the expected poor prognosis of the surviving co-twin and the possibility of severe neurological impairment and double IUFD; however, the mother chose to continue with the pregnancy.\n\n【6】At 23 weeks of gestation, the hydropic changes of the surviving fetus disappeared. However, atrophy of cerebral parenchyma with an enlarged posterior horn of the lateral ventricle was observed. At 26 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus revealed severe ventriculomegaly, atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum . Additionally, at 26 weeks of gestation, oligohydramnios with amniotic fluid index (AFI; normal range: 5–25 cm) of 1.8 cm acutely emerged.

In our case, the surviving fetus displayed not only neurological damage resulting in porencephaly, but also bilateral renal hypoplasia, which were speculated to be caused by acute detrimental circulatory changes on the brain and kidneys after single IUFD. To our knowledge, there have been no case reports that describe the antenatal course of a surviving co-twin after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【15】Genova _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported that severe kidney failure was recognized in only 1 of 44 cases (2.3%) of single IUFD in monochorionic twin pregnancies. In our case, the surviving fetus exhibited signs of kidney failure from the severe oligohydramnios and renal hypoplasia seen on ultrasound. It is noteworthy that the volume of the amniotic fluid started to increase continuously from 28 weeks of gestation up to a normal range. One possible explanation for this change is that the fetal renal function might be gradually ameliorated because of the recovery from aberrant circulatory status of acute blood loss and hypovolemia as a result of single IUFD. Additionally, it is speculated that a certain number of nephrons were still preserved even if bilateral kidneys were morphologically impaired, which is supported by the fact that a blood creatinine level spontaneously decreased after birth. Our case provides valuable evidence that severe renal damage during the fetal period could recover, resulting in a live birth. However, it is difficult to predict the long-term prognosis given the short 3-month follow-up. Further close attention to renal function is necessary to assess the risk of chronic kidney disease later in life.\n\n【16】In conclusion, this is a case report on a surviving fetus with an extremely rare clinical course after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy. The important aspect of this case is that a monoamniotic twin not only survived after early demise of its co-twin but also demonstrated recovery of renal function in the neonatal period despite the prenatal diagnosis of bilateral renal hypoplasia. We feel that this case report provides valuable information to enable both obstetricians and patients to make informed choice and furthers the understanding of the fetal pathophysiological changes after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:37", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:49", "cost": 12.285}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:37"}

We describe the case of a 70-year-old female who presented central chest pain, hypotension and electrocardiogram changes on a background of a 6-month prior episode of resolved Takotsubo’s with unknown cause. After progressing to cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure, computerized tomography coronary aortogram revealed an incidental adrenal mass, later proven to be a secretory pheochromocytoma on biochemistry and subsequent histology.

Here, we present the case of an otherwise well, healthy female with two presentations of Takotsubo’s, escalating in severity, before definitive treatment of her adrenal tumour.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old female presented to her local hospital with nausea, central chest pain, palpitations, vomiting and shortness of breath. She was found to be hypotensive, with a moderate troponin rise (150 ng/l) and S–T elevation on electrocardiogram (leads V1–V4). She was transferred to a private regional hospital coronary care unit (CCU) where cardiac investigations including transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and angiogram were found to be normal. She reported no recent increase in stress, and her past medical history was significant for previous hemithyroidectomy (2011, currently euthyroid) and osteoarthritis, with no history of diabetes, hypertension or smoking, and no family history of catecholamine-secreting tumours. Notably, she had presented 6-month earlier to her local hospital with an episode of hypotension, chest pain and TTE findings consisting of an ejection fraction of 30%, hypokinetic left ventricle (LV), poorly contracting right ventricle (RV) with dilatation and mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Consistent with TS, symptoms and TTE findings had resolved within 3 months on repeat TTE with commencement of aspirin 100 mg in the morning, simvastatin 20 mg and rampiril 1.25 mg in the evening.\n\n【6】Twenty-four hours after commencing bisoprolol 12.5 mg BD in CCU, she developed cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management. She was profoundly bradycardic (40 bpm), with a troponin of 7327 ng/l, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ~18–23% with severe regional wall motion abnormalities (severe akinesis in all segments except the base), mildly dilated right ventricle with wall motion abnormality  and evidence of end organ dysfunction (acute kidney injury and ischaemic hepatitis). She reported no pain however was diaphoretic with ongoing nausea. Milrinone and dobutamine infusions were commenced, resulting in tachycardia up to 200 bpm with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate (RVR), which was chemically reverted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, and required no further inotropic support. Computerized tomography (CT) angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease and notably her CT aortogram revealed no aortic dissection but an incidental finding of a 5.8 × 4.8 × 5.5 heterogenous mass right-sided adrenal mass.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Apical 4 chamber view of left ventricular and right ventricular views shows severe segmental systolic dysfunction. Estimated LVEF was 20% by Simpson’s biplane method.</u>\n\n【8】Endocrinology was consulted: biochemistry showed an elevated serum cortisol on dexamethasone suppression test (>1650 nmol/l; normal range < 50 nmol/l), and elevated early morning cortisol (>1649 nmol/l), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 15.7H pmol/l), renin (100 mIU/l) and aldosterone (835 pmol/l). Plasma metanephrines (normetadrenaline 20 000 pmol/l, normal range 130–1600; Metadrenaline 36 000 pmol/l, normal range 30–540) and 3 Methoxy Tyramine (682 pmol/l, normal range < 120) were also significantly elevated, suspicious for a secretory pheochromocytoma. She was commenced on alpha and beta blockade therapy (prazocin 2.5 mg/metoprolol 12.5 mg, once daily) and the upper gastrointestinal surgical team was consulted for elective resection after successful uptitration of her alpha blocker by cardiology/endocrinology teams. She was consented and proceeded for elective resection of her adrenal mass in the following 6 weeks when recovered, with pre-operative review in the high-risk anaesthetics clinic and planned post-operative transfer to ICU. Histology was positive for an organ-confined pheochromocytoma with no vascular/capsular invasion , consistent with T1NX on 8th Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. She recovered well post-operatively under the care of the cardiology/endocrinology teams and was discharged one week later. Repeated echocardiogram at follow-up demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function at 3 months.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Right adrenalectomy specimen, capsule intact, measuring 60 × 25 × 25 mm, weight 84.1 g.

However, robust data on patients with TS secondary to pheochromocytoma is lacking. Larger datasets, such as the International Takotsubo Registry, (consisting of 9 countries and 1750 patients), excludes those with pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although there have been over 80 published case reports of pheochromocytoma-induced TS (PTS; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>), this is likely underreported, with a number erroneously reported as pheochromocytoma-induced angina or myocardial infarction, rather than TS per se 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We highlight three keyways PTS differs from TS—tendency to recurrence, symptom profile and complications. These differences are reflected in this case, and we hope may represent both diagnostic clues and considerations for other clinicians.\n\n【13】Both meta-analysis and case reports support the idea of recurrence. In a recent meta-analysis of 156 cases comparing catecholamine-induced (including pheochromocytoma amongst other secretory tumours and external administration) and non-catecholamine induced TS, Y-Hassan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and Falhammar found the catecholamine-induced TS group exclusively demonstrated recurrence rate (16.8%; 18/107; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>). Preliminary data from the German Italian Spanish Takotsubo (GEIST) registry of 839 patients also found greater recurrence (17.7% vs 3.26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. In cases of recurrence, normalization of left ventricular function is found on repeat echocardiogram (seen in our patient). From the literature, time between presentations is highly variable, ranging from 1 week to 6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10–12 \\]</u>, with a number of presentations between 2 and 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10–12 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system hyper-activation represents core pathophysiology of TS. Although catecholamine surge is associated with pheochromocytomas, the pathophysiology is not completely elucidated and this may be reflected in variability in presentations between PTS and TS. The symptomatology of adrenal tumours in general is broad and non-specific, and may be affected by sex. Regardless of histological subtype, both TS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and adrenal tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> are more common in postmenopausal women, with advancing age and estrogen-deficiency risk factors for vasomotor changes and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, although signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma are variable and non-specific, females have also been suggested to present with significantly more symptoms irrespective of biological phenotype and tumour presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Compared with other causes of TS, PTS are less likely to be associated with chest pain (42.25 vs 75.9%), and present with labile blood pressure in nearly half (47.5%) of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, hypertension did not occur. Despite its well-known association, it is important to keep in mind that hypertension is an unreliable symptom of pheochromocytoma in general—occurring in only 59% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>—adding to diagnostic complexity.\n\n【15】The severity of complications in PTS compared to TS should also keep PTS an important differential. Catecholamine-induced TS are more likely to be associated with younger age, the apical sparing ballooning pattern on echocardiogram, more severe disease with lower LVEF (27.7 vs 41.1%), greater heart rate, greater complications (68.2 vs 21.8%), more cardiogenic shock (37.7 vs 9.9%) and greater use of inotropes (32.7 vs 12.2%; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>). Of published case reports, only three cases presented with cardiogenic shock, with a larger number (34.6%; 27/78) complicated by subsequent cardiogenic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The GEIST registry found right ventricular involvement (as seen in our patient) in TS to be rare (~11%), and significantly associated with cardiogenic shock and all-cause mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Symptom severity and greater complication rates may be attributable to the episodic and extreme nature of catecholamine surges in pheochromocytoma, which would impair coronary vasomotor function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, and over a prolonged period, may influence density of myocardial B1–B2-adrenoreceptors, 1 <sup>2 </sup> leading to further dysfunction.\n\n【16】The atypical nature of PTS may lead to diagnostic delays, as in this case, which is concerning given the increased rate of complications in this subgroup. As Shams et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> note, early diagnosis may avoid further damage caused by excessive use of inotropes, as well as use of beta blockers without adequate, prior alpha blockade. Hence, we suggest secretory adrenal tumours should be considered as a differential diagnosis for Takotsubo’s Syndrome—particularly, a subsequent presentation of sympathetic hyperactivation, and presentations in the post-menopausal female, should give clinicians a low threshold for screening.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:13:48", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:14:39", "cost": 51.124}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:14:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:13:47"}

However, the procedure is not without risks of severe morbidity. We herein report hemostasis for accidental venous puncture using thoracoscopy. A 44-year-old man with short bowel syndrome and chronic renal failure required central venous catheterization for nutritional management and hemodialysis. Right internal jugular vein puncture was performed under ultrasonographic guidance, and the guidewire was inserted into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. However, the operator inadvertently perforated the vein, and the thoracic cavity was entered while inserting the introducer. The patient’s vital signs were stable; therefore, we performed emergency surgery after computed tomography and achieved hemostasis through thoracoscopic surgery. Sufficient caution should be exercised while inserting central venous catheters through a thrombosed internal jugular vein. In some instances of catheter-induced vessel injury, combined surface and thoracoscopic hemostasis may be a reliable and minimally invasive management option.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Central venous (CV) catheterization is commonly required for patient management. However, therapy can be complicated by morbidities caused by this procedure; these complications can be severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>. Here, we describe a case of an accidental puncture into the thoracic cavity upon insertion of an introducer into the right internal jugular vein (IJV) and the management strategy used to mitigate the damage.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for living-donor kidney transplantation. He had a history of short bowel syndrome due to massive small bowel resection by mesenteric lymphangioma at 3 years of age, and a history of chronic renal disease secondary to renal interstitial disorders associated with short bowel syndrome and chronic dehydration, requiring dialysis since 41 years of age. He received living-donor kidney transplantation; however, he developed acute cellular rejection, and dialysis was required again. Owing to the above condition, the patient has required the installation of multiple venous catheters, with the development of calcifications and thrombi in both brachiocephalic veins and subclavian veins. Computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis of the right IJV ; however, ultrasonography revealed normal blood flow. To establish long-term CV access for dialysis, we planned to insert a Soft Cell™ catheter (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Under sonographic guidance, the operator attempted catheter insertion into the right IJV. A guidewire was inserted into the superior vena cava (SVC) under fluoroscopy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Enhanced CT shows the thrombus in the IJV (arrow).

( **C** ) Three-dimensional CT shows the intrathoracic perforation of the introducer (arrowhead).</u>\n\n【7】During the procedure, the operator noted incorrect orientation of the introducer tip, which appeared positioned within the thoracic cavity. The inner cylinder was withdrawn, revealing no blood flow. A small pneumothorax developed due to air ingress via the outer cylinder, which was immediately capped. The operator suspected inadvertent placement of the introducer into the thoracic cavity; therefore, we were consulted to assist with its removal. The patient’s vital signs were stable, and there was no hemothorax; therefore, immediate CT was performed to localize the perforation. No perforation was found in the right clavicular artery and SVC; however, an intrathoracic perforation through the IJV was observed . Therefore). To prevent massive hemorrhage upon removal, we contemplated surface compression and intrathoracic compression in case of a perforation involving only the IJV, and a median sternotomy in case of arterial perforation.\n\n【8】The introducer did not injure the lung, although an intrapleural hematoma was observed around the perforation site . After dissecting the mediastinal pleura, we confirmed a venous perforation without arterial perforation .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Thoracoscopic view of the intrathoracic perforation of the introducer. ( **B** ) The introducer did not injure the subclavian artery (arrow) and perforated only the IJV.</u>\n\n【10】After removing the introducer, a human fibrinogen-thrombin patch and oxidized regenerated cellulose were applied from within the thoracic cavity to achieve pressure hemostasis. We simultaneously achieved pressure hemostasis from the body surface.\n\n【11】After successful hemostasis, the mediastinal pleura was sutured to coaptation (operative time, 98 min; bleeding, 2 g). The postoperative course was uneventful; 3 days later, a dialysis catheter was inserted through the right femoral vein. During follow-up, 1.5 years after the surgery, the patient was alive.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】A CV catheter can be lifesaving; however, its insertion is associated with potentially severe complications, including hemo- and/or pneumothorax, nerve injury, major bleeding, catheter-related bloodstream infection and venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>. Patients requiring CV catheters often have complex pathologies, and the morbidities associated with CV insertion further complicate treatment. Prospective randomized trials and meta-analyses have suggested that the use of ultrasonography when placing IJV catheters reduces complication rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Our operator performed venipuncture using ultrasonography; however, intrathoracic perforation occurred.\n\n【14】In this case, CT showed an IJV thrombus related to a prior CV catheterization; however, ultrasonography confirmed blood flow in the IJV, suggesting that the guidewire could be placed into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. When inserting the introducer, an incorrect insertion angle might have led to contralateral perforation, and thrombus may have contributed. Applying excessive force when the introducer cannot be advanced is dangerous. Care is required during catheter insertion into a thrombosed vessel, and puncture should be avoided. In this case, inserting a temporary femoral venous dialysis catheter may have been considered. In addition, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stent placement has been suggested as the preferred approach to CV stenosis.\n\n【15】If a large venous catheter perforates into the intrathoracic cavity, a massive hemopneumothorax may occur, requiring surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient’s vital signs were stable, and no hemothorax was observed on fluoroscopy. Therefore, we performed a CT scan to examine the perforation in detail. If the catheter is removed immediately after vessel perforation, massive bleeding may result, and the injured vessel may be difficult to identify.\n\n【16】With massive venous bleeding, or subclavian artery perforation, thoracoscopic hemostasis may be dangerous. These injuries are conventionally managed using open surgical exploration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of thoracoscopic surgery for catheter-related subclavian artery or vein injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient’s vital signs were stable after the inadvertent puncture. After thin-slice (0.5 mm) CT examination of the traumatized area, we suspected an IJV puncture without hemothorax. Even if only the IJV is injured, if a large catheter reaches the thoracic cavity, the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity may cause massive hemothorax. In addition, confirming that only the IJV is injured is impossible if enhanced CT is foregone because of the emergency. To date, reports of thoracoscopic hemostasis have identified hemothorax after CV catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In this case, we suspected a misplacement into the thoracic cavity during the insertion of the introducer. In such cases, if the introducer is removed immediately, massive bleeding may occur, and it may be difficult to identify the injured vessel. Therefore, the catheter was removed with thoracoscopic support in anticipation of massive bleeding due to subclavian artery or vein injury.\n\n【17】In conclusion, caution should be exercised while inserting CV catheters through a thrombosed IJV. Even with correct guidewire placement under fluoroscopy, the introducer might be inserted incorrectly. In catheter-related vessel injury, combined external and thoracoscopic hemostasis may be a reliable and minimally invasive option.\n\n【18】AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------\n\n【19】ST: Conceptualization; Data curation; Writing—original draft.

However, generally, most patients with sepsis from rural area initially visit the emergency department at a rural hospital and are managed in general medical wards in Japan. Here we report on an 81-year-old Japanese female manifesting septic shock caused by the upper urinary tract infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing _Escherichia coli_ secondary to the left ureter obstruction by the urothelial carcinoma. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Although critical for the source control of infection, drainage of the ureteropelvic junction could not be performed immediately because of catecholamine-resistant hypotension. Hence, we administered polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion, followed by low-dose hydrocortisone administration. After 8 hours of infusion, she recovered from the septic shock and successfully underwent emergency percutaneous nephrostomy. This presented strategy may provide a new resolution of catecholamine-resistant patients in urosepsis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Urosepsis caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) accounts for 20%–30% of sepsis cases, and uroseptic shock is a disease with high mortality, mainly caused by obstructive uropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is a device that purifies blood by neutralizing circulating endotoxins, thereby inhibiting the progression of the septic cascade mediated by lipopolysaccharide, a core lipid portion of the gram-negative bacterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Studies have demonstrated that PMX-DHP reduces hospital mortality and the length of intensive care unit stay in patients with acute-phase septic shock control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the long term effect of PMX-DHP on survival rate has been insignificant in the ABDOMIX and EUPHRATES studies, despite an improvement in mean arterial pressure elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Glucocorticoids increase the sensitivity of alpha- and beta-adrenaline receptors. An adjunctive low-dose steroid has been reported to significantly shorten the time to recover from septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Various effects of glucocorticoids, including immune-modulating properties through interaction with NF-κB and elevation of blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenesis in the liver and peripheral tissues, are favorable against septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In Furano city, a rural area in the northern part of Japan, there are no facilities such as helicopters to transfer patients to an intensive care unit of an urban hospital after sunset. Such patients need to be treated with available medical resources. In this case report, we present a case of uroseptic shock caused by the obstructive pyelonephritis, that was successfully treated at a rural hospital with a combination of PMX and a low-dose steroid.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 81-year-old Japanese woman with twice histories of UTI presented to our emergency department with fever, anorexia and immobility around 4 pm. Her initial physical findings presented clear consciousness, body temperature of 37.5°C that continued since 3 days ago, upper extremity blood pressure (BP) of 68/36 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm with irregular rhythm, respiratory rate of 24 cycles per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% with 6 L/min of 100% oxygen administration via a Venturi mask. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left costovertebral angle. The urine was white and cloudy in appearance and the leukocyte esterase test was positive. Microscopic examination revealed more than 50/hpf of white blood cells (WBC). Blood test revealed significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers, such as WBC, 27.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/μl with 93.8% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; blood urea nitrogen, 31.2 of mg/dl; creatinine, 2.7 mg/dl; C-reactive protein, 26.7 mg/dl; glucose, 70 mg/dl; lactate, 3.3 m mol/L; and endotoxins, 2000 pg/ml. The arterial blood gas test revealed a pH of 7.39, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 33 mm Hg, and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 80.9 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Noncontrast computed tomography imaging revealed a left ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction by a mass containing low-density fluid, which was diagnosed as an abscess by the radiologist . She was diagnosed with uroseptic shock secondary to the obstructive pyelonephritis with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 3 points.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography image of percutaneous nephrostomy.

Thus, the initial source control by percutaneous nephrostomy was not performed due to the hypotension. To further account for hypotension and sepsis simultaneously, PMX-DHP was initiated and intravenous hydrocortisone of 240 mg was administered. The BP, HR and mean arterial pressure recovered to 125/80 mm Hg, 95 mm Hg and 80 bpm, respectively, in 8 hours. Then, the percutaneous nephrostomy was performed and the abscess at the UPJ was successfully drained . Urine and blood culture results reported on Day 4 revealed the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ and therefore, the initial treatment of carbapenem was continued. The patient completely recovered in 2 weeks. She finally underwent total left nephroureterectomy on Day 65 with uneventful recovery. The pathological diagnosis revealed a high-grade noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Gross and microscopic pathology.

Treatment of urosepsis associated with obstruction and abscesses requires drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Physiological changes may occur due to the prone position maintained during the drainage, such as increased intraperitoneal pressure and reduced venous return, which can potentially induce complications such as hypotension, arrhythmia, and syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Accordingly, optimal BP must be maintained before such a procedure. In our case, UPJ drainage in the prone position was too invasive with poorly controlled BP after the initiation of norepinephrine. Hence, PMX-DHP along with the administration of hydrocortisone was selected in advance to the drainage. The effect of PMX on septic shock patients with different endotoxin levels is currently being investigated in a clinical study, the results of which are expected to come in 2022 (NCT03901807). It is known that norepinephrine, which is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-adrenergic agonist effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, is the first line of treatment for septic shock hypotension; however, our patient showed catecholamine-resistant hypotension with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. The use of corticosteroids and PMX improved hypoglycemia and hypotension simultaneously before using vasopressin.\n\n【12】ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are resistant to numerous β-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Major risk factors for colonization or infection with ESBL-producing organisms are antibiotic exposure, prolonged hospital stays, and admission in an institution with high rates of third-generation cephalosporin use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

His history included refractory hypertension for 7 years, though he was receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs, including Valsartan (320 mg), Atenolol (50 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), spironolactone (75 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg). He also had a history of intracranial haemorrhage with complete recovery. His family history indicated a deceased cousin due to end-stage renal disease. On examination, he had elevated blood pressure (180/90), a distended but soft abdomen and a liver edge palpable 2 cm below the costal ribs.\n\n【9】Abdominal ultrasonography revealed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in addition to multiple cysts in both kidneys **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>.** These findings were consistent with the ones in Multi-Slice Computerized Tomography (MSCT), in which three variable-sized cystic lesions were detected in both kidneys with a diameter of 32, 38 and 47 mm. The MSCT also showed the AAA that measured 3.6 cm, in addition to prostate hyperplasia. Furthermore, thorax MSCT images showed multiple aneurysms larger than 22 mm arising from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, the left circumflex and the right coronary artery. On echocardiography, there was an eccentric left ventricle hypertrophy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, while the electrocardiogram (ECG) uncovered a prominent left axis deviation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain showed an increased size of the cerebral ventricles in addition to multiple hypertensive lesions of 2–24 mm on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery and T2-Weighted Image. Laboratory tests revealed high levels of serum creatinine (6 mg/dl), urea (105 mg/dl), haemoglobin (9.1 g/dl) and platelets count (187\\*10 <sup>3 </sup> /dl). Twenty-four hours urinalysis showed an additional massive proteinuria of 4200 mg/dl, in addition to a trace of red blood cells without cellular casts in microscopic examination.

Currently, the case is managed with haemodialysis sessions twice a week.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Herein, we report a case of an association between ADPKD and coronary arteries aneurysms (CAA). To our best knowledge, this rare association is only described 16 times in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of ADPKD in our patient was based on the presence of multiple bilateral kidney cysts and extrarenal manifestations (Ravine’s Criteria), after ruling out other possible pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, the clinical course of the disease, the patient’s age and the normal values of inflammatory markers make Kawasaki disease in this patient less likely. On the other hand, patients with ADPKD have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms between 9 and 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, which suggests that the haemorrhagic stroke in our patient was probably underlined by a cerebral aneurysm. Further study with magnetic resonance angiography is recommended. Neves _et al._ deduced in their systematic review that 6 out of 23 ADPKD patients (40%) have multiple coronary aneurysms as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although these multiple involvements of coronary arteries are more frequently reported in ADPKD patients, aneurysms in the other vessels are still quite a rare association in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common associated vascular aneurysm with CAA is an AAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The association between multiple giant coronary aneurysms, which is quite rare, and other aneurysms including the AAA and the suspected cerebral aneurysm makes the presentation of our case extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, because the combination between these three pathologies in the context of ADPKD was never reported before.\n\n【12】Furthermore, the giant cardiac aneurysms were diagnosed accidentally in our patient who did not have any cardiac symptoms, and this is consistent with the findings of the aforementioned systematic review, which showed that 6 out of the 13 patients with coronary artery aneurysms were asymptomatic (21%). This should draw attention towards the significant asymptomatic cardiac manifestations in ADPKD, which might prevent grave prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Although there are many recommendations regarding the isolated AAA and CAA, still such recommendation in the setting of ADPKD are unavailable. Boyer _et al._ recommended the surgical revascularization when a CAA involves the main stem of the left coronary artery, multivessel coronary artery disease is identified, a giant CAA is present or when other cardiac condition mandate surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence showed that all men aged 66 or more should be screened if they have not already been screened or they have one of the mentioned risk factors including hypertension. Additionally, they consider aneurysm repair for people with an unruptured AAA in case of symptomatic aneurysm, asymptomatic and larger than 4.0 cm with a growth by more than 1 cm in 1 year, or asymptomatic measuring ≥5.5 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Rare associations of vessels aneurysms might happen in patients with ADPKD, including the coexistence of AAA, giant multiple coronary aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms. Hypertension also represents a common manifestation of this entity and could be refractory as in our patient. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate for secondary causes in patients with refractory hypertension as early as possible and to screen for asymptomatic aneurysms in cases of ADPKD, in order to prevent serious complications.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Jalal Habash for his support in preparing this report.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), multi-slice computerized tomography (MSCT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the purpose of the publication of this case report and all accompanying images.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Assistant Prof. Sami Albitar.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:32", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:45", "cost": 12.324}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:33"}

Thousands of people undergo investigations daily to explore the possibility of having coronary artery disease. With increasing demand, the range of available investigations to encompass both anatomical and functional tests for ischaemia has expanded in the last two decades. This, however, comes at the risk of replacing clinical acumen. Thus, the very first question a physician needs to answer has remained the same: What is the patient’s risk of having coronary artery disease?\n\n【1】In 1973, when the available tests were very limited, Dr Sanders T. Frank observed a common sign between 20 patients that had presented with angina: the diagonal earlobe crease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After publishing this case series in the New England Journal of Medicine, the sign is often called after his eponym. The sign is a deep wrinkle that can present unilaterally or bilaterally and extends from the tragus to the auricle at a 45° angle, as depicted in Figure 1 . The pathophysiology of the sign has remained a mystery for some time, with theories trying to explain the mechanism of its formation. A recent histological study by Stoyanov _et al._ supports the hypothesis that the presence of Frank’s sign is directly associated with atherosclerosis as the location of the line is formed prenatally and is therefore vulnerable to hypoxia-reoxygenation injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

However, there is still much controversy regarding its clinical relevance and predictive value. A study by Wang _et al._ that included 558 patients demonstrated that Frank’s sign was independently associated with a risk of coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> supported by a more recent single-blind cross-sectional study that included 1000 patients.

Other studies, however, show a weaker association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Despite the questionable sensitivity of the sign, the undeniable fact is that Frank’s sign has been documented throughout history, from the ancient Romans to Renaissance art, right through to modern-day popular culture.

He had a history of dyslipidemia and anxiety disorder, for which he was taking simvastatin and escitalopram. His body temperature was 36.7°C, his pulse was 90 bpm, and his blood pressure was 128/86 mmHg. Neurologic examination revealed that the patient was alert, his cranial nerves were intact, his motor power was grade V in all extremities, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal. Objective sensory deficit was not seen. We suspected COPS with additional thorax involvement. COPS is usually due to a lesion in the thalamocortical projections or thalamus and brainstem. The differential diagnosis of COPS in this patient included lacunar infarction because he had a risk factor for dyslipidemia, hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral vascular malformations such as CMs, and arteriovenous malformations were also possible differential diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|The patient had paresthesia around the corner of the right side of the mouth, and in the hand, foot and lateral thoracic region of the same side.</u>\n\n【7】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined lesion in the left side of the dorsal pons, measuring 1.2 × 1.1 cm and showing T1 hyperintensity without enhancement, T2 hyperintensity with a hemosiderin rim and surrounding edema, and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and was diagnosed with a bleeding CM .

COPS was first described in patients with midbrain and pontine hemorrhagic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A further report documented unilateral sensory disturbances in the thoracic region, in addition to the hand, mouth and foot regions due to lesions in the thalamus and thalamocortical projections; additional symptoms included headache, diplopia and/or hemiparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with very rare COPS with thoracic region involvement without additional symptoms. COPS could be explained by partial involvement of the medial lemniscus, thalamus or thalamocortical projections. In the medial lemniscus in the pons, the closeness of the sensory fibers from the head, arm, trunk and leg can be explained by COPS with thoracic involvement in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient was high risk of misdiagnosis because he presented with unfamiliar sensory symptoms without other abnormal symptoms along with a history of anxiety disorder.\n\n【11】Brainstem CMs account for 20–35% of all CMs and have higher incidence rates of hemorrhaging and re-hemorrhaging than non-brainstem CMs (2.8 vs. 0.3%, and 32.3% vs. 6.3% per patient-year, respectively) and a low mortality rate of 2.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The risk factors of CMs hemorrhaging include young age, female sex, prior hemorrhage and a deep location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice, especially SWI sequences and gradient echo sequences that demonstrate the area of prior hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Brain MRI of our patient showed hyperintensities on both T1-and T2 weighted sequences and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on SWI sequence due to their subacute hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Management options include observation or surgery: surgical resection, radiosurgery or stereotactic laser ablation. Observation may be preferred despite a lesion being symptomatic if the intervention risk is high, such as with deeply located CMs. Postoperative brainstem CMs morbidity occurred in 34.8% including motor deficits, sensory deficits, tracheostomy/gastrostomy requirement and other cranial nerve deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. If repeated hemorrhages lead to progressive neurological morbidity, surgery may be considered. In our patient, observation was considered because he had only sensory symptoms. and the lesion was located in the deep pons, where the morbidity associated with the intervention is high.\n\n【14】We report this case of brainstem CMs presented with isolated COPS with additional thorax involvement to raise awareness of these very rare syndromes. We consider COPS an underreported condition because the mild sensory symptoms can be easily misdiagnosed by a physician, and the patients may not be concerned about their symptoms, which are linked to serious conditions. The occurrence of COPS as a presentation of neurological disease should be investigated in neurological patients, especially stroke patients, to raise awareness and prevent misdiagnosis of serious conditions.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by the Prapokklao Hospital Ethics Committee.

The metallic implant is incompatible with magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, a biopsy of the first mass was taken, which revealed an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma . A bone scan was performed and showed increased tracer uptake only in the left tibia . A whole-body computed tomography scan revealed metastases in the lungs.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The X-ray showed a nail intramedullary in the left tibia, and multiple osteolytic lesions, heterogeneous, poorly limited with permeative destruction of the cortical bone.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Histological examination revealed an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Bone scan showed increased tracer uptake only in the left tibia.</u>\n\n【12】Based on the past history, clinical, imaging and histologic findings, the diagnosis of high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with bone involvement in association with an implanted orthopedic hardware was retained. Consequently, our multidisciplinary team of orthopedists, oncologists and pathologists discussed the different treatment options and, after obtaining the patient’s consent, we opted for radical treatment (transfemoral amputation) and adjuvant chemotherapy for metastasis. After receiving the first dose of chemotherapy, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The follow-up was initially scheduled every 3 months for 1 year, then every year after that. At 6 months follow-up, the patient tolerated the prosthesis well and responded favorably to chemotherapy. Three years later, he is alive and there are no distant metastases and no local recurrences.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】The occurrence of malignancy associated with implanted orthopedic prosthesis or hardware is extremely rare. Until now, approximately 50 cases of sarcoma associated with orthopedic implants have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As compared to the multitude of orthopedic procedures performed each year, this accounts a very small percentage of cases. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not yet clear, it has been reported in animal and human studies that some components of these implants, such as nickel, stainless steel, chromium, cobalt, iron, manganese, selenium, zinc and silicon have carcinogenic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. In addition, other authors assume that implant-induced osteonecrosis contributes to malignancy development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Implant-associated sarcomas were seen in patients of widely varying ages 11–87 years, with a mean age of 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There was no gender dominance. Usually, sarcomas develop between 6 months and 30 years following implant implantation, with a mean interval of 9 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In our case, the interval was 18 years. These sarcomas generally occur around the implant site in the bone or soft tissue adjacent. In terms of location, the femur is the most commonly affected bone, followed by the tibia, pelvis and humerus. In these locations, implanted material is quite frequent, which can explain this distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Histopathology, these tumors are high-grade sarcomas including pleomorphic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, chondrosarcoma and synovial sarcoma. It seems that the type of sarcoma and the implanted material do not correlate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】High-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a rare malignancy. It is usually seen in the 6th and 7th decades. About 75% of these tumors occur in the soft tissues of the extremities mainly in the lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Typically, patients present with an enlarged, painless mass. In 5% of cases, metastases are found at initial presentation as seen in our patient. The primary treatment for these sarcomas is surgical resection en bloc with a margin of normal tissue of 1–2 cm around the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, in some cases, particularly lower extremity sarcomas, amputation is preferred over difficult reconstruction. Moreover, prosthetic techniques have evolved significantly in recent years, resulting in improved tolerance and excellent performance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Radiotherapy can reduce the risk of local recurrences whereas chemotherapy is usually reserved for metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Lastly, it is extremely rare for a malignant tumor to develop in association with an orthopedic implant. Nevertheless, physicians should be aware of this possibility, especially if new symptoms occur related to orthopedic implants.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nil.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare that they don’t have a conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient had given his written consent for publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The guarantor is Dr Abdellatif Benabbouha.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:38:06", "cost": 25.983}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:38:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:40"}

Its use is part of a traditional cleansing ceremony but has been adopted by the alternative health movement.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The rise of the global alternative health movement has seen the spread of many cultural rituals far from their origins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This is problematic as people may undertake such practices unaware of possible risks, steps in preparation or traditional dosages. One such practice is the use of Kambo as a cleansing ritual. Once localized to South America, it is now practiced internationally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department at Sunshine Coast University Hospital (Queensland, Australia) with severe chest and upper abdominal pain associated with protracted vomiting. This occurred after participating in a Kambo demonstration. Initial observations were normal (white cell count, 13.9 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), however, over the next 2 h he demonstrated signs of septic shock. Clinical assessment indicated subcutaneous emphysema of the neck. Concern for Boerhaave syndrome was raised, broad spectrum antibiotic including antifungal therapy was commenced, and a computerized tomography (CT) scan with oral contrast was ordered. The CT scan revealed a perforation at the left lateral aspect of the distal oesophagus with extravasation of contrast into a large posterior mediastinal collection . Urgent operative intervention involved a left posterolateral thoracotomy, revealing a defect in the distal oesophagus and a large mediastinal collection. The defect was closed with interrupted absorbable sutures and several large bore chest drains were placed . A concomitant venting gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy were placed to aid in early commencement of enteral nutrition. A contrast swallow at day 5 showed no ongoing leak, after which an oral diet was gradually recommenced. The patient was discharged 18 days post presentation. A follow-up endoscopy was performed at 3 months, which demonstrated a healed oesophagus.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Large posterior mediastinal fluid and gas collection containing contrast indicating Boerhaave.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Post operative chest X-ray with bilateral chest drains and residual subcutaneous emphysema.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Boerhaave Syndrome is an uncommon and potentially fatal condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology is forceful emesis with sudden elevation of intra-oesophageal pressures resulting in rupture of the oesophagus. In most cases there is no underlying abnormality to the oesophagus, however risk factors include alcoholism and binge eating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A classic triad (Macklers) has been described (chest pain, vomiting and subcutaneous emphysema), but is only present in 27% of presentations so a high degree of clinical suspicion is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Patient outcome is strongly dependent on time to diagnosis, as well as perforation site. A 2010 study based on 27 patients across the 2002–2006 period, showed that perforations treated within 24 h showed a 6% mortality rate, compared with a 40% mortality rate in those diagnosed after 24 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】This is the second published case of Boerhaave’s Syndrome due to Kambo use, and the first reported in Australia. In 2020, a 62-year-old woman in North America presenting with chest pain also demonstrated a rupture requiring surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Kambo originates from South America and is used as part of a cleansing ceremony. It is derived from secretions collected from the frog, _Phyllomedusa bicolor_ and has been found to contain several active peptides including phyllocaeruleins (hypotensive properties), tachykinins and phyllokinins (vasodilators), dermorphins and deltorphins (opiate like actions) and adenoregulins (antiboiotics properties) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The ritual describes drinking a large volume of water then applying Kambo to previously created burns, typically on the arm or thigh. Other complications of use include hepatitis, hyponatraemia and psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8–10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Our patient stated this was the second time he participated in this ritual. Whilst the first was out of curiosity, this occasion was part of a demonstration at a local centre. Both new (dark dots) and old scars are visible in Fig. 3 . He stated the material had been sourced from an international group promoting Kambo use.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Left deltoid Kambo administration site.

Isolated splenic TB is typically found in trauma, miliary TB and immunocompromised status. We present a very rare case of an immunocompetent child with an isolated primary TB in the spleen. The child only had fever of unknown origin (FUO), and mild anaemia. The diagnosis was not made until splenectomy was performed. The patient took the quadruple therapy for TB, and follow-ups showed no recurrence. This case is unique because this child was immunocompetent with no history of trauma or active TB. TB diagnosis should never be ignored in FUO as this might prevent unnecessary procedures to the patient. Although the child was vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin that usually protects against severe TB in first 5 years of life, it did not prevent from affecting the spleen.\n\n【2】BCG vaccination , case report , developing country , fever of unknown origin , spleen , splenectomy , tuberculosis\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Around 20% of tuberculosis (TB) cases have extra pulmonary manifestations which can involve almost any organ, with the nervous and lymphatic systems being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, isolated cases of TB in the spleen are very rare in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. We present a young girl with fever of unknown origin (FUO) that lasted for 2 months. The patient had an isolated splenomegaly, and mild anaemia. When the spleen was surgically removed, she was found to have TB.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 5-year-old girl complained of a continuous fever for 2 months. She did not suffer from a cough, rigour, chills, night sweats or any pain. She did not have any gastric complaints either. She did not miss any of her vaccinations, including Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. The patient had a family of a low socio-economic status. Family history was unremarkable. On examination, she had pallor, and an enlarged spleen. Her height and development were normal according to her age, but the weight was low below the 1st percentile. The patient visited the doctor multiple times and was prescribed antibiotics, and paracetamol but without any improvement.\n\n【7】Her labs showed moderate hypochromic microcytic anaemia with normal platelet and white cell counts, while the lymphocytic cells percentile was (51%). Thick and thin blood smears did not provide additional findings. Liver and kidney function tests were normal, whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 41 mm/hour. However, bone marrow aspiration, haemoglobin electrophoresis, fragility test and direct and indirect Coombs’ tests were normal. Blood culture and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) serology test were negative. Mantoux test showed a 7 mm induration, which was speculated to be a false positive from the TB vaccine. However, QuantiFERON-TB gold test (QFT) was not performed.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray (CXR) was normal. Ultrasonography (US) showed a homogeneous and moderately enlarged spleen. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast showed normal lymph nodes, and the splenomegaly was 15 x 5 cm in size and homogeneous in density. No other abnormalities were detected on the US or CT. The patient was diagnosed with FUO with splenomegaly as no causes were found. The differential diagnosis included leishmaniasis, malaria, infractions and infections.\n\n【9】An open splenectomy was performed to determine the underlying cause of the sizable lesion of the spleen as spleen biopsies are generally avoided in this hospital. Pentaxim, Pneumovax 23, influenza and meningococcal ACWY vaccines were also given prior the surgery. In pathology, caseation necrosis was observed in the granulomas in the hilar lymph nodes . Acid-fast bacteria (AFB) staining was negative, but AFB culture was positive which showed TB. For the next 9 months, the patient was given 10 mg/kg isoniazid, and 15 mg/kg rifampicin, including 2 months of 20 mg/kg ethambutol, and 30–40 mg/kg pyrazinamide. Doses were adjusted during follow-ups when gaining weight. CXRs of the family members were normal, and they had normal Mantoux tests. After treatment was stopped, the patient came for follow-ups every 6 months by CXRs, US, ESR and blood tests, which showed no recurrence, and the patient weight went back to normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Histology of the lesion in the spleen and its hilar lymph nodes.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】TB is more common in developing countries like Syria, and has one of the top 10 highest mortality rates in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.

Trauma, and hematogenous spread from the lungs in miliary TB and from adjacent organs are the methods of infecting the spleen in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In endemic areas, FUO could be the only symptom of a sporadic TB of the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>, and the diagnosis can be misleading as symptoms can be unspecific or absent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】BCG vaccination can prevent having a severe disease in children such as miliary TB, and meningitis. The vaccination can also prevent around 40 000 cases every year before reaching the age of 5 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Diagnosis in our case was made by pathology, the gold standard method of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. BCG vaccine can lead to misinterpretation with Mantoux text but not with QFT. In our case, a biopsy should have been taken prior the surgery as it is an effective methods for diagnosis, and splenectomy could have been avoided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】We hypothesis that TB vaccination might have prevented a more severe form of TB in this patient, but it did not prevent hematogenous spread to the spleen. No QFT was conducted due to the financial hurdles that the patient had, and TB diagnosis was thought to be highly unlikely. Most procedures and medications in the hospital such as surgeries, drug regiments, AFB staining and culture, and the hospital admission are provided for free in Syria, while specific tests such as QFT are not provided for free, and they can be very expensive. This is not the first case to report financial hurdles in Syria that prevented proper diagnosis and management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although Children’s University Hospital is considered the best centre for children in Syria, especially for haematological disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, biopsy from the spleen is avoided in this hospital due to high rates of complications and a lack of experience with this procedure.\n\n【15】Despite splenectomy being rarely required in spleen TB, it may be necessary when an abscess is formed or there is no response to treatment. Furthermore, treatment can continue up to 24 months in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The differential diagnosis of splenomegaly with FUO can be leishmaniasis, malaria, an infract from endocarditis, leukaemia, sickle cell disease, lymphoma and myelofibrosis. Infracts can be difficult to distinguish with imaging alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Malaria is very rare in Syria, and is mainly in the northern provinces where risk is still low. Cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, has are endemic in Syria, and their incidence increased in the last years from the internal displacement from the war 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Moreover, diagnosis is mainly made by demonstrating the parasite in stains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> which were all normal in our study.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】Our patient had fever of unknown origin with an isolated splenomegaly, which was not diagnosed with TB until splenectomy. TB should always be suspected in endemic areas when having FUO, and proper diagnostic tests should never be skipped. A biopsy should be performed when having FUO with a splenomegaly. BCG vaccination can cause confusion with Mantoux test, and it did not protect from hematogenous infection of the spleen in a 5-year-old child. However, it might have protected from a severe form of the TB.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Professor Lina Khoury for her help and support throughout this work.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this study.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DECLARATIONS OF INTEREST\n------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was approved by the ethical commute of Damascus University Faculty of Medicine.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PATIENT PERSPECTIVE\n-------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient’s caregivers thanked the hospital staff for their help and hospitality, and understood the hurdles that faced this case.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was taken for this research.

Alcohol has been established to affect the autonomic function through liver injury and accumulation of vasodilators. Alcohol can induce peripheral neurological diseases as well. This case report describes a patient who had a chronic history of alcoholism and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus presenting for orthostatic hypotension and peripheral neuropathy without underlying liver disease or other endocrinopathies. Although diabetes mellitus was controlled pharmacologically and risk factors for orthostatic hypotension were managed conservatively, his symptoms did not improve which indicated an alcohol-related autonomic dysfunction, shedding light on one of long-term complications of alcoholism.\n\n【2】dysautonomia , neuropathy , alcohol\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】The autonomic nervous system, a division of the peripheral nervous system, coordinates the function of internal organs. It is made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. They are largely responsible for the involuntary, subconscious controls of viscera, smooth muscle and secretory glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Autonomic dysfunction or dysautonomia is a neuropathy affecting the autonomic nervous system. The effect of alcoholism on autonomic function tests have been well established through the mechanism of liver injury. In this case report, we describe a 36-year-old patient, who struggled with alcoholism, and presented with multiple episodes of orthostatic hypotension found to be a sign of autonomic dysfunction exacerbated by alcoholism. Despite treatment and control of the risk factors, the autonomic dysfunction persisted upon a long period of follow-up.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 36-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 3-week history of multiple episodes of dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision and tinnitus after standing up. He also reported an episode of near-syncope with trauma to the head 1 day prior to presentation.\n\n【7】The aforementioned presentation was his third in a period of 3 weeks. He endorsed a 40 kg unintentional weight loss in the past 2 years. He had increased sleep, muscle and bone pains, tingling and numbness of his fingers and in his lower extremities distally to his knees.\n\n【8】Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in January 2017 with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.9% which increased to 10.5% in December 2018 few months before presentation. His diabetes mellitus was being treated with Metformin which he was not compliant with. He also had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated with Gabapentin, right cerebellar gliosis 2/2 to right frontal ventriculostomy along with a history of depression and alcoholism (reports drinking 10 beers per day for 2 years. Each beer is 24 oz. He quit 3 weeks prior to presentation). He did not report any intake of antidepressant therapy or sedatives.\n\n【9】He is a thin, pale man of Asian descent. There were no signs of dehydration such as dry mouth, lips and eyes. Orthostatic blood pressures: 148/97 mm Hg while sitting and 93/64 mm Hg upon standing. Generally normal body and neurological exams. Neurologic exam was normal. Tilt table test was not performed because the hospital does not have the specific facility for the test. Pertinent initial laboratory findings were: HbA1c 10.2%, AST 87 mg/dL and normal ALT. An EKG showed long QT segment with QTc = 0.53 s.\n\n【10】He was admitted for further work-up of dizziness. Twenty-four hour telemetry were unremarkable. No cardiac echocardiography was performed. No dehydration was suspected due to normal laboratory work-up.\n\n【11】During hospitalization, he was evaluated by an endocrinologist and extensive laboratory studies including PTH, 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin B12, Free T4, ACTH, Cortisol, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin and IGF-1 levels all returned normal. Serum aldosterone and renin levels were normal excluding adrenal insufficiency as a cause for orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【12】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to rule out any liver injury secondary to alcohol use was normal. A CT brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial injury. A right cerebellar gliosis was evident along with prior right frontal ventriculostomy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild gliosis in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere underlying a right occipital craniectomy and a mild right frontal gliosis along a prior shunt tract .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|T2 weighted MRI axial image showing right cerebellar gliosis related to a previous surgery.</u>\n\n【14】He worked regularly with physical therapy and was taught posture stabilizing exercises, which improved his functional capacity and ambulatory abilities. He was diagnosed with dysautonomia secondary to alcoholism. His blood pressure improved to 130–140/70–80 mmHg with no significant drop on lying/standing measurements. He was discharged on midodrine 10 mg thrice daily, gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily and thiamine 100 mg daily.\n\n【15】In a 6-month follow-up visit, his HbA1c decreased to 6.5% being on insulin therapy. He denied any further alcohol intake. Although he was compliant to his medications, and was following instructions for management of his varicose veins, he still had intermittent episodes of orthostatic hypotension with blood pressure dropping occasionally to 100/50–60 mmHg. However, he did not report any further near-syncope episode. A gastrointestinal evaluation was scheduled because of significant weight loss.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Alcohol and its metabolites can increase the concentration of vasodilators such as nitric-oxide activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and increasing plasma levels of the vasoconstrictor–angiotensin II at higher doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This will in return increase the sympathetic activity causing an increase in stroke volume as well as cardiac output due to sympathetic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Montforte _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> studied 107 patients who struggled with alcoholism versus 61 control subjects to assess the functions of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems in patients. They found that 26 patients (24.3%) had autonomic neuropathy and 34 (32%) had peripheral neuropathy. They concluded that autonomic and peripheral neuropathies are common among patients with alcoholism, and that alcohol is toxic to both autonomic and peripheral nerves in a dose-dependent manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This is the mechanism that we believe explains our patient’s symptoms as he was consuming over 240 ounces of beer daily for many years. Another study by Matikainen _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> was performed on 28 male patients with alcoholism revealing significant polyneuropathy with neurophysiological findings in 7% of subjects.

Facial angiofibromas are a common cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although angiofibromas are usually asymptomatic, they can be highly disfiguring and may lead to significant psychosocial consequences for affected patients. Treatment for facial angiofibromas is challenging. Rapamycin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a protein that is normally regulated by the products of the tumour suppressor genes _TSC1_ (hamartin) and _TSC2_ (tuberin), which are involved in tuberous sclerosis complex. Mutations in these genes result in mTOR activation, which leads to the formation of benign hamartomas of the internal organs and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The molecular mechanisms by which rapamycin and other mTOR inhibitors decrease tumour size and number in tuberous sclerosis complex have only recently been partially understood. In addition to its recognized immunosuppressive effects, it is suggested that rapamycin may exert its therapeutic effect by decreasing production of the proangiogenic molecule vascular endothelial growth factor, which is implicated in cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several topical formulations have been proposed for the skin lesions, however, the optimal topical formulation has not yet been determined.\n\n【7】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Gilles Safa.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:03:57", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:05", "cost": 8.477}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:03:56"}

So far, many clinical features associated with COVID-19 illness remain under-identified, especially atypical manifestations. It is essential to characterize associated rare symptoms to better recognize complications. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) in severe infection manifesting as a generalized inflammatory reaction and immune response in many body systems, potential involvement of the male urogenital tract by SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.\n\n【2】Herein, we report a case of a pediatric patient with orchiepididymitis associated with COVID-19 infection, emphasizing the importance of considering other manifestations such as genital involvement of MIS-C in children with COVID-19 and highlighting the need to monitor the genitourinary function after infection. Therefore, andrological consultation is necessary to evaluate fertility as a long-term follow-up, especially as the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function are still to be thoroughly researched.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread, rare manifestations rise to our note affecting all age groups. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is still incompletely described, with many gaps in the course and complications of the disease remaining under-recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only one known case of pediatric orchiepididymitis in the setting of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and herein, we report the second of this kind and the first case with orchiepididymitis in a child in the context of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome with confirmed COVID-19 infection (MIS-C).\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 7-year-old boy without remarkable medical history presented to our hospital on December 2020 complaining of high fever (40°C) for more than 3 days, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, general fatigue and bilateral testicular discomfort developing over the past 2 days. At first, acute appendicitis was suspected but was later excluded. On physical examination he had reddish congested oral mucosa, dry cracked lips, pallor, generalized abdominal pain spreading to the iliac fossae, diffuse abdominal tenderness, generalized myalgias, sporadic erythematic rash in the inguinal region, the axilla and on the extremities . There was left-sided scrotal redness, increased warmth and swelling with testicular tenderness and pain which were worse on the left testis and was relieved with elevation, suggesting acute orchiepididymitis. This was confirmed upon consultation with the Urology department, in the absence of trauma.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Erythematosus rash on the right thigh with mildly elevated borders.</u>\n\n【8】Laboratory evaluation revealed lymphopenia: WBC:7 <sup>* </sup> 10 <sup>3 </sup> /ul, Plt:119 <sup>* </sup> 10 <sup>3 </sup> /ul, Lymphocytes:7%, Neutrophils:91%, CRP:131 mg/L. Urinalysis was normal. Chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a small amount of free peritoneal effusion located in the right iliac cavity and a small amount of clear fluid effusion in the scrotum, multiple hypoechogenic spots in the testis, and oedema in the epididymis with enlarged edematous epididymal caput . Scrotal Doppler ultrasonography could not be done in our hospital because of the pandemic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Ultrasonography of the testis shows inhomogeneous structure on echo, multiple hypoechogenic spots in the testis (A,B) and edema in the epididymis with enlarged edematous epididymal caput (C).</u>\n\n【10】The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit as he became hemodynamically unstable. Echocardiography showed pleural and pericardial inflammatory reactions. Computerized Tomography of the chest revealed minor alveolar infiltrations in the lower lobes. Differential Diagnosis was mostly suggestive of MIS-C infection with a very rare manifestation, orchiepididymitis. The school our patient attends documented an outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 infections.\n\n【11】Extended laboratory evaluations were consistent with MIS-C, D-dimer: 9400 ng/ml, procalcitonin: 29.8 ng/ml, Ferritin: 757 ng/ml, Antistreptolysine-O: 102tood units/ml, nasopharyngeal swab (real-time PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was treated as recommended by CDC and WHO Guidelines with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, then Prednisolone for 3 weeks, PPI: Omeprazole IV 1 mg/kg/12 h, IVIG (2 g/kg), Aspirin, Enoxaparin Sodium, Dopamine and Acetaminophen. On Day 3 of hospitalization, symptoms started improving after 12 h of IVIG administration as the generalized pain was lessened, scrotal pain and discomfort decreased gradually. On Day 6, the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and pain-free. Enoxaparin was continued until discharge on Day 10 with a normal blood panel, abdominal and testicular ultrasonography.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Acute orchiepididymitis most often presents unilaterally and results after urinary tract infection, viral infections (such as mumps, rubella, coxsackievirus, varicella, echovirus and cytomegalovirus), trauma or autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The frequency of orchiepididymitis in children has decreased substantially after the administration of mumps-measles-rubella vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Coronaviruses in pediatric patients cause either self-limiting mild infection or more severe infection that affects the whole body. MIS-C can be the severe manifestation in acute infection in children, or it can follow it as an autoimmune response with a severe clinical picture. Although rare, several genitourinary presentations have been reported, in addition to a few complications as a result of hypercoagulable states, such as priapism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】One case of orchiepididymitis secondary to SARS-CoV2 has been reported in a previously healthy 14-year-old male in Italy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; our case is the second orchiepididymitis to be reported so far secondary to COVID-19 infection and is the first to be represented in the context of MIS-C.\n\n【16】Genomic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is 76% identical to SARS-CoV, and they both share the main mechanism for invading cells through Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. ACE2 is mostly expressed in cells of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract and bladder, while the highest mRNA expression of ACE2 is in the testes suggesting that testicular cells might be the potential target of COVID-19. Some studies documented that SARS-Cov was detected in testicular epithelial cells and Leydig cells and caused orchitis, testicular lesions and widespread testicular germ cell destruction over a decade ago with subsequent spermatogenic tubule destruction, oligospermia and azoospermia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in the semen and testes and has been successfully isolated from the urine of COVID-19 patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. This might lead to orchiepididymitis by vas deferens reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, there are reports of scrotal discomfort and pain in males with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】During active viremia and persistent fever, the blood–testis barrier is tampered, thus raising the possibility of viral access to the male reproductive tract, notwithstanding, the systemic infection condition that causes an immunocompromised state could be responsible for the orchiepididymitis and other genitourinary manifestations or at least facilitate its presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. One study showed that COVID-19 caused immune impairment similar to the autoimmune orchitis observed previously in SARS-CoV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u> and documented impaired spermatogenesis in COVID-19 patients, which could later impair gonadal function and impact fertility in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, ‘are these results applicable to pediatric patients’ is an important question to be addressed. While complications of orchiepididymitis in normal children are infertility, testicular atrophy, and less commonly abscess formation, testicular infarction and reactive hydrocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, studies should investigate possible future complications of the genitourinary implication on patients infected with SARS-CoV in their childhood, especially as the role of ACE2 receptors is still incomplete at a young age and the gonadal function is yet to develop.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】As the SARS-CoV2 pandemic continues, clinicians should be aware that unusual presentations and rare complications are mostly under-recognized. The virus exhibits possible pathogenicity to testicular tissues; therefore, clinicians should pay attention to testicular complaints and must conduct future clinical follow-up and gonadal function evaluation, especially in patients who are at reproductive age.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgments.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was provided.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is needed.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Parental approval was provided.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Mariana Haydar is the guarantor of the paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:01", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:18", "cost": 16.807}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:00"}

She was diagnosed with ASS based on the presence of arthritis, ILD, anti-Jo1 and antiRo52 autoantibodies. She was maintained on 6-monthly Rituximab cycles (one 1gm infusion repeated 15 days after the first for each cycle), completed two cycles, last given 6 months prior to her presentation. In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic the third cycle was withheld and Azathioprine was commenced which she took for 2 weeks. Two weeks prior to her admission Azathioprine was switched to an up titrating dose of Mycophenolate due to nonspecific symptoms of headache and dizziness attributed to possible medication intolerance. She was admitted with fever, abdominal pain and headaches. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia (38.3C), hypotension (109/70 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 94 bpm) and palmar maculopapular rash. Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia, Hb 100 (115–165 g/L), WCC 2.40 (4–11 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), Platelets 61 (150–450 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), Neutrophils 1.75 (2–7 × 10 <sup>9/L </sup> ), lymphocytes 0.50 (1– 4 × 10^9/L), Ferritin of >55 000 (15–300 ug/L), Triglycerides 4.3 (1.8 mmol/L), LDH 1200 (135–214 IU/L), Fibrinogen 2.8 g/l(normal), ALT 108 (<34 IU/L), CRP 141 (0–6 mg/L) and ESR 24 mm/hr.\n\n【6】A septic screen for common bacterial and viral pathogens including parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis was negative. Multiple covid-19 swabs were negative. Computed tomography of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or an underlying malignancy. Lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, evolving pancytopenia, elevated ferritin and persistent fever with patient’s background history of autoimmune disease raised concerns about MAS. She fulfilled the 2014 HScore by Fardet _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> with a score of 199 (cut off 169), Treatment with IV methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days was initiated followed by oral prednisolone, 60 mg along with ciclosporin 2 mg/kg/d. She had a history of type 2 diabetes, was on oral hypoglycaemic medications but developed hyperglycaemia and ketosis secondary to steroid and required Insulin therapy. Anakinra 100 mg once daily subcutaneously was added after Multidisciplinary team discussion to reduce steroid toxicity and facilitate a rapid steroid taper, whilst providing optimal disease control. Immediate clinical improvement was noted with normalization of fevers and gradual normalization of laboratory abnormalities including ferritin, cell counts  and inflammatory markers. We believe an underlying rheumatic immune disorder was the likely predisposing factor for the development of MAS in our patient, as she was not maintained on biologic/immunomodulatory therapy due to paused Rituximab in view of COVID-19 pandemic and possible intolerance to various agents.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|H score.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Progression of serum ferritin and white cell count.</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by an unregulated inflammatory response with cytokine storm leading to multisystem organ failure and can be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly. HLH can be familial (primary) or acquired (secondary to infection, malignancy or active autoinflammation). Secondary HLH (sHLH) in association with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, adult-onset Still disease, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is known as MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, it is rarely seen in patients with ASS and has been described only in case reports where most patients reportedly suffered from dermatomyositis. Anti- Jo-1, anti- Mi-2 and anti-MDA-5 autoantibodies have been found in cases of idiopathic inflammatory myositis complicated by MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis is often challenging due to clinical manifestations mimicking sepsis, active autoimmune diseases and lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Various tools have been developed which use clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities to risk-stratify patients but have limitations. The H-score by Fardet _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> has been validated for the diagnosis of reactive HLH and subsequently showed good diagnostic accuracy in an observational study by Knaak _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, clinical judgement and awareness of the condition remains paramount in diagnosis. Timely diagnosis and treatment to reduce systemic inflammation is imperative to reduce high mortality. High-dose glucocorticoid monotherapy is usually the first line treatment with subsequent addition of immunomodulatory agents in refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Over recent years, various biologics and immunotherapies have been used successfully for MAS treatment. This also includes Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist used in various autoinflammatory diseases. Although limited, there are now case reports and series showing favourable response to anakinra, both subcutaneously and intravenously in sHLH subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Its use is also appealing due to relatively short half-life that permits its discontinuation if an adverse effect occurs or concern for worsening infection arises.\n\n【11】Our case was challenging as patient initially manifested joint symptoms with positive immunology for RA and later developed ILD with positive ASS immune profile in the absence of clinical myositis, typical skin rash and normal CK levels. Aminoacyl tRNA positivity has been described in patients who fulfilled RA diagnostic criteria in the literature and hence ASS is an important clinical condition in the differential diagnosis of early RA. It has been reported that development of myositis can take years after onset of arthritis and ILD, which are also not rarely seen before myositis and in some myositis never occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The most common arthritis pattern seen in ASS is small joint symmetrical polyarthritis quite similar what seen in RA. AntiCCP and rheumatoid factor positivity can be observed in ASS and lead to false RA diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. On the other hand, established knowledge that ASS is seen in cases with classical RA is quite limited. Current literature regarding the use of anakinra in cases of adult MAS is limited, further information regarding its effectiveness and potential clinical benefits and risks is needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, however, we had a successful response and outcome in resistant MAS associated with ASS using anakinra.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No specific funding was received from any funding bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>An informed consent for publication has been obtained, Identifying details of the.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient have not been used in this case report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Nadia Ahmad, nadiaahmad@ live.co.uk</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, Rheumatology.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:38", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:55", "cost": 16.545}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:34", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:38"}

Metastases to the thyroid gland are rare, representing less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies. Here, we report a case of a 69-year-old Asian man who had both thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders but no nodules/tumours in the lung field. The patient died 51 days after his first visit to our office, although pembrolizumab was administered on day 34 based on programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with paired box 8 (PAX8) may be useful to diagnostically distinguish poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas from napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cancers of unknown primary (CUPs) are metastatic tumours whose primary site cannot be identified during pretreatment evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Common primary sites for thyroid metastases include the kidneys, head, neck (squamous cell carcinomas), lung and breast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of neck stiffness at his first visit to our office and died after an aggressive disease course. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed no nodules/tumours in the lung field but thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies from the thyroid tumour and from a subcutaneous tumour in the left shoulder revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) suggested that the tumour was likely a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 69-year-old Asian man was referred to our office for neck stiffness and persistent coughing for over a month. His past medical history was significant for gastric and duodenal ulcers that improved after _H. pylori_ eradication. He had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 50 years. His physical examination revealed subcutaneous, board-like indurations and nodules/tumours without bilateral supraclavicular and cervical tenderness.\n\n【8】Contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland (i.e. a thyroid tumour), which displaced the trachea to the left side and subcutaneous nodules/tumours that displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle anteriorly . High-resolution CT scanning revealed no nodules/tumours in the lung field as shown in Video 1 of the supplementary material . To clarify the cytopathological features of the subcutaneous nodules/tumours, the patient was referred to our otolaryngologist, who performed fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies on the subcutaneous tumour in the left supraclavicular region as well as on the thyroid tumour .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Contrast-enhanced CT scan showing the thyroid tumour (yellow arrow) and subcutaneous nodules/tumours in the left supraclavicular region .

Table 1 summarizes the IHC results for pan-keratin antibodies AE1 and AE3 (AE1/3), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, vimentin, calretinin, p40, paired box 8 (PAX8), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). (PAX8 staining was performed after the patient was deceased.)

TTF-1 and napsin A positivity are reported to reliably enable distinguishing primary from metastatic tumours of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Napsin A expression was less intense and partially positive in the patient, while TTF-1 was positive . Napsin A has a higher specificity of 96% but a lower sensitivity of 65% for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma compared with TTF-1 expression (81% for each measure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas may be napsin A-positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. TTF-1 is also positive in thyroid tumours, regardless of histologic type, and in lung carcinomas, including 75% of adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, PAX8 may have a crucial role in diagnostically distinguishing napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas from lung adenocarcinomas, which are PAX8 negative, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. PAX8 stain positivity is also diagnostically useful for müllerian, renal, and thymic carcinomas and pancreatic endocrine tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Further, thyroglobulin staining might be useful for distinguishing thyroid from lung primaries if differentiation to mature thyroid glands is partially preserved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Pembrolizumab was reported to result in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The patient, however, died 17 days after receiving pembrolizumab. Since the time to response for pembrolizumab is 1.4 to 8.2 months (median, 2.2 months) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, using pembrolizumab to treat CUPs may be difficult even if the tumour cells show a strong intensity and are 100% positive for PD-L1 expression.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Tomohiro Goda, Department of Medical Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine for the ALK, PD-L1 and PAX8 staining and for the genetic analyses of the EGFR gene and ROS1 gene fusion.

A 22-year-old patient presented with very fast and very slow atrial ectopic activity. He complained of repetitive episodes of fast tachycardia, some accompanied with dizziness.\n\n【2】When the ectopic discharge was slow, no clear-cut difference between the sinus rate and the ectopic rate was seen and thus the atrial rhythm appeared quite regular. The ectopic focus was situated deep inside the right upper pulmonary vein (RSPV).\n\n【3】After RSPV isolation a persistent sinus rhythm was established and since then the patient has been asymptomatic for 3 years.\n\n【4】Thus, subtle changes in the P wave morphology without a significant change in the heart rate in patients presenting with palpitations can give a clue to the diagnosis of the tachycardia and the localization of the ectopic focus.\n\n【5】cardiac electrophysiology\n\n【6】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【7】Subtle changes in the P wave polarity combined with slight changes in the heart rate are often considered to represent a shift of the origin of the impulse within the sinus node itself.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 22-year-old man was referred to us for drug resistant atrial tachycardia during exercise since 4–5 years. The rate of the tachycardia had been measured up to 250 bpm inducing marked dizziness. Slower ectopic rhythms around 100 bpm were also recorded. Various degrees of atrioventricular block could also be seen during tachycardia. The patient was initially treated with flecainide 100 mg bid but since 3–4 months the tachycardia recurred many times a week lasting from 1 minute to a couple of hours. There was no past medical history. Physical examination was normal. The echocardiogram was normal, too.\n\n【10】An electrophysiological study was performed.\n\n【11】Initially, only supraventricular premature beats were seen. Compared with sinus rhythm, there was a slight reduction in the amplitude of the positive P in Lead 1, the P waves were more positive in Lead 2, Lead 3, AVF, the P waves were inverted in AVL compared with sinus rhythm and there was a change in polarity of the P wave in V1 from biphasic positive negative to positive .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(A) One atrial premature beat (APD) shows a slight reduction of the positive P wave amplitude in Lead 1, increase of the positivity in Lead 1, Lead 3, AVF, negativation of the P wave in AVL and positivation in V1 compared with sinus rhythm.

The P wave polarity is similar to that of the atrial premature beats.</u>\n\n【13】A non-sustained atrial tachycardia at 220 bpm with 2/1 block occurred after atrial burst pacing and showed P waves of the same polarity as the premature beats .\n\n【14】At times, a slow regular atrial rhythm around 45 bpm was seen with alternating sinus and ectopic rhythm .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Slow regular atrial rhythm around 45 bpm. Two morphologies of P waves can be seen. One (E) is similar to the ectopic rhythm recorded during the fast tachycardia and the premature atrial beats. One sinus beat can also be seen (S).</u>\n\n【16】Intracardiac measurements showed that during the premature beats and the tachycardia the high right atrium and the coronary sinus os were activated simultaneously and that the lateral wall of the right atrium was late.\n\n【17】At that point of time, the differential diagnosis based on right atrial mapping was: a focus in the right interatrial septum, a focus in the non-coronary aortic cusp, a focus in the left interatrial septum, a focus in the right upper pulmonary vein. The earliest atrial activation during the arrhythmia was found in the high right septal area with a prematurity of minus 30 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave. Pacing at that site was the best site to reproduce closely the timing and the morphology of the right intra atrial and coronary sinus electrograms during the arrhythmia.\n\n【18】One radiofrequency application at that site was unsuccessful. The left atrium was accessed via transseptal puncture. A Biosense Lasso catheter was positioned in the right superior pulmonary vein (RPSV) as well as a Biosense Thermocool Smarttouch D curve ablation catheter. These catheters were connected to a 3D electroanatomical system (Carto3, Biosense Webster, USA).\n\n【19】After placement of the Lasso in the RSPV, at the antero–inferior part of the Lasso (electrodes 7–10), small fragmented potentials with a prematurity of minus 100 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave during extrasystoles were seen. There was also an inversion of the normal sequence of RPSV activation: the venous potential preceded the far field atrial potential on the premature beats , demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The Lasso catheter (PV1–2 = > 9–10) is positioned at the ostium of the right superior pulmonary vein. PV 1–2 records the roof of the vein. One sinus beat (S) followed by one ectopic beat (E) is seen. The Lasso recording shows a normal sequence of activation on the sinus beat: a far field atrial activity (A) followed by a pulmonary vein potential (PV). The ectopic beat shows an inversion of the sequence of activation (PV precedes A) with fragmented PV potentials (PV 7–10) preceding the far field atrial potentials (A) and the beginning of the P wave by 100 ms and also preceding the other PV potentials recorded by the Lasso catheter demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin of the ectopy.</u>\n\n【21】We could also see an alternation of sinus rhythm and RPSV regular atrial rhythm around 43 bpm with inversion of the normal sequence of activation of the pulmonary vein on the abnormal beats .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|A regular atrial rhythm at 43 bpm is seen.

On Lasso PV 1–2 the inversion of the normal sinus sequence of activation (A-PV) can be seen during the ectopy (PV-A). This change is magnified at 100 mm/s on Fig. 3 .</u>\n\n【23】The RPSV was isolated with an encircling lesion. After isolation was completed, a slow irregular dissociated rhythm with a cycle length between 380 and 680 ms was visible inside the vein. Mapping the dissociated rhythm within the RSPV with the ablation catheter showed fragmented potentials preceding the earliest Lasso activation by 35 ms.

Pulmonary vein tachycardia has been shown to be associated with slow and fast ventricular rhythms in a limited number of cases. In some cases, it is, as in our case, due to slow and fast firing of the ectopic focus (3 cases described) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. In two of them however the focus was situated in the left superior pulmonary vein. In some cases permanent rapid pulmonary venous firing mimicking sinus tachycardia caused heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】As far as the polarity of the ectopic P wave is concerned, it was in accordance with the RSPV localization suggested by Yamane _et al._ in their study on pulmonary venous pacing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Kistler _et al._ found in 27 cases that in the case of pulmonary venous ectopy 39% of the ectopic rhythms were coming from the RSPV and 39% from the left superior pulmonary vein. They also found that 93% of the pulmonary venous foci were ostial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This was not the case in our patient where the focus was situated inside the vein.\n\n【30】The main take home message is the following: changes in the polarity of the P waves, even subtle, despite a slow regular atrial rhythm should raise attention in patients complaining of paroxysmal tachycardia and could be a clue to the presence of an ectopic focus responsible for the complaints.\n\n【31】The polarity of the P wave may help in localizing the origin of the focus.\n\n【32】This also illustrates the ability of the RPSV to generate very slow or very fast ectopic rhythms in the same patient.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.

In this article, we introduce a challenging case that clarifies the characteristics of this malignancy and the methods we used in diagnosing, examining and treating it.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】We report the case of a 49-year-old Syrian female, who was admitted to our hospital due to a painful huge lump in her right breast that had rapidly enlarged in the last 2 months without any signs of skin changes or nipple discharge. The patient denied any history of trauma, but she underwent a surgery to remove a benign ovarian cyst 15 years ago. In addition, her medical and family history were insignificant. Physical examination revealed a painful firm mass in the medial half of her right breast with painful nodular formations beside the areola and in the right axilla. Laboratory findings showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas all other results were normal. Breast ultrasonography (US)  showed a hypoechoic lobulated mass with heterogeneous content measuring 14 cm in diameter, localized in the medial half of the right breast, along with another nodular formation near the areola and two enlarged lymph nodes at the right axillary region. Pleural US revealed mild bilateral pleural effusion. Abdominal US was normal. Chest computed tomography (CT)  showed a tumor infiltrating the chest wall with a metastatic lesion in her right lung, whereas abdominal and pelvic CTs were normal. Consequently, radiographic and clinical findings were highly suggestive of breast carcinoma, which was our primary differential diagnosis. Therefore, the patient underwent a core needle biopsy, which revealed a specimen consists of seven soft to rubbery white-yellowish, ivory-white cores of tissue ranging from 6 to 15 mm length. Microscopic exam revealed heterologous epithelioid and spindle components including myxoid, chondroid, osseous and fibrous differentiations , with a wide range of atypia, extending from minimal atypia to frankly malignant. In addition to high-grade spindle cell lesion  with pleomorphic nuclei and occasional mitotic figures, including atypical mitoses, there were also foci of necrosis. These findings correlate with breast sarcoma, but immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for vimentin (VIM) , P63 , CK5/6  and pancytokeratin (Pan-CK) , whereas ER, PR and HER2 were all negative, Ki67 ~ 30% , which in turn, ruled out the breast sarcoma and confirmed the diagnosis of MBC. Clinical TNM stage of T4N1M1 was given. Based on the radiological and clinical findings, as well as the advanced tumor stage, which all indicate a poor prognosis, radical mastectomy and chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin were performed as a palliative treatment. Then the patient will be monitored at periodic intervals of 3 months for the first 2 years.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Breast US shows a hypoechoic lobulated mass with heterogeneous content, measuring 14 cm in diameter.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest CT shows a high-density mass in the right breast infiltrating the chest wall, accompanied with a metastatic lesion in the right lung.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Tumor nests interspersed with chondromyxoid matrix (hematoxylin and eosin \\[H&E\\] ×400).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Metaplastic carcinoma composed of high-grade spindle cells with angulated hyperchromatic nuclei in a collagenous stroma.

It has a unique IHC pattern includes positivity of VIM and Pan-CK and negativity of ER, PR and Her2neu 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The 2011 WHO classified MBC into the following subtypes: low-grade adeno-squamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, MBC with mesenchymal differentiation, spindle cell carcinoma and fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma, noticing that a large portion of MBCs reveal a mixture of different elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A cohort study showed that the most common subtype was matrix-producing carcinoma, followed by squamous and spindle cell carcinomas, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases present with rapidly growing masses >2 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and very few ones present with axillary lymph nodes metastases with an incidence ranging from 6 to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Most cases had patients with a median age extending from 48 to 59 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, with a median size of 3 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Studies revealed that the accurate diagnosis of MBC is low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. So that, patients with MBCs tend to be diagnosed with a higher tumor stage except for fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, which are usually detected at early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Sonography demonstrates a heterogeneous, hypoechoic solid mass or a mass with a mixture of cystic and solid compounds as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Histologically, the primary differential diagnosis includes myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma and adenomyoepithelioma. In contrast with MBCs subtypes with squamous differentiation, mesenchymal subtypes require IHC staining to be differentiated from breast sarcoma. The mesenchymal subtypes have co-expression of mesenchymal (VIM) and epithelial cell (CK) markers, which distinguish it from breast sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, MBCs show more benign features comparing to invasive ductal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We should keep in mind that it is essential to differentiate MBC from phyllodes tumor, which has a leaf-like growth pattern in addition to negativity of CK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The main treatment of MBC is surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and despite being a chemo-resistant tumor, chemotherapy is administered in 53.4–73.1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In conclusion, our case revealed a tumor characterized by a large size on presentation, which rapidly enlarged in a short period of time, accompanying with metastatic lesions seen in the nearby structures such as the lung and the axillary lymph nodes, as well as a triple negative pattern and a sarcoma-like pattern on microscopic exam; leading to sub-optimal response to systemic therapies. On the other hand, palliative treatment was performed due to the very poor prognosis.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Self-funding.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable for case reports at our institution.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We had a written consent from the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Zuheir Alshehabi is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:18", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:26", "cost": 8.814}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:16"}

Dilated fundus examination (DFE) OD revealed posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and RRD in three quadrants with retinal folds and RT at 12:00 and 1:00 o’clock at the periphery. Vitreoretinal surgery was offered to the patient. One month later, SRRRD was diagnosed  and retinal laser coagulation (RLC) was performed around RT.

However, they pointed out that detached retina with vitreous traction and fixed retinal folds showed an insignificant tendency toward spontaneous reattachment.\n\n【26】De Jong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> concluded that limiting head and eye movements is enough to prevent RRD progression, but it should not be counted as an only contributing factor to SRRRD; the authors supposed that the gravitational force effect on the retina and subretinal fluid is small because of the no density difference between them.\n\n【27】Some studies have suggested that the basis for the development of SRRRD presumably involves the occurrence of a complete PVD that in most cases relieves vitreoretinal traction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Inflammatory response to RT in addition to RRD triggers microglial and Müller cells migration and their massive proliferation at the vitreoretinal interface to establish a glial scar that closes RT and, in our opinion, facilitates developing SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> suggested that, after a partial PVD that relieves vitreoretinal traction, vitreous fibers running parallel to the retinal plane may close RT and interrupt the fluid inflow; in another words, the occurrence of PVD with a consequent RT plugging; subsequently, RPE removes residual subretinal fluid by active transport and/or by Starling force (the balance between capillary pressure, interstitial pressure, and osmotic pressure) that is conducive to SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our study patients were not limited in head and eye movement or neither in a bed position, they had various types of RT, one patient had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, one patient had no PVD; the clinical variability of the SRRRD may contradicts studies above.\n\n【29】There were several limitations in our study. First, the limited number of the cases and retrospective nature of this study. Second, all patients were not comprehensively examined by imaging tools with focus imaging of RT and detachment before SRRRD to determine the pathogenesis of SRRRD. We recognize and do not undermine the importance of vitreoretinal surgery in RRD; we strongly recommended surgery to all our patients.\n\n【30】To summarize, SRRRD is a rare event in ophthalmologist’s practice, accumulating case reports may provide significant information in understanding the current phenomenon. In certain cases, persistent reattachment of the retina after RRD without any intervention is possible. The mentioned clinical cases indicate the possibility of finding new approaches to RRD management.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.

This short-lived cholinesterase inhibitor interacted with amiodarone and caused a previously undocumented prolonged complete atrioventricular block that resolved 48 hours after both drugs’ discontinuation. The neostigmine amiodarone interaction warrants clinical vigilance and is speculated to be due to their partially shared second messenger pathway involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis could maintain hemodynamic stability perioperatively.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Timely diagnosis of amyloidosis can be a challenge. The first manifestations, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, should raise suspicion as they may occur many years before cardiac involvement which is very common and associated with increased mortality. Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple manifestations, including restrictive cardiomyopathy, angina and conduction abnormalities. Often, suspicion arises from the granular appearance of the myocardium in cardiac ultrasound. The cardiac walls are thick while the QRS voltages are low. Ischemia in these patients frequently results from small vessel disease, whereas the epicardial vessels are typically spared. When the latter are involved, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been associated with intractable circulatory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal tract has multiple manifestations as well. They include abdominal pain and distention, tenderness, malabsorption, bowel dilatation, mesenteric adenopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO). Surgery has been suggested as the last resort for the latter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, which is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Neostigmine has been proven invaluable for the treatment of intestinal pseudo-obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, yet it has been inculpated for several side-effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, such as arrhythmia, while some of its interactions may remain unknown.\n\n【5】We, hereby, present an amyloidosis patient with iatrogenic left main stem dissection who survived urgent CABG. Postoperative management with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation (AF), and neostigmine for IPO led to a previously undocumented, prolonged complete atrioventricular block with potentially grave consequences, had it not been for the pacemaker.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 74-year-old male presented with exertional angina. He was a well-built farmer in no distress, complaining of intermittent substernal pain and peripheral edema. His medical history was significant for constipation and prostatic hyperplasia treated with silodosin. The clinical and laboratory tests were within normal limits but imaging was revealing . The electrocardiogram showed trifascicular block . The ultrasonography revealed thickened cardiac walls, small pericardial effusion and biatrial enlargement. Thus, suspicion of amyloidosis was raised. The ejection fraction by Simpson’s biplane method was estimated to 50%, with no regional wall motion abnormality. However, longitudinal myocardial systolic strain by 2D speckle tracking showed far more significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Global longitudinal strain measured −13.2% (normal −15.9% to −22.1%) and regional strain values were greatly reduced in the basal and mid LV, yet preserved at the LV apex. The coronary angiogram, using 6Fr Judkins right 4, and Judkins left 4 catheters, demonstrated two vessel disease, but it was complicated with dissection of the left main stem. The initial attempts for bailout stenting failed, thus urgent surgery was indicated despite the unfavorable results in amyloidosis patients.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Preoperative imaging. At the left, the cardiac ultrasound demonstrated the sparkling pattern of the thickened myocardial walls, especially the intraventricular septum (red arrow) (video online). The atria were enlarged (asterisks). In the middle, the global longitudinal strain was measured −13.2% against a normal range of −15.9% to −22.1%. Regional strain values were greatly reduced in the basal and mid LV, yet preserved at the LV apex. At the right, the coronary angiography was complicated with dissection of the left main stem (black arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Preoperative electrocardiogram showing trifascicular block.</u>\n\n【10】The patient underwent urgent grafting of the left anterior descending and the obtuse marginal arteries, while temporary epicardial pacing wires were placed as part of the standard surgical procedure. Biopsy specimens were collected  and confirmed light chain amyloidosis. The patient was extubated on the first postoperative day (POD). The perioperative fluid management was meticulous to prevent hemodynamic deterioration, bet- blockers were not administered, and silodosin was withheld to avoid hypotensive vasodilation. Mild positive fluid balance was the mainstay of early postoperative management, and electrolyte control was tight.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Amyloid deposits were found in atrial and ventricular walls.

There were decreased bowel sounds and no tenderness on palpation. The abdominal x-rays revealed small bowel ileus  and the computerized tomography showed no evidence of mechanical obstruction, suggesting IPO. Bowel rest, intravenous (IV) fluids, avoidance of opioids, administration of IV metoclopramide, nasogastric tube placement and low enemas were unsuccessful. Gastrografin per os and repeat colonic evacuation provided only partial relief. The distressed patient lapsed into atrial fibrillation on POD 5 and was managed with IV amiodarone. The loading dose was 5 mg/min (300 mg in 1 hour), and the maintenance dose was 0.65 mg/min (900 mg in 23 hours) to 0.83 mg/min (1200 mg in 24 hours). These rates of IV infusion did not affect the pre-existing heart block. On POD 7, sinus rhythm was restored and amiodarone was changed to per os.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Dilated bowel loops with fluid levels on the fifth POD. The intestinal pseudo-obstruction was resolved with acetylcholinesterase blockage.</u>\n\n【14】On POD 7, IV neostigmine was administered, despite the concern of complete heart block. The loading dose was 2.5 mg over a few minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg per day. If block occurred, it was anticipated to be brief. This calculated risk evolved into a sustained threat attributed to a yet unknown interaction between amiodarone and neostigmine. On POD 9, the IPO resolved at the expense of a complete heart block. Neostigmine and amiodarone were discontinued and the pacemaker kept the heart beating. Despite expectations, return to sinus rhythm was significantly delayed. Even though neostigmine has a half-life of up to 2 hours, its interaction with amiodarone caused a prolonged complete heart block that persisted ~2 days after the discontinuation of both. The rest of the course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on aspirin 160 mg/day, furosemide 20 mg/day and esomeprazole 40 mg/day. He was referred for hematologic evaluation and further management. At 1 month follow-up, he was still in good general condition. Given the significant cardiac involvement and advanced age, the patient was deemed ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. He was treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD). Diuretic therapy was maintained.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】PCI is strongly preferred for patients with cardiac amyloidosis that require coronary revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, CABG is inevitable under certain conditions, as the case presented herein. It was demonstrated that circulatory failure can be evaded with meticulous perioperative fluid and drug management. Beta-blockers were withheld. Amiodarone monotherapy was event free with IV infusion rates that are much lower than the recommended dose for life-threatening arrhythmias (15 mg/min for 10 minutes). Silodosin, a selective a1A adrenoceptor antagonist, was also withheld to avoid its hypotensive side-effect and the recognized detrimental interaction with amiodarone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Early postoperatively, the patient developed IPO. This acute, life threatening condition is typically associated with gastrointestinal amyloidosis and poor outcomes in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Neostigmine was administered, as the last resort before urgent bowel surgery, and it was proven effective. The conversion of the preoperative trifascicular block to a complete heart block by neostigmine was anticipated. However, coadministrating amiodarone led to the significant prolongation of the block, which was not anticipated, and to an extended dependence on the external pacemaker.\n\n【18】Coadministrating neostigmine and amiodarone appears to have a previously unreported, prolonged drug–drug effect on the cardiac conduction system. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, thus the parasympathetic output to the atrioventricular nodal cells is enhanced by increased acetylcholine concentration. Acetylcholine acts on the muscarinic-2 receptors which mediate, via Gi proteins, a strong inhibition of adenylyl cyclase which leads to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), decreased intracellular calcium, and blunted excitability. This effect on atrioventricular nodal cells is further exacerbated by amiodarone. This drug’s inhibition of the delayed rectifier outward potassium current at phase 3 of the action potential describes its chronic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The acute effect is mediated by decreasing the activity of the L-type calcium channels and blocking the beta 1 adrenergic receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, thus inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and decreasing cAMP, as neostigmine does, though via Gs proteins.\n\n【19】The take home messages include avoidance of amiodarone and neostigmine coadministration in patients without a pacemaker, especially those with conduction disease. Should this prolonged bradyarrhythmia be triggered, its prognosis depends on the hemodynamic impact and the prompt implantation of a pacemaker. In the presence of a temporary pacemaker, amiodarone and neostigmine management might be considered as the prognosis of this bradyarrhythmia appeared good. A permanent pacemaker would render this drug–drug interaction clinically irrelevant. It was also shown that post-CABG prognosis of patients with cardiac amyloidosis might be good if perioperative fluid and drug management is meticulous.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.

Subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD) was listed in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> as an alternative therapeutic option with a class-IIa recommendation in patients for whom is indicated ICD not requiring pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronization therapy or anti-tachycardia pacing. However, problems and complications associated with the device are relevant and may lead to a poor prognosis. Transvenous electrodes of ICDs have caused problems such as lead injury and infection, myocardial damage and pericarditis. S-ICD is a completely extra thoracic and extravascular system. Therefore, it can be removed even if infection of a pacemaker occurs. Little has been reported on lead dislodgement with S-ICD. We experienced lead dislodgement of S-ICD within 1 month following the two-incision technique in a patient with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT is a relatively rare genetic arrhythmia disorder. Using the two-incision technique for lead fixation to active and sporting patients may induce lead dislodgement, and the three-incision technique may be preferable.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 16-year-old male visited our hospital complaining of fainting during swimming and exercise. He almost drowned during swimming and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation twice. He belonged to the baseball club and was a pitcher and batter. No special abnormalities were identified in the 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia appeared frequently during a treadmill testing . CPVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u> was suspected and so he was treated with flecainide and carvedilol. In addition, genetic testing at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (Suita, Japan) revealed a point mutation in exon8 of the ryanodine (RYR2) receptor. He was admitted at our hospital for implantation of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD). Screening of the body surface using an ECG screening tool determined eligibility for S-ICD. The two-incision technique was selected from a cosmetic point of view that wounding of young patients should be less. The implantation was performed in an electrophysiology laboratory under general anesthesia. Extra-thoracic lead of S-ICD was placed using a two-incision technique. The sleeve of the xiphoid incision was fixed firmly with ETHIBOND EXCEL® polyester suture. The position of the defibrillation lead was confirmed by chest X-ray . The patient was discharged on day 7 post-implantation. Telemedicine monitoring was performed via the LATITUDE ™ system. Although he was prohibited from exercising, he was unable to comply and was participating in baseball games the day following discharge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Twelve-lead ECG displayed in the treadmill test, and two types of ventricular arrhythmias appeared on the electrocardiogram during the exercise load, namely, the lower and the upper axis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|(A) Chest X-ray showing that the extra thoracic lead and generator of S-ICD were first located in the left lateral side; (B) outpatient chest X-ray showed dislodgement of the defibrillation electrode leads in the Para sternum; (C) chest X-ray after replacement of S-ICD using a three-incision technique.</u>\n\n【11】Outpatient chest X-ray showed dislodgement of an extra-thoracic lead . The lead dropped out during the outpatient examination at 3 weeks post-implantation, and the lead tip was in the lower one third of the sternum.

Immediately after re-hospitalization, the dropped S-ICD lead was removed the next day and re-placed by a three-incision technic under intravenous anesthesia .\n\n【12】The alternative EGM in the remote monitoring SMARTPASS was later found to have changed the polarity of the QRS from positive to negative, and remote monitoring could detect the loss of the S-ICD lead .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|(A) Subcutaneous electrocardiogram (S-ECG) of remote monitoring SMARTPASS at pre-dislodgement, QRS positive of extrathoracic lead, and (B) S-ECG of remote monitoring SMARTPASS, QRS negative.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The two-incision technique is a safe and efficacious alternative for S-ICD implantations and offers physicians a less invasive and simplified implantation procedure of the S-ICD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

We used the two-incision technique instead of three incisions for cosmetic reasons as the patient was a juvenile, but for patients that are sports players however, we use the three-incision technique in order to fix the lead more firmly.

We here describe onconeural antigen spreading in a 70-year-old Caucasian male with PND due to SCLC. Onconeural antigen spreading may be promoted by two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms: (i) a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself and (ii) a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens.

Nerve conduction studies revealed severe demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy fulfilling the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Initial MRI of the brain and entire spinal cord showed moderate contrast enhancement in fibers of the cauda equine an radices only (not shown). Cerebral (as part of a whole-body) FDG-PET/CT was normal . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation (cell count of 0/μl; protein 1003 mg/l; albumin ratio 18.4 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ) and presence of elevated fractions of activated HLADR <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD138 <sup>+ </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> plasma cells  without intrathecal Ig-synthesis or oligoclonal bands (type 1 pattern). The detection of serum onconeural anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies together with the long history of smoking  prompted a detailed tumor search especially for SCLC. Chest-CT showed atelectasis of the middle pulmonary lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, whole-body FDG-PET/CT and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy of suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes revealed no malignancy. Sonography of abdomen and pelvis together with detailed urological examination with cystourethroscopy also yielded no evidence for a cancer relapse.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Onconeural antigen spreading in paraneoplastic neurological disease due to small cell lung cancer occurs during continued inflammation.

Neuropsychological assessment showed severe memory impairment and executive dysfunction . Cerebral MRI exhibited increased T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensities without contrast-enhancement, and cerebral FDG-PET/CT demonstrated glucose hypermetabolism of the right more than left temporomesial brain region .

In addition to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1, anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies became detectable in serum and CSF . These findings established paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis in addition to demyelinating and axonal polyradiculoneuropathy and illustrate a spread of the paraneoplastic immune response from the peripheral to the central nervous system. Repeated searches for malignancy using FDG-PET/-CT, chest-CT, abdominal sonography, oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Hence, long-term immunosuppressive treatment was initiated using cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every 4–6 weeks) together with anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (starting with 2 × 500 mg/day).\n\n【8】Clinical and paraclinical follow-up examinations during 22 months of immunosuppressive and anticonvulsive treatment after initial amelioration revealed deteriorating memory and executive functions  together with progressive sensory and also cerebellar ataxia and continued temporal lobe seizures prompting enhanced anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (up to 2 × 1000 mg/day). MRI showed persistent hyperintense T2/FLAIR signals of the right more than left mesial temporal lobe without contrast-enhancement together with progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy . FDG-PET/CT illustrated persistent right temporomesial hypermetabolism . Another FDG-PET/CT scan of the whole body did not provide evidence of cancer.\n\n【9】Remarkably, throughout the disease course antigen spreading of the humoral paraneoplastic immune response could be observed. Anti-Hu, anti-SOX1, and anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies persisted whereas anti-Yo IgG antibodies switched to anti-CV2 IgG antibodies in both serum and CSF . In 01/2016, ~30 months after disease onset and initial detection of onconeural IgG antibodies, SCLC was confirmed from another biopsy of the previously suspicious middle pulmonary lobe, which at that point showed distinct tracer-enrichment upon the fifth FDG-PET/CT scan. Additional staging yielded limited disease, and the patient received combined radio-chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Our case represents a typical PND with associated onconeual antibodies which appears a few years ahead of the related malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Multiple coexisting onconeural antibodies are rare, however such clusters of antibodies occur more frequently than previously assumed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, a dynamic switch between distinct onconeural antibody entities during the course of individual PND has not been reported thus far.\n\n【12】In that regard, two pathophysiological scenarios explaining such antigen spreading seem conceivable: First, (mainly peripheral) antigen spreading may be promoted by a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This would explain the appearance of anti-Zic4 and anti-CV2 IgG antibodies (at higher concentrations in serum compared to CSF) adding to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies which are all frequently associated with PNDs and typical for SCLC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Second, (mainly central) antigen-spreading may be promoted by a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens. This may be enhanced by persistent epileptic activity of the affected brain tissue and (transient) spread of the intrathecal immune response to other sites of the brain and spinal cord i.e. from the limbic system to the cerebellum in this case. This would explain the transient detection of anti-Yo IgG antibodies (at higher concentrations in CSF compared to serum), that are usually not associated with SCLC and mainly expressed by cerebellar Purkinje neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Moreover, a contribution of immunotherapies like cyclophosphamide to the appearance of novel onconeural antibodies during the treatment course due to cytotoxic effects especially on tumor cells (less so on neurons) cannot be excluded.\n\n【14】This illustrates a potential dissociation between peripheral anti-tumoral immunity and central anti-neural immunity during the course of PND which should to be considered for the choice of treatment strategies.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient and his family for participation in this study.

Although most patients with a PFO are asymptomatic, various clinical manifestations may be associated with PFO. The most important is a cryptogenic stroke. Concomitant acute pulmonary embolism (APE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to paradoxical embolism from a PFO are extremely rare. We describe a 77-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension who was transferred due to a sudden onset of dyspnea followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Based on the patient’s medical history, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, coronary angiography, and a whole-body contrasted computed tomography, we diagnosed concomitant APE, AMI and AIS caused by a paradoxical embolism from a PFO. Appropriate knowledge of the pathophysiology of this rare critical illness is important for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A patent foramen ovale (PFO) occurs in ~20–30% of the general population and is a major cause of paradoxical embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A possible mechanism for PFO-related systemic embolic events is a paradoxical embolism, a thrombus from the peripheral venous system that crosses an interatrial defect into the systemic circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is rare to find acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to paradoxical embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and its incidence has been reported as <1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although several AMI cases studies alone or with concomitant AMI and acute pulmonary embolism (APE) with paradoxical embolism due to a PFO have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>, concomitant AMI, APE and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) resulting in cardiac arrest are extremely rare. We describe a case of a patient with paradoxical embolism as concomitant APE, AMI and AIS. The patient’s medical history suggested that APE caused cardiac arrest, and pulmonary hypertension from APE led to a right-to-left shunt due to the PFO, which resulted in AMI and AIS.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension felt severe dyspnea after waking up in the morning and called emergency medical services. When the paramedics arrived, she had collapsed, and an electrocardiogram revealed asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, and she was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital. The return of spontaneous circulation was confirmed 60 minutes after her collapse. Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asynergy of left ventricle lower wall motion, left ventricular retraction due to right ventricle dilation (D-shape); tricuspid regurgitation (TR) flow was 3.1 m/sec, and the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient (TR-PG) was 38.7 mmHg . In addition, regional wall motion abnormality of the basal and mid right ventricular free wall with apical hyper contractility (McConnell’s sign) was observed. Based on these findings, he was suspected to have an AMI complicated by an APE. An emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI was performed. Coronary angiography revealed 100% thrombus occlusion of the distal segment of the right coronary artery (RCA, 4PD) and no obvious stenosis of the other coronary arteries. Balloon dilatation and thrombus aspiration provided complete reperfusion with Grade 3 TIMI blood flow for 4PD occlusion without stenting . A subsequent whole-body computed tomography (CT) was performed to look for thrombosis and determine the cause of the pulmonary embolism. A contrasted chest CT revealed filling defects in the right peripheral pulmonary artery , and bilateral deep vein thrombosis was found in the lower limbs. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for post-resuscitation management. Initially, a right-to-left shunt involved in the mechanism of the concurrent AMI and APE was suspected. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a PFO and blood flow from the right to the left atrium . Despite the absence of sedation and stable hemodynamics, she remained unconscious. The brain CT did not show an abnormality on admission; however, a follow-up brain CT revealed hypodensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres on Day 4 . Based on these findings, we diagnosed APE, AMI and AIS. The suspected mechanism of these multiple embolisms was paradoxical embolism due to a PFO. We administered intravenous heparin for her multiple thrombi. Although there was possibility to be underlying some malignancy and PFO closure was a curative treatment, because of her severe neurological dysfunction caused by the ischemic stroke, no further tests were performed and her family did not consent to PFO closure. She left the intensive care unit on Day 9 and was discharged from the hospital on Day 53 with supportive care taking edoxaban 30 mg daily.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiography shows left ventricular retraction due to right ventricular dilation ( **A** ).

Deep venous thrombus led to APE and caused pulmonary hypertension, which elevated right atrial pressure. The elevated right atrial pressure opened a PFO and caused a right-to-left shunt. The residual thrombus crossed the PFO from the right to the left atrium and entered the arterial circulation, causing an embolic myocardial infarction. Her sudden onset of dyspnea without chest pain and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest with asystole suggested APE than typical AMI. The transthoracic and esophageal echocardiogram and the coronary angiography findings suggested these hypotheses. Subsequent AMI was explained by paradoxical embolism due to a PFO with elevated right atrial pressure. The AIS in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres was suggestive of a watershed infarct and may have been caused by global hypoperfusion, presumably at the time of cardiac arrest due to AMI and APE. It was reasonable to assume that these APE, AMI and AIS had developed in this sequence of events.\n\n【11】Anti-thrombotic therapy such as tissue plasminogen activator should be considered first treatment when patients present with concomitant AMI and APE. However, we could not administer anti-thrombotic drugs because she had a high risk of bleeding related to pulmonary contusion after chest compressions in this case. Therefore, we decided to perform PCI because usage of intravenous heparin for underlying the catheterization can be treated with pulmonary embolism simultaneously. In addition, if the patient’s condition deteriorates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used safely in the catheterization laboratory. The administration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thrombosis and PFO closure is secondary prevention for paradoxical embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although theoretically it may help prevent further recurrence of paradoxical embolism, a PFO may serve to offset the elevated right atrial pressure and maintain cardiac output at the expense of low systemic saturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Little evidence exists to guide the decision to close a PFO in such a situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Prompt clinical diagnosis and targeted therapies adapted for the specific clinical presentation may have averted a fatal outcome.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Kiyoshi Takemoto.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:36:11", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:36:19", "cost": 7.655}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:36:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:36:11"}

Some FBs can induce the perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, including fish bones, chicken bones and toothpicks. The ingestion of FBs is rarely associated with bowel perforation, and most FBs are passed spontaneously. The ingestion of sharp and pointed objects typically produces adverse events related to the upper gastrointestinal system, and FBs are rarely retained in the colon. Bowel perforation caused by the ingestion of FBs should be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Here, we present the unusual case of a 51-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with complaints of acute abdominal pain secondary to fish bone ingestion, which triggered cecum perforation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The ingestion of foreign bodies (FBs) is a common occurrence in emergency practice among both children and adults. Most FBs pass through the digestive tract, with < 1% of FBs associated with complications, particularly gastrointestinal perforations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. FB perforations often occur at points of acute angulation and narrowing bowel loops, such as the duodenal loop, duodenojejunal junction, ileocecal valve, appendix and sigma colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Fish bones are very commonly ingested FBs in areas where fish is a common diet component. The clinical symptoms of intestinal perforation are nonspecific. Intestinal perforation can be also misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis or acute diverticulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. FB ingestion may lead to severe complications such as bleeding, perforation, and these complications are well-correlated with the size, shape and location of the FB within the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with complications due to FBs can typically be managed through observation, surgical intervention or endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this article, we describe a case of fish bone ingestion that resulted in cecum perforation.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old male presented with sudden-onset, right lower quadrant pain, with gradual exacerbation over 1 day. The patient complained of mild nausea, loose stools without hematochezia and a slightly elevated body temperature (38.5°C). No abnormalities were noted in the patient’s medical history. On abdominal examination, the clinician noticed right lower abdominal tenderness and muscle tension, with normal bowel sounds. The laboratory results were as follows: increased white blood cell count (15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and increased neutrophils (12 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l). Because the symptoms and physical examination were suspicious for appendicitis, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The CT findings revealed a high-density FB inside the cecum . The mural of the cecum was thickened, with fat stranding. Foci of gas in the peritoneal cavity adjacent to the object was also observed , suggested that the FB had caused cecum perforation. The FB was sharp-pointed, with a density of 900 HU . The patient received an emergency operation, and a punctate perforation area was detected on the cecum. The patient was managed successfully with a cecectomy and the removal of the FB, which was confirmed to be a fish bone (30 mm in length) . The patient received antibiotic therapy and had no complications during the postoperative period. Upon further investigation, the patient reported eating fish 2 days before symptom onset, which supported the operative findings. The patient was discharged 3 days after surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT scanner showed a high-density FB intra-cecum ( **A** , arrow), with fat stranding around the cecum.

Laparoscopic cecectomy confirmed a fish bone, measuring ~30 mm, resulting in cecum perforation ( **B** ).</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Gastrointestinal FBs are often introduced by ingestion, especially among children and older individuals. Patients with dentures, alcoholics and psychiatric patients are at high risk of FB ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The terminal ileum, ileocecal, the rectosigmoidal region and the cecum are common sites of FB retention in gastrointestinal tract due to the anatomical features at these locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Complications are often caused by sharp objects such as fish bones or toothpicks, resulting in a high risk of local injuries, including mucosal laceration and perforation. The clinical presentations can vary, and patients present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, peritonitis, abscess, fistula, intestinal obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding, associated with acute abdominal pain. Thus, FB-associated perforations can mimic other emergency conditions, including diverticulitis, appendicitis and gastric ulcer perforations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, patients generally do not remember swallowing the FBs, which can result in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Some FBs can become trapped, causing dangerous complications, such as the development of an abscess, an enteric fistula, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis and blood vessel complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Some case reports have reported the migration of ingested FBs to the liver, urinary bladder or iliac artery, resulting in the formation of an arterio-enteric fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>. Plain radiographic studies can be used to investigate metallic objects and pneumo-peritoneum or bowel obstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although fish bones are radiopaque and generally visible on plain radiography; however, some of them that are low radiopaque and small dimensions, are invisible on plain film. The ultrasound has typically been used to diagnose non-radiopaque FBs, revealing intra-abdominal fluids, which can be useful for excluding other differential diagnoses. CT scans are also helpful for recognizing intestinal FBs and represents the best imaging modality for identifying radiopaque FBs. CT scans can also define the exact location of ingested objects and identify the development of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Important signs of perforation on CT scans include fat stranding and thickening of affected bowel segment walls. Air bubbles can often be observed surrounding the perforation site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. FB management depends on the location within the digestive tract and the occurrence of other complications, such as perforation, hemorrhage, bleeding, and the involvement of other affected organs. When objects are small and do not injure the gastrointestinal tract, they can be observed and followed-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Endoscopy is also an effective method, especially for FBs in the upper gastrointestinal tract or during early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Surgical interventions are necessary in complicated cases, even when the FB is located in the upper gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】In this case report, the patient suffered from acute, right lower quadrant abdominal pain and low-grade fever, which could be misdiagnosed as appendicitis, and his medical history was easily dismissed. Fortunately, the fish bone and bowel perforation were easy to detect on CT images. Surgery, in this case, was necessary due to the bowel perforation complication and the site of the fish bone, which was difficult to treat with endoscopy.\n\n【11】FBs typically present with non-specific symptoms that may mimic other acute abdominal pain-inducing complications. Intestinal perforations by fish bones are unusual, especially in the lower segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical and radiological diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforations remains non-specific and challenging. This case indicated the important role played by CT scans for the determination of diagnosis and the identification of potential complications. The primary treatment is surgical intervention for the removal of foreign objects, although endoscopy can be useful when foreign objects are located in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Our institution does not require ethical approval for reporting individual cases or case series.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written consent for publication has been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Hanoi Medical University, Vietnam.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT: computed tomography</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FB: foreign body</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:54", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:59:23", "cost": 28.714}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:59:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:54"}

We describe a 73-year-old woman who presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and melena. A computed tomography scan revealed a hypodense lesion, measuring 6 × 6 × 5 cm, along the upper part of the stomach. An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion, measuring 8 × 6 cm, between the cardia and body of the stomach. Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion, consistent with a lipoma, in the body of the stomach. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy.

Most angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract have been reported in the liver, and only a few cases of gastric angiolipomas (GA) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. A gastric angiolipoma almost exclusively occurs as a solitary lesion, and patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms. Some patients may be asymptomatic, whereas others may have signs and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. We report a case of gastric angiolipoma in a patient who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools. The patient denied any history of hematemesis, per rectal bleeding, fever or weight loss. She also denied any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, heart burn or reflux disease. Her family history was non-contributive. A review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【6】On examination, she was conscious, oriented, alert and did not show signs of respiratory distress. She looked pale but her vital signs were stable. Cardiovascular and chest examinations were unremarkable. Her abdomen was mildly distended and soft on palpation. It was not tender to palpation and bowel sounds were normal. Her initial workup revealed anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 6.4 g/dl. An abdominal X-ray reveled a normal distribution of bowel gas.\n\n【7】The patient was initially resuscitated successfully. She received 2 l of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells, which resulted in an improvement of her hemoglobin level to 7.5 g/dl. She was also started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy before performing further investigations.\n\n【8】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, chest and pelvis revealed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper part of the stomach . The lesion showed mostly fatty density and multiple lymph node enlargements surrounding the stomach and gastrohepatic ligament, with the largest one measuring 1 cm. The chest and pelvis were unremarkable.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A CT scan of the abdomen showed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper stomach.</u>\n\n【10】An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion measuring 8 × 6 cm between the cardia and body of the stomach . Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with circumscribed margins in the body of the stomach, consistent with a lipoma. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. Endoscopic resection was not suitable in this case lesion too large, that's why laparoscopic resection was chosen here.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Upper endoscopy images showing a large polypoid mass.</u>\n\n【12】A laparoscopy identified a mass in the midsection of the greater curvature of the stomach. LigaSure™ was used to release the omentum from the greater curvature. Next a wedge resection was done by using Endo GIA size 60 (purple). A gross evaluation revealed a homogeneous, yellow-tan colored, fatty mass measuring 6 × 5 × 4 cm, with no area of hemorrhage or necrosis. A histopathological examination revealed a well-demarcated encapsulated lipomatous tumor arising in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Histopathological section of the specimen (hematoxylin and eosin staining) showing varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels ( **A** ).

Her symptoms completely resolved, and her hemoglobin level was stable at 12 g/dl.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are a rare entity composed of mature fat cells and proliferating cells that are usually found in the gastric antrum. The symptoms associated with GA are nonspecific and may range from dyspepsia, vague abdominal discomfort, pain, cramping, bloating and gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. Anemia is also common in these patients and is usually the result of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The patient in our case presented with fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools, which is characteristic in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although our patient presented with a 3-day history of melena and had severe anemia requiring resuscitation, she may have had occult blood in her stool that went undetected until the tumor caused mucosal ulceration and massive bleeding.\n\n【17】On ultrasonography, an angiolipoma appears as a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous, hyperechoic mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The findings on an abdominal CT are usually variable, with the tumor generally appearing as a heterogenous mass with mixed soft tissue density and fat. The lesion in this patient’s case appeared as a solitary, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with smooth borders on a linear endoscopic ultrasound. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hypodense lesion that showed mostly fatty density. Generally, the density of an angiolipoma can vary on CT based on the proportion of the tumor’s components, making it challenging to reach a diagnosis pre-operatively. Thus, the diagnosis is usually made intraoperatively and confirmed following a histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】On gross examination, an angiolipoma is a well-defined, encapsulated mass and its cut surface has a yellowish to reddish appearance based on its fat or vascular component. The tumor is composed of mature adipose cells interspersed with proliferating blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In some cases, fibrin thrombi are observed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections is central to determining the varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels in the tumor. However, immunohistochemical examination is rarely required.\n\n【19】The treatment of angiolipoma depends on the tumor size. In patients with small pedunculated polyps, an endoscopic resection can be offered. However, the diagnosis is usually discovered late when patients already present with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction, making it challenging to perform an endoscopic resection. Given the increased risk of hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation, endoscopic resection may not be recommended for large tumors or those with wide implantation bases.

However, fluids continued to accumulate in the tracheal tube, requiring frequent suctioning with a periodic bronchoscope. On the 14th day in the ICU, chest contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the left upper and lower lobes and persistent congestion in the left upper lobe, which was the probable cause of the sanguineous sputum . Exploratory thoracotomy was performed, revealing an ~90° counter clockwise torsion of the left upper lobe (viewed facing the descending aorta from the right lung field) that resulted in lung discoloration. A possible cause for this torsion was attributed to the omental graft, which reduced the thoracic cavity space. Prompt detorsion was performed to improve lung coloration.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography images of the chest.

Severe dermatological adverse events are rare with these agents; however, they require direct recognition and management in order not to become life-threatening. Erythema multiforme (EM) belongs to a dermatopathic spectrum that includes immune-mediated, widespread hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs with varying degrees of severity and affects the skin and/or the mucosa. We hereby present a case of ribociclib- and palbociclib-related EM. We sought to report this case given the implication of two agents from the same drug class in EM onset. We also aim to emphasize the breadth of mechanisms of actions of CKIs, with an impingement in the immune system as well, and the importance of promptly identifying and handling such skin toxicities.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Erythema multiforme (EM) comprises an acute, immune-mediated, self-limited and sometimes recurring condition, which is considered a type IV hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections, medications and other various triggers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It affects the skin and/or mucous membranes, depending on its extent (minor or major), and its classic lesion is called ‘target or iris lesion’. Its lesions are typically initiated from the extremities with a predilection for the extensor surfaces, and they spread centripetally, even though patients’ trunk is usually less affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 interacting with cyclin D pose an essential role in cell division and proliferation, inducing the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Thus, CDK4/6 inhibitors (CKIs) block cell cycle progression. CKIs, including palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, are amongst the newest targeted therapies approved for locally advanced or metastatic ﻿hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer (BC). Their most common adverse events (AEs) are haematologic and gastrointestinal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cutaneous toxicities have been reported to an ~15% of total AEs with CKIs and are mostly grade 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We hereby describe the case of a female patient who developed grade 2 EM while treated with ribociclib and later on with palbociclib.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 50-year-old premenopausal female was diagnosed with HR-positive and HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. She underwent a right mastectomy and axillary lymph node (LN) dissection, where 2 out of the 10 removed LNs were infiltrated. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy followed for 5 years, with tamoxifen and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue.\n\n【7】Fourteen years later, the patient complained about swelling in her right arm. On physical examination, swelling and palpable masses in the field of the preceded mastectomy and axilla, with infiltration of the overlying axillary skin, were found. The following imaging showed an 18-mm lesion on the right pectoralis major and the conterminous axilla, without pathological axillary LNs. The core biopsy from the lesion of the right axillary region confirmed the recrudescence of BC. The requested chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed multiple lung nodules (<1 cm). The patient was commenced on letrozole and ribociclib.\n\n【8】Almost 6 weeks later, she complained about a skin rash with a burning and itching sensation in both her upper extremities. On physical examination, erythematous, pink-to-violaceous, tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae were observed on her hands bilaterally . According to the patient, the lesions erupted 1 month after the initiation of the therapy and got worse over the last 2 weeks. The oral cavity was unaffected.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|First eruption of EM-like skin lesions in palms, after treatment with letrozole and ribociclib.</u>\n\n【10】Regarding her medical history, she suffered from Hashimoto thyroiditis and arterial hypertension. No use of new medications or other substances was reported.\n\n【11】The lesions had the typical appearance of EM. However, at this first evaluation, skin biopsies were not obtained. Given the suspicion of ribociclib-mediated skin toxicity, the permanent discontinuation of ribociclib was decided. The patient continued receiving letrozole, and the rash gradually abated. A month later, the CKI palbociclib was added to the treatment.\n\n【12】After the first cycle of palbociclib, the patient presented grade 3 neutropenia and recurrence of the skin rash. Again, she had tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae with the ‘bull’s eye’ appearance. A complete physical examination revealed an aphthous lesion in the hard palate. The skin punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion on the fourth finger due to its typical ‘bull’s eye’ appearance, adequate size and easy access. It showed epidermal and subepidermal vesiculation, apoptotic keratinocytes in all levels of the epidermis and moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltration associated with lymphocytic exocytosis and satellite cell necrosis as well as extravasation of red blood cells in the upper dermis . Melanin incontinence or neutrophils were not found in the infiltrate. These features confirmed the drug-mediated lichenoid skin reaction with characteristics of EM. The definite discontinuation of the CKIs was decided, and the patient was continued on letrozole. All lesions subsided within the next month. She remains in remission from BC (progression-free survival of 2 years) and without EM recurrence.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) skin punch biopsy form the hand showing lichenoid infiltrate rich in lymphocytes in the upper dermis, epidermal and focal sub-epidermal vesiculation.

Infections constitute the trigger in ~90% of cases, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) being the most common precipitator factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In contrast to viral-associated EM, where the effector cytokine is interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, cases of drug-induced EM are associated with tumour necrosis factor-a, perforin and granzyme B, which cause the epidermal destruction seen in the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In cases of drug-induced EM, lesions appear within 72 hours of drug exposure but occasionally erupt over 1–2 weeks. Duration from onset to healing, typically without complications, is <4 weeks, usually about 2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of EM is predominantly clinical, based on the patient’s history and physical examination. When the clinical picture is clear, a biopsy is not required because its findings are not specific to EM. In atypical presentation or recurrent EM without documented HSV infection, histopathological features may pose the main role in the differential diagnosis of EM from other entities that mimic its onset, such as urticaria, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> The treatment of EM depends on the underlying aetiology and the disease severity. The main aim is to remove the impelling factor. In the case of a drug-induced EM, this entails the discontinuation of the responsible medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The mechanism of action of CKIs is manifold. Apart from obstructing cell cycle proliferation, they are capable of upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I and enhancing antigen presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Moreover, they increase proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, programmed death-ligand 1 expression and infiltration of the effector T cells in the tumour microenvironment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Last but not least, CKIs selectively deplete the T-regulatory population by suppressing their proliferation, decreasing their effect in subduing immune response simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】CKIs are generally considered safe, with manageable side effects. The most frequently reported amongst them include haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, especially neutropenia with palbociclib and ribociclib and diarrhoea with abemaciclib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Skin reactions are also included in the spectrum of their AEs, yet they are usually considered mild and do not warrant a definite cessation of them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, more severe skin toxicities, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Herein, we have presented a case of CKI-induced EM. In our case, EM erupted later than typically reported after drug exposure and occurred while on treatment both with ribociclib and palbociclib; thus, EM constituted a drug class-observed AE. We would like to emphasize that a multidisciplinary approach to oncological patients, as well as early recognition and sufficient management of skin toxicities, are mandatory in order to prevent lethal conditions and improve the quality of life of this population.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>E.V.

A cystic mediastinal teratoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion.\n\n【2】cardiac tamponade\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Mediastinal teratoma is one of the most common mediastinal tumors with an incidence of 8–13% of all mediastinal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most cases of mediastinal teratoma are incidentally detected by routine imaging study. But they can also cause symptoms such as chest discomfort, dyspnea or palpitations. Mediastinal teratoma could also compress on the adjacent structures and rarely cause a life-threatening complication such as cardiac tamponade due to rupture of cystic teratoma into the pericardial sac. We present two cases of patients with ruptured teratoma leading to cardiac tamponade, which was treated by surgical intervention.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】### Case 1\n\n【7】A 34-year-old male was transferred to our emergency department with dyspnea, chest pain and cough of 1-week duration. He presented 1-day previously and was found to have a cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum that measured 11 × 8 cm with pericardial effusion on chest computed tomography (CT) scan but he was hemodynamically stable with no evidence of cardiac tamponade at that time. His symptoms were aggravated until he was transferred to our hospital. His heart rate was 114 beats per minute (bpm) with blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg. His respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute and he complained of aggravated dyspnea. The jugular vein was not engorged and lung sound was decreased. Laboratory studies were all within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed large amount of pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusion. Chest CT revealed a markedly increased pericardial effusion . This finding could suggest cardiac tamponade due to rupture of cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade with large pericardial effusion and dilated inferior vena cava. The emergent pericardiocentesis was done and ~800 cc of dark brown colored pericardial effusion was drained. Analysis of the fluid revealed a pH of 7.50, a WBC count of 1360/mm <sup>3 </sup> (predominantly neutrophils), a protein level of 3.8 g/dl, an LDH level of 983 U/L and a glucose level of 87 mg/dl. The fluid was negative for bacterial culture, acid-fast bacilli smear, culture and tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction. The cytology of the fluid was negative for malignancy. The patient subsequently underwent anterior mediastinal mass excision via median sternotomy. Intraoperatively, the cystic mass has a severe adhesion with the pericardium and mediastinal pleura. The pericardium was remarkably thickened and the mass was filled with large amount of yellowish materials and hair components. A small hole was found on the pericardium adjacent to the tumor, indicating a rupture of the mass into the pericardial space. En bloc resection of the mass including the adjacent pericardium and mediastinal pleura was done. The resected mass was sent for pathologic examination, which was diagnosed as mature cystic teratoma. The specimen showed multiloculated cyst containing sebum-like materials and matted hairs. The patient had an uneventful clinical course and was discharged without further complication.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest X-ray ( **A** ) showed enlarged mediastinal shadow and chest CT scan ( **B** ) revealed large cystic mass (black arrow) with large amount of pericardial effusion.</u>\n\n【9】### Case 2\n\n【10】A 49-year-old male presented to our emergency department with acute dyspnea and chest pain that occurred 1-h ago. On physical examination, his heart rate was 108 bpm, with respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg. The jugular vein was not distended and lung sound was decreased on the left side. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening with left pleural effusion. Chest CT revealed a cystic mass that measured 8 × 5 cm with pericardial effusion in the anterior mediastinum . Laboratory studies were all within normal limits except the white blood count, which was 11 000 per microliter of blood. Chest X-ray showed large amount of pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusion. This finding could lead to cardiac tamponade due to rupture of cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade physiology with multiloculated pericardial effusion. The patient underwent the three-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery from the left side. Intraoperatively, the mass has a severe adhesion with the thickened pericardium and mediastinal pleura. The left phrenic nerve was encapsulated with the mass, which was filled with large amount of yellowish materials and calcification. The communication between pericardium and mass could not be found. En bloc resection of the mass including the adjacent pericardium, mediastinal pleura and left phrenic nerve was done. The resected mass was diagnosed as mature cystic teratoma. He was discharged on postoperative Day 7 without complication.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Heterogenous multichambered cytic mas with periperal enhancement (black arrow).</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Teratomas comprise ~8–13% of all mediastinal tumors and mature cystic teratomas are composed of well-differentiated derivations from at least 2 of the 3 germ cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm). Benign cystic teratomas of the anterior mediastinum are rarely complicated by rupture into an adjacent body cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A cystic mediastinal teratoma rupture into the pericardial space occurs in association with <1% of all benign teratomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The mechanism of rupture remains controversial. Sommerlad _et al._ suggested that the secretion of digestive enzymes such as amylase from the tumor might cause fistula formation into the adjacent structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although most cases of mediastinal teratoma are incidentally found on chest X-ray, chest CT scan is considered as the diagnostic modality of choice for confirming the nature of tumor and its relationship to the adjacent structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cardiac tamponade is the accumulation of pericardial fluid within the pericardial space that creates an increase in intrapericardial pressure, restricting cardiac filling and decreasing cardiac output. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and clinical signs include tachycardia, hypotension, distant heart sounds, elevated jugular venous pressure and a pulsus paradoxus > 10 mmHg. With regard to management, surgical resection of the benign mediastinal teratoma is recommended by many authors since the cystic mediastinal teratoma could be the cause of potential life-threatening cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The prognosis and 5-year survival rates are excellent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our two cases, the tumor was radically resected with no complication and the patients were discharged in a good condition.\n\n【14】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【15】Although there are a limited number of cases of cardiac tamponade secondary to the rupture of cystic mediastinal teratoma, cystic teratoma rupture should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion, which could lead to the life-threatening cardiac tamponade.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Appropriate written informed consent was obtained for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The corresponding author will be the guarantor for this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:44:57", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:50:57", "cost": 360.043}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:50:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:44:57"}

The observed incidence of metastasis was 0.67% ( _n_ \\= 8). Incidence increased to 2% of WHO grade II and 8.6% of grade III meningiomas. Among these patients, no case of extracranial meningioma with bone metastasis has been reported.\n\n【14】We have reported rare case of malignant extracranial meningioma with multiple bone metastasis. By needle biopsy, we confirmed histopathological diagnosis as metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, WHO grade III. Moreover, pathology of the surgical specimen showed some vascular invasions in Fig. 4 , suggesting malignant behavior. In conclusion, our experience with the present case in primary pulmonary meningioma has shown that we should think about extracranial meningioma as differential diagnosis in case of the patient with bone metastasis. The patients with extracranial meningioma should therefore be carefully monitored.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest statement\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u></u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u></u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u></u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication and gave their consent.

CT depicted the presence of blood contrast level in IVC in all cases with reflux of contrast into hepatic veins and liver parenchyma.\n\n【16】The physiological basis of IVC layering or pooling has been described previously. In normal physiological state specific gravity has no effect on contrast agent dynamics. However, in cases of cardiac failure there is decreased arterial and venous blood flow due to failure of forward flow of blood. Contrast agents are heavier than blood and hence accumulate in dependent parts of venous system leading to dependent venous pooling. It depends on density, specific gravity and injected volume of the contrast agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】This condition has been described previously after cardiogenic shock, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

She had history of fever and sore throat a week before for which she was treated with oral co-amoxiclav and paracetamol at the local health facility. Dysphagia was present both for solid and liquids. There was no history of use of any steroids or immunocompromising drugs. She had no history of smoking or alcohol use. Also, there was no personal or family history of antecedent HSV exposure. On examination, her vitals were normal. Her general and systemic examination findings were within normal limits. Her oral examination revealed no ulcer or blisters. During the initial evaluation of fever, her investigations for etiologies of fever including Malaria, Dengue, Typhoid, Leptospira, Scrub typhus were unremarkable. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was done which was negative.

Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy was done which revealed multiple ulcers with hemorrhages especially in the middle and distal third of esophagus . The gastroesophageal junction, stomach and duodenum were normal. Multiple biopsies were taken from the ulcerated area for histopathology. Her histopathology report revealed viable squamous epithelium cells around ulcerative margin showing eosinophilic round intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A inclusion bodies) separated by clear zone from thickened nuclear membrane features. There was no evidence of atypia or malignancy . These findings were suggestive of HSE. Serology done for HSV I/II IgG level was 6.30 AU/ml (reference range: < 2 AU/ml) i.e. raised above normal range. With these, the diagnosis of HSE was made and she was started on intravenous acyclovir for initial 5 days. Later acyclovir was continued orally for total 10 days. Upper GI endoscopy was repeated after 7 days showed marked improvement in the ulcers with most of them already healing. She was discharged on oral acyclovir and sucralfate suspension. At the time of discharge, she could take orally well and her symptoms of dysphagia and odynophagia have almost disappeared. On follow-up after two weeks she was free from all symptoms and tolerating orally.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】HSV is a DNA virus which can cause wide range of disease from inapparent to fatal illness. The site of involvement, immune status of host and whether the disease is primary or recurrent are the determinant of severity of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common visceral organ infected by HSV is esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. HSE usually results from reactivation of HSV and spread of virus to esophageal mucosa via vagus nerve or direct extension of oropharyngeal infection into esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A study conducted by Canalejo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> showed 44% patient had primary infection on the basis of serology.\n\n【11】HSE commonly occurs in persons with clinical evidence of immunosuppression but several cases of HSE in immunocompetent host have been described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. The common presentation in HSE is odynophagia, dysphagia and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Reported cases of HSE were diagnosed by various methods such as endoscopy, blood test of IgM and IgG for HSV I/II, viral tissue culture and viral DNA PCR. The gold standard for diagnosing the infection is obtaining biopsy from esophageal mucosa with microscopic evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Acyclovir 400 mg orally five times a day for 14 to 21 days is standard treatment for immunocompromised host in HSE. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs in immunocompetent hosts after 1–2 weeks even without treatment. However, the patient may respond quickly if treated with a short course of oral acyclovir.\n\n【12】In this case, the patient was immunocompetent without any history of immunosuppressive drugs. There was neither history of previous herpetic infection nor evidence of herpes labialis or oropharyngeal ulcer on examination. The diagnosis was based on endoscopic finding and histopathological examination of sample obtained from lesion in esophageal mucosa during endoscopy. The typical findings of upper GI endoscopy are multiple mucosal ulcers which are well circumscribed and have a ‘volcano-like’ appearance. Yield is better if biopsies or brushing are taken from the edge of an ulcer where viral cytopathic effects are most likely to be present. In our patient, the lesions of esophagus were not typical as described however the histopathology and serology for HSV supported the diagnosis. Viral culture, and DNA PCR for HSV could not be performed because of nonavailability. There was quick response to the treatment with acyclovir.\n\n【13】HSE should be suspected in a healthy patient with acute onset of dysphagia or odynophagia with typical ulcerations in the upper Gi endoscopy. Endoscopy should be performed in these patients with symptoms of esophagitis and biopsy should be taken to confirm the diagnosis. With the confirmation of HSE careful history taking should be obtained to rule out any immune disorder such as HIV. Although HSE in immunocompetent host is self-limiting use of acyclovir may hasten the recovery.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed for this case report.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.

It is caused by a limited number of pathologies but can, in rare situations, be idiopathic. Its management is difficult and usually involves correcting the primary pathology, making idiopathic chylous ascites particularly difficult to manage. We present a case of idiopathic chylous ascites extensively investigated over a period of several years. An incidental finding of B cell lymphoma was initially suspected to have been the primary cause of the ascites; however, after successful treatment of this condition, the patient’s ascites did not resolve. Diagnostic difficulties and management are discussed and an overview of the diagnostic process is outlined through this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Chylous ascites is an uncommon finding in patients with abdominal distension. Incidence is 1 in 20 000 hospital admissions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is associated with malignancy, infections, cirrhosis, trauma or previous abdominal surgery. We present a case of idiopathic chylous ascites in a patient where all known causes of underlying pathology were excluded.\n\n【4】SUMMARY\n-------\n\n【5】A 72- year-old man was referred to the gastroenterology clinic due to abdominal distension, weight loss and change in bowel habit. He had no significant past medical history, previous trauma, risk factors for liver disease or abdominal surgery.\n\n【6】A computed tomogram (CT) chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed demonstrating a right-sided pleural effusion and large volume ascites . The liver, other abdominal viscera and lymph nodes appeared normal except for small simple liver and splenic cysts.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography demonstrating (a) large right-sided pleural effusion with surrounding atelectasis and (b) significant abdominal ascites with benign liver and splenic cysts.</u>\n\n【8】Both the pleural effusion and ascites were sampled—the aspirate appeared light pink and milky in color consistent with chyle. Analysis of the fluid revealed the presence of chylomicrons and raised levels of triglycerides (13.6 mmol/L) in keeping with chylous ascites. Fluid and serum LDH were normal and the serum-ascitic albumin gradient (SAAG) was 9 g/L, suggestive of an exudative process or malignancy rather than portal hypertension or heart failure. Fluid cytology revealed a small clonal B cell population (13% of total white cells; CD5-/CD10-/CD20+/CD23+) together with reactive T-cells, suggestive of possible low grade B-cell lymphoma. Myd88 mutation analysis was indeterminate. As part of work-up for lymphoma, bone marrow trephine biopsy and aspiration was performed and did not reveal evidence of malignancy. However, repeat sampling of the ascitic fluid returned clonal B-cells with identical phenotype. The working diagnosis was low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the patient was given first-line (Rituximab single agent) and then second-line (Bendamustine and Rituximab) treatment. Neither treatment resulted in the improvement of ascites, despite disappearance of the clonal B cells from the ascitic fluid. PET scans showed no evidence of FDG-avid disease on three separate occasions, with no radiological thickening of the pleura or peritoneum suggestive of non-FDG avid lymphomatous deposits.\n\n【9】Echocardiogram did not show evidence of heart failure, valvular pathology or constrictive pericarditis and blood tests were negative for autoimmune liver diseases, hepatitis B and C, HIV and TB. Transjugular liver biopsy failed due to inadvertent brachiocephalic artery puncture, so transgastric endoscopic ultrasound left lobe liver biopsy was performed and revealed normal hepatic tissue with no evidence of cirrhosis or inflammation. Lymphangiography was not performed but there was no history of prior thoracic trauma or external beam radiotherapy.\n\n【10】The patient was started on a low triglyceride diet by dietitians and continued to have regular paracentesis for symptomatic relief. In 2022, he was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (ascitic WCC 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). There was no perforation on plain radiography or CT imaging. Despite brief improvement with broad spectrum antibiotics, repeat ascitic fluid cultures returned multi-resistant _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus faecium_ . Despite high leukocytosis and mixed bacterial ascitic culture, repeat CT imaging demonstrated no viscus perforation or abscess, and the patient was started on nasogastric feeding and therapeutic paracentesis when symptomatic from tense ascites.\n\n【11】Despite regular paracentesis, there was rapid re-accumulation of ascites and further deterioration with splinting of the diaphragm and respiratory compromise. After further clinical deterioration, repeat CT scanning of the abdomen was performed which demonstrated pneumoperitoneum and a possible perforation and the hepatic flexure of the colon. Further ascitic cultures grew _Candida albicans_ and _E. faecium_ . The patient died as a result of acute peritonitis despite conservative medical management as he was not fit for surgical intervention. A post-mortem was not undertaken after the case was reviewed by the medical examiner as the cause of death was peritonitis secondary to bowel perforation.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Chylous ascites is rare and usually has a poor outcome due to its frequent association with malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Other contributing factors to morbidity are the loss of a large volume of fluid, calorie-rich lipids and protein in the ascitic fluid. The mainstay of treatment is management of the underlying cause, but as this case shows, this is not always possible when the underlying cause is not identified.\n\n【14】In such situations, symptomatic management is required. Changes in oral diet ensure reduction in lymph flow—low lipid and high medium chain triglyceride diets are the first step, but total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be started if adapted diets fail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed and transported to the liver as free fatty acids and glycerol, while long-chain triglycerides are converted to chylomicrons, thereby increasing lymph production. TPN may be used in selected cases when enteral diet has failed to improve ascites, as reduction in enteral feeding can result in reduction of lymph flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Both somatostatin and its analogues use have been reported in literature. The mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to reduce portal pressure and decrease peristalsis, leading to a reduced absorption of triglycerides into the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. This treatment was not used in our case.\n\n【16】Repeated therapeutic paracentesis or indwelling shunts (e.g. peritoneal-venous ‘Denver’ shunts) may be performed for symptomatic relief, but this comes with the added risk of infection or shunt occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. No previous studies have identified or postulated whether chylous ascites increases the risk of secondary bacterial peritonitis, or whether this is more likely a secondary complication of repeated ascitic drainage, but chronic loss of chyle does result in immune system compromise and malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is therefore crucial to involve dietitians as part of a multidisciplinary approach to management to ensure adequate calorie intake.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received or required in this case.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no ethical approval required in this case.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary materials.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Suresh V.

On review of initial LHC, concerns were raised about the proximal extension of the dissection into the left main coronary artery (LMCA). This prompted a recommendation for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which revealed evidence of SCAD in LMCA extending into the distal LMCA and proximal OM branch with aneurysm formation at distal LMCA and Left circumflex artery (LCX) . Repeat LHC revealed aneurysms in distal LMCA and mid-left circumflex artery, with 50% narrowing of the lumen in between two aneurysms, as well as a focal dissection in the medial branch of LCX . The previously placed stent was patent. With LMCA involvement, decision was made to proceed with a three-vessel CABG. At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, the patient is doing well and remains pain-free.

We describe a 55-year-old male with no history of coronary disease, who presented with worsening substernal chest pain with exertion, and was ruled out for myocardial infarction. On left heart catheterization and subsequent computed tomography angiogram, he was determined to have a dual LAD with a long LAD emerging from the right coronary artery. Moreover, this long LAD gave collaterals to a native long diagonal that ran parallel to this vessel from the left system and was chronically occluded. The long LAD, consistent with type IV classification, traveled in the anterior intraventricular groove to supply left ventricular myocardium; the chronically occluded long left native diagonal supplying lateral walls and apex is a unique variant. It is important to be aware of these anomalies to establish correct diagnoses and determine treatment options.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Anomalies in coronary artery anatomy can be incidentally discovered during cardiac catheterization performed for other indications. Alternative high-resolution modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) angiogram or magnetic resonance angiography (sensitivity 88%, specificity 100%), can further help to delineate the course of the vessels. A rare variation described herein is an anomalous left anterior descending artery (LAD); this vessel emerges from the right coronary artery but courses between the thoracic aorta and pulmonary outflow tract while finally transcending into the anterior intraventricular sulcus (AIVS). Spindola-Franco _et al_ originally described dual LAD physiology by defining it as an early bifurcation of the LAD into two vessels or a second LAD that emerges from the right coronary artery. One vessel remains in the AIVS and does not extend to the apex and the other continues distally in the AIVS towards the apex. Although this variation is not immediately pathologic, it complicates management decisions for revascularization when disease is found.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nicotine dependence presented with worsening substernal chest pain with exertion. Initial work up showed a non-contributory electrocardiogram and troponin levels within normal limits. Patient already had a recent stress test myocardial perfusion imaging scan performed at outside hospital that was negative for ischemia or scar or high-risk features. The patient’s persistent atypical pain and risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) soon resulted in cardiac catheterization for possible acute coronary syndrome. Left heart catheterization via the right radial artery showed a large left main coronary artery that bifurcates into left circumflex artery with minimal disease and short LAD that gave a small diagonal artery which was occluded proximally . Upon engaging the right sinus of valsalva, an anomalous course was discovered. The right coronary artery was small and nondominant. The long LAD emerging from the right coronary artery gave collaterals to the previously mentioned long diagonal system on the left . Ventriculogram showed normal ejection fraction with normal intracardiac and transvalvular pressures.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Catheter engagement of the left sinus of valsalva demonstrating angiographically significant vessels left main, large left circumflex with medium size OM and lPL branches. Native LAD is occluded at proximal segment 100% and gives one diagonal prior to occlusion.

It was confirmed that the right coronary artery traveled in the anterior intraventricular groove to supply left ventricular myocardium, consistent with a type IV dual LAD per Spindola-Franco classification . Moreover, the normal MPI was reassuring that there was not compression involved; since that was the case, intravascular ultrasound was not performed in order to further assess this point. Cardiovascular surgery was not pursued since anomalous long LAD supply of anterior and septal regions was adequate without disease. The chronically occluded native long diagonal had adequate collateralization from the right long anomalous LAD at the apex. This was effectively single vessel disease with chronic total occlusion and negative low risk stress test on intermediate medical therapy. By appropriate use criteria for revascularization, it was determined the best option would be for further optimal medical therapy. The patient was discharged on optimal medical management including multiple antianginals: isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg, ranolazine 500 mg po bid, atenolol 25 mg po daily. High-risk percutaneous intervention of the ostial D1 would be pursued if symptoms could not be properly controlled.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Right sinus of valslava with RCA and conus branches.

A lot can go awry in this complex process resulting in a range of variations from subclinical to sudden cardiac death. Prevalence of anomalies has been described from 0.64 to 1.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, with 81% considered benign according to a 28-year study at the Cleveland Clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A dual LAD is significantly less frequent with prevalence ranging from 0.01 to 0.03% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Spindola-Franco _et al_ classified dual LAD into 4 original different types though up to 10 have since been described (Source 9): . This unique variant with long diagonal reaching the apex on the left system has not been described to the best of our knowledge.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Normal type—Normal line diagram demonstrating normal coronary anatomy distribution. Normal LAD originates from the left main bifurcation and travels in the anterior interventricular groove giving rise to septal and diagonal branches.

Long LAD after proximal course runs along left side of the interventricular territory into the distal interventricular groove. Type II—Short and long LAD originate from common LAD trunk. Short LAD courses along proximal anterior interventricular groove. Long LAD after proximal course runs along right side of the interventricular territory into the distal interventricular groove. Type III—Short and long LAD originate from common LAD trunk. Short LAD courses along proximal anterior interventricular groove. Long LAD after proximal course gives a intra-myocardial course and then finishes in the distal interventricular groove. Type IV—Short LAD originates as branch of LMCA and Long LAD originates from the right side and is labeled in accordance to how it courses with respect to the great vessels.

Firstly, the RCA was dominant in all four cases described by Spindola-Franco _et al._ which contrasts with the dominant LCA we describe here. Secondly, the long branch seen on the left of this patient did not ever course in the interventricular septum but rather parallel to it, making it more specifically a diagonal branch .\n\n【20】As illustrated in this case, dual LAD anomalies complicate intervention in patients with diseased vessels. It can be difficult to determine anomalous courses if the vessel runs through the myocardium or inter-arterially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A short LAD (i.e. Types I–III) should not be interpreted as a completely occluded vessel. To help differentiate the two one should look for an avascular area near the left coronary artery without collaterals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although not demonstrated in this case, type IV dual LAD that travels between the aorta and pulmonary trunk has been implicated in sudden cardiac death associated with physical activity in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】It is theoretically impossible for any two patients to have the same coronary artery anatomy given small septal branches or distribution of vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, there can be large variation in the typical anatomy that one would expect. Therefore, it is imperative for cardiologists to be fully aware of the wide spectrum of possibilities to correctly evaluate and intervene when necessary. Intervention may be based on appropriate use criteria for revascularization and clinical judgment utilizing knowledge of distribution of epicardial blood supply. Moreover, surgeons must be aware of the anatomy to prevent ligation of anomalous vessels or inappropriate arteriotomy placement. Although it is possible to discover anomalies on coronary angiography it may be difficult to know the origin of some vessels without a 3D image 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we report a rare coronary artery anomaly of a dual LAD. This and other anomalies present challenges to cardiologists and surgeon in particular defining the distribution of myocardium supplied by these arteries and translating this information into clinically directed medical therapy.\n\n【23】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【24】Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:02:45", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:03:03", "cost": 18.041}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:03:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:02:45"}

In most cases, the urethral polyps would not be considered in the differential diagnosis process by a huge number of physicians, mainly owing to the rarity of documented cases in the medical literature and because of the wide variety of unspecified symptoms the urethral polyp might demonstrate. Urethral polyps are more common in males than in females, and they are usually diagnosed at an early age. Treatment options include transurethral resection, endoscopic suprapubic approach and open surgery. The disease prognosis is excellent as it does not usually recur after being completely removed and the risk of malignant transformation is very low. We are going to report a case of a 3-month-old boy who presented with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis, which revealed the presence of a large posterior urethral polyp.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Urethral polyps are irregular growths that occur in the urethra. They are rare, and they are more common in males than in females. Posterior urethral polyps (PUPs) are more frequent than anterior urethral polyps, which are very rare. John Hunter is credited with the first documented case of urethral polyps in the literature, which he described in an ox in 1763 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, whereas Thompson was the first to report this case in a patient in 1855 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 1899, Neuberger diagnosed the first urethral polyp using an endoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thus far, there has not been a plethora of documented cases about urethral polyps in the medical literature.\n\n【4】PUPs are benign irregular growths in the posterior urethra. Although the lesion is uncommon, it is considered as an important cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Because of its obstructive qualities, there is a wide range of clinical symptoms that include dysuria, recurrent urinary infections, hematuria and urinary retention. Infrequently, urethral polyps may be associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and hydronephrosis and this is what we are going to report in our case.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 3-month-old boy presented with a history of unexplained excessive crying episodes, mostly occur during micturition. On hospital admission, physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies including blood and urine tests were normal, as well. The patient underwent abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, which showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis involving the dilation of the entire ureters . Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed that revealed a moderate VUR on both sides . In addition, a dilation with a filling defect in the prostatic urethra was detected . Cystourethroscopy unfolded a urethral polyp 7.5 <sup>* </sup> 0.5 <sup>* </sup> 0.5 cm in size. The polyp pedicle was attached to the verumontanum ile the polyp extended into the bladder . We also detected a small diverticulum on the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of the lesion was done using endoscopic scissor, and the resescted mass was removed out of the urethra by urethral foreign body forceps . Histopathology examination showed that the lesion is a polyp lined with squamous epithelia and covered with a smooth muscle layer, with no signs of malignancy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Ultra sound imaging showed the hydroureteronephrosis on both sides.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|VCUG imaging was done.

The boy’s parents reported later that the micturition-related crying became significantly less recurrent.\n\n【13】1 year following the surgery, we conducted a new ultrasound and VCUG imaging which affirmed that the VUR and the hydronephrosis fully retreated on both sides . In addition, a follow-up cystoscopy was performed to confirm that there was no recurrence of the polyp.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|VCUG was repeated 1 year after removing the polyp. No filling defect, hydronephrosis nor VUR were detected.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Urethral polyps are uncommon benign polypoid masses of the urethra, and they typically manifest as single tumors rather than multiple separate masses. Until 2004, 181 cases of urethral polyps have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Since then, only a few cases have been found and described in the medical literature. Diagnosing urethral polyps might be difficult and carries a challenging differential diagnosis for clinical practitioners and physicians, because they are infrequent and they could present in a large variety of unspecified symptoms. Urethral polyps are notably more prevalent in males than in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In males, polyps that arise from the posterior urethra are significantly more frequent than anterior urethral polyps, which are rarely described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This entity is extremely rare in females, and it could be located in any part of the urethra without any specific common location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The pathogenesis of this condition is still poorly understood and controversial. However, congenital, irritating, septic, traumatic and obstructive factors have been discussed and proposed as potential causes for urethral polyps. Moore and Kuppusami suggest that maternal estrogen levels during gestation could cause secondary epithelial changes which in turn might develop urethral polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Because the higher portion of cases diagnosed around birth is seen in healthy newborns and most cases are diagnosed in the first decade of life, the congenital theory is considered the most reliable in explaining urethral polyp’s origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Urethral polyps are typically asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, the clinical manifestations are widely diverse and mainly associated with age. In early infancy, intensive crying especially while urinating is the most prominent symptom, whereas older patients often present with hematuria, dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infection and urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In regard with the obstructive characteristics of the lesion, repetitive urine retention and stasis could result in developing VUR and hydronephrosis. The polyp may protrude from the urethral meatus, mainly in females.\n\n【19】Although ultrasound imaging is important in the diagnosing process, it is not diagnostic and cannot detect the lesion successfully in most cases. VCUG assists in establishing diagnosis by showing a filling defect in the urethra and it also reveals accompanying comorbidities like VUR. The presence of urethral polyp is detected mainly by endoscopy and histologically confirmed by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The standard treatment for urethral polyps is endoscopic transurethral resection by either cold knife, scissor, electrocoagulation or laser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The resected polyp should be fully removed and taken out of the urethra, either by foreign body forceps or a stone basket. For polyps with larger sizes, turning the polyp into fragments and the removal of them all using a transurethral approach is the treatment of choice. Open approach surgery is indicated when the transurethral resection or the endoscopic suprapubic approach cannot be done. The urethral polyps prognosis is excellent, as the symptoms usually fully subside after proper management and the tendency of recurrence or malignant degeneration is seldom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The follow-up by doing ultrasonography and VCUG should be done after 1 year. This is what we did in our case making sure that there was no recurrence and no VUR or any other abnormalities.\n\n【22】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【23】Urethral polyps are always considered a distinctive medical case because they are rarely discussed and described in the literature and they could be demonstrated with a wide spectrum of symptoms. As it stands, they should always be considered as an important differential diagnosis for patients with voiding dysfunction or lower urinary tract symptoms, especially in the first decade of life.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is nobody to acknowledge.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests of personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding for this report.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the report meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written guardian consent statement has been obtained.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A.R.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:49", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:47:11", "cost": 21.549}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:47:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:49"}

Though her neuroimaging findings were atypical to those commonly found in CM, she was diagnosed with CM with a cryptococcal antigen test. However, in contrast to the good prognosis as stated in the literature, she died during her course stay at the hospital. Therefore, cryptococcosis should be taken as differentials, even in an immunocompetent individual presenting with features suggestive of meningitis, to prevent the worst clinical outcome.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a brain infection caused by the fungus Cryptococcus (either _Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii_ ). It is one of the most typical causes of meningitis in immunocompromised people, particularly those with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although antiretroviral drugs reduce the prevalence of CM in HIV patients, the trend in an immunocompetent host is assumed to rise over the years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Annually, there are 223 100 cases of CM worldwide with the largest burden in sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asian regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Common meningeal symptoms, such as headache and neck stiffness, are usually present in classic CM. However, other systemic signs of disseminated illness, such as pneumonia and dermatological symptoms, may also be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, evaluation of immunocompetent patients with subacute to chronic meningitis for _C. neoformans_ is needed. Even though serum cryptococcal antigen and radiographic imaging help identify CM, lumbar puncture is necessary for a conclusive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. The lumbar puncture with elevated opening pressure, predominantly mononuclear cells, demonstration of encapsulated yeast with India ink and positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture of the organism are typical findings confirming the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The examination for CM is infrequently performed in low-income countries like Nepal among immunocompetent individuals who exhibit meningitis-like symptoms since the diagnosis is frequently overlooked. Unfortunately, such an immunocompetent patient with CM carries a higher mortality rate than those with an immunosuppressed state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We present a case of a 29-year-old immunocompetent female who experienced chronic blurred vision, headaches and vomiting for 3 months before being diagnosed with CM.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-year-old married female presented to our center with complaints of intermittent headaches followed by vomiting for the last 3 months. Each episode of headache was acute in onset, located in the parieto-occipital region, moderate in intensity and associated with vomiting most of the time. The pain was slightly relieved with analgesics from the local pharmacy. But, for the last 20 days, the patient reported an increase in the frequency and severity of headaches and multiple vomiting episodes. She also had a fever but the temperature was not recorded. There was no history of trauma, chronic intake of medications, loss of consciousness, abnormal body movements and recent change in behaviors. There was no significant medical or surgical history suggestive of immunodeficiency. She was a reformed smoker and occasionally consumed alcohol.\n\n【8】At presentation, the patient was conscious and well oriented to time, place and person with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 out of 15. The sensory, motor, cranial nerve and cerebellar examination did not reveal any abnormal findings. The meningeal signs like neck stiffness and Kernig’s sign were absent. Direct ophthalmoscopic examination showed no evidence of optic disk swelling or papilledema. Vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure: 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute and temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) except for tachycardia (110 bpm). The systemic examination was unremarkable. Baseline investigations were within the reference range. The serum glucose measured was 90 mg/dl. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.\n\n【9】The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ring-like lesion in the left lentiform nucleus with an eccentric nodule and surrounding edema. These features were suggestive of neurocysticercosis (colloidal vesicular stage). Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done on the next day which revealed normal white cell count (less than five cells), high protein (50 mg/dl; 15–45 mg/dl), low glucose (30 mg/dl; 50–80 mg/dl) and normal adenosine deaminase (8 U/L; < 10 U/L) levels. The opening pressure was 12 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O. Gram staining showed multiple budding yeast cells resembling _Cryptococcus_ sp. Likewise, India ink preparation of the CSF sample showed a capsule structure resembling _C. neoformans_ . The diagnosis of CM was made a week after the admission. A part of the sample was sent outside for a cryptococcal antigen test as it was not available in our center.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MRI of head. ( **a** ) T2-weighted view. ( **b** ) FLAIR view. Red arrows showing ring-like lesion in the left lentiform nucleus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|India ink staining of CSF showing _C. neoformans._</u>\n\n【12】The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), and central venous and arterial access was obtained. Parenteral amphotericin B (liposomal; 3 mg/kg/day) was started for CM. Likewise, oral fluconazole (800 mg per day) was also administered as flucytosine was not available in our setting. Therapeutic CSF drainage was planned in case of persistent headache and/or vomiting. Other supportive treatment measures including chest physiotherapy and mobilization were provided. The following day of ICU admission, she developed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, which was managed conservatively. She developed hypotension (90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (112 bpm) and tachypnea (26 breaths per minute). The serum lactate level was elevated (4.5 mmol/L), and the diagnosis of septic shock was made. Noradrenaline (10 mcg/min) was started for the same. Parenteral meropenem (1 g every 8 h) was added for worsening oxygenation with the differential diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50–55%, severe tricuspid regurgitation with estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg and severely dilated right cardiac chambers. Therefore, furosemide (80 mg IV) was administered for volume overload.\n\n【13】In the meantime, the antigen test for _Cryptococcus_ came back positive. The septic shock resolved gradually, and the noradrenaline infusion was stopped. Therapeutic lumbar puncture was done for 2 days and 23 mL of CSF was removed as the opening pressure was high (>35 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O; 10–20 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O). The rest of the intensive care and monitoring was continued. But, after 2 days of slight improvement (clinically), the condition of the patient suddenly deteriorated, and ultimately, she passed away on the 7th day of her ICU stay. The actual cause of the death could not be determined as the postmortem examination was not conducted.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】In contrast to Cryptococcosis that is considered a classical disease with certain underlying diseases pathology or predisposing factors, cryptococcosis in phenotypically normal individuals is on the rise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The global burden of CM in the immunocompromised population, particularly in the HIV-AIDS population, has been extended with an estimated prevalence of 6.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A comprehensive report from 2015 estimates the total burden of CM (in HIV/AIDS and immunocompromised patients) to be 164 (0.6 per 100 000) in Nepal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The occurrence of CM in immunocompetent individuals (non-HIV and non-transplant patients) has been increasing steadily with most centers reporting up to 20% of cases in the non-immunocompromised population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. According to a study by Hevey _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the 90-day mortality was higher in immunocompetent groups (41.1%) as compared with immunocompromised groups (15.2% in HIV and 12.2% in transplant groups).\n\n【16】Two fungi are implicated in invasive cryptococcosis, _C. neoformans_ and _C. gatti_ , both encapsulated yeasts. However, _C. neoformans_ has been associated with the immunocompromised host in contrast to _C. gatti_ , which is shown to occur with immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Cryptococcus species have a propensity for the central nervous system, particularly in immunocompromised patients, because of their multiple virulence factors. However, CM in immunocompetent patients is difficult to explain. The possible explanations could be because of exposure to cryptococcal strain with high pathogenicity, high level of pathogen exposure, or subtle or undetectable immune deficits. Such deficits could be because of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus or autoimmune conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our case did not have any of those subtle causes for immune deficits, because of which we labeled our case as apparently immunocompetent.\n\n【17】The Cryptococcus species, in immunocompetent individuals, have more propensity for developing pulmonary cryptococcosis than in immunocompromised individuals. Similarly, the neuroimaging findings are more localized and include hydrocephalus in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. The clinical picture of CM in immunocompetent patients tends to have typical features including fever, stiff neck, headache, vomiting or altered mental status in contrast to immunocompromised individuals, who have only subtle clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Regarding our case, she had neurological involvement with fever and vomiting as the initial presentation and later neurological deterioration. The neuroimaging findings did not show hydrocephalus, instead had a ring-enhancing lesion resembling findings of the colloidal vesicular stage of neurocysticercosis. However, there can be findings in imaging like cerebral infarction, granulomas and pseudocysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As for Nepal, in two case reports of CM in immunocompetent patients, both had apparently immunocompetent patients without any subtle immune deficits. And with the appropriate treatment as per recommended guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>, both had good prognoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. However, it was quite the opposite regarding our patient, who died during the course of treatment in the ICU of our center. This could be possibly because of neurological deterioration secondary to raised intracranial pressure. There is conflicting evidence on the prognosis of CM in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with some favoring immunocompetent individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. However, mortality can also be pertinent in immunocompetent individuals because of the unavailability of investigative tools, frequent overlooking of the diagnosis and delayed presentation.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】Hence, cryptococcosis should be considered despite an apparent immunocompetent individual without any known comorbid conditions presenting with features suggestive of meningitis.

ORN of the skull has not been reported following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We report two cases of ORN of the skull following SRS for recurrent meningiomas post-resection. Both patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps in areas that received high doses of radiation due to their proximity to the recurrent tumors. In each case, the ORN was asymptomatic and was detected on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging. Both patients were followed closely with imaging that ultimately revealed either stability or improvement in the ORN, confirming the diagnosis without the need for biopsy. The cases reveal a role for close imaging surveillance instead of immediate biopsy in patients with new enhancement involving bone in high-dose radiation treatment regions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Osteoradionecrosis (ORN), ischemic necrosis of irradiated bone without evidence of persisting or recurrent tumor, is a known complication of radiation therapy, particularly in patients with head and neck cancer. The exact mechanism is unknown; however, the proposed mechanism is that radiation-induced vascular changes result in diminished blood flow and ultimately in a hypocellular, hypovascular and hypoxic environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While often asymptomatic, symptoms and sequelae of ORN can vary in severity and include pain, fracture, chronic non-healing wounds and superimposed infections. To date, literature review did not reveal any reports of ORN of the calvarium following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We present two cases of ORN of the calvarium following SRS for recurrent meningiomas after initial resection.\n\n【4】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】The first patient is a 50-year-old woman with history of a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I meningioma in the parieto-occipital region, which was resected in 1999 with subsequent radiographic recurrence. Initial post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal residual tumor and annual MRIs were stable for 7 years. She was then lost to follow-up until 2012 when an MRI revealed a 25-mm contrast-enhancing lesion at the resection cavity consistent with meningioma recurrence, and corresponding computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of adjacent bone erosion . The patient was treated with linear accelerator-based, framed SRS (14 Gy in one fraction) to the recurrent meningioma. She did well without issues for 5 years except for the interval development a 9 mm focus of enhancement within the surrounding brain parenchyma that resolved in ~6 months without intervention and was ascribed to radiation treatment effect (RTE).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Case 1 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI axial slice obtained at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (white arrow) and ( **B** ) comparable axial CT slice also obtained at the time of SRS; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 4 years post-SRS and ( **D** ) at the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **E** ) CT at the time of development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **F** ) corresponding relative cerebral blood volume map (from dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging) reveals relative hypoperfusion of the enhancing lesion (denoted by white arrowhead; red = increased perfusion, blue = decreased perfusion).</u>\n\n【8】The patient’s MRI at 5 years post-SRS revealed a new enhancing lesion immediately adjacent to the treated meningioma, which in retrospect may have begun developing 4 years post-SRS . This lesion involved the craniotomy bone flap, and a head CT confirmed a new 38-mm osteolytic focus involving that segment of the cranium . Perfusion MRI showed relative hypoperfusion at this site . After examination of all available images, including overlay of the SRS isodose cloud , the appearance was most consistent with ORN. Repeat brain MRIs and head CTs 6 months and 1.5 years later revealed the stability of this lytic lesion as well as the residual treated meningioma . The patient remained asymptomatic with the exception of rare episodes of minor focal scalp discomfort. Given the continued stability, this process was determined to be most consistent with ORN and biopsy was not pursued.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Case 1 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion.

No adjuvant therapy was pursued. She did well until a brain MRI in 2017 demonstrated a 2.1-cm recurrence along the superior sagittal sinus with no adjacent bone erosion on CT . She was asymptomatic and was treated with linear-accelerator-based, hypofractionated frameless SRS (30 Gy in five fractions) to the recurrent tumor. The patient did well for the next 2 years with significant tumor response except for the development of RTE in a small region of surrounding brain, which resolved without intervention.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Case 2 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained in 2017 at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (denoted by arrowhead) and ( **B** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice windowed for bone at that same timepoint; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained at the time of development of an enhancing lesion involving bone at 1-year post-SRS (denoted by arrow) and ( **D** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice obtained at the that same timepoint revealing the lytic bone lesion at this site (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【13】On serial imaging, an MRI 1-year post-SRS showed a new adjacent enhancing lesion that was associated with some bone lysis seen on CT without apparent growth of the treated meningioma . T1 post-contrast MRI and non-contrast head CT 3 months later revealed mild enlargement of the lesion . At this point, the differential diagnosis included ORN versus tumor progression. After discussion at tumor board, her case was felt to more likely represent ORN as the lytic lesion was within the high-dose region, as demonstrated on the isodose overlay . Further close interval monitoring was recommended. The next brain MRI 9 months after the development of the lytic lesion revealed stability of both the treated meningioma and the adjacent enhancing lesion , supporting the diagnosis of ORN.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Case 2 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI and ( **B** ) comparable CT sagittal slices obtained 3 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion; ( **C** ) the radiation isodose is overlayed on the preceding CT showing that the high-dose region (red) corresponds to the location of the osteolytic lesion (presumed ORN) in this case; ( **D** ) sagittal T1 post-contrast MRI slice at 9 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of ORN of the skull following SRS. ORN is a known complication of radiation therapy most frequently reported following radiation to the head and neck. ORN can range in severity from being asymptomatic to causing pain, fractures, superimposed infection and chronic wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Management includes vitamin E and pentoxifylline for mild cases and hyperbaric oxygen and surgical resection for more severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The mechanism of ORN is thought to involve inflammation and fibrosis of the periosteal vessels, resulting in ischemia and avascular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The mandible is particularly susceptible due to its relatively low vascularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but ORN can affect other bones such as ribs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u> and vertebra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These two patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps after SRS to adjacent recurrent meningiomas.\n\n【18】After careful review in a multidisciplinary setting, the decision was made to follow the patients closely with imaging as opposed to proceeding with biopsy due to the high clinical suspicion for ORN. In each case, the craniotomy flap was within the high-dose region . The risk of ORN increases with increasing dose to the affected bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. It is likely that post-surgical disruption of blood flow to these flaps was confounded by vascular changes secondary to high-dose radiation leading to ORN.\n\n【19】Diagnostic considerations in such cases include ORN and tumor recurrence. The definitive way to make a diagnosis is through pathology review; however, an invasive procedure can often be avoided using serial imaging in asymptomatic patients. Stability of the lesion without intervention favors a diagnosis of ORN over tumor recurrence. Perfusion imaging can distinguish between malignancy and radiation necrosis in the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Radiation necrosis displays hypoperfusion, as was illustrated in the first case of ORN above, whereas malignancy displays hyperperfusion. While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to make the diagnosis, these cases demonstrate that, in patients with indolent courses, it is generally prudent to closely observe with imaging. In such cases, serial imaging revealing stability or improvement of the lesion(s) in question can solidify a diagnosis of ORN, avoiding an invasive procedure.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained from patients in both cases.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ashley Schlafstein.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:10", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:15", "cost": 4.909}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:09"}

Moreover, there is no standard treatment for ISR, and although many options are available, there is still limited data regarding its optimal management. We report a paradigmatic case report of a patient complaining of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, underwent multiple endovascular revascularizations for recurrent femoro-popliteal ISR. A step-by-step approach was followed. At the time of the first presentation, the ISR was treated by drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty. The repeated ISR was treated by laser debulking, achieving a good angiographic result. Finally, after the third repeated restenosis, a combined approach with laser debulking and DEB angioplasty guaranteed a good acute angiographic result. Long-term duplex-scan follow-up demonstrated the good patency of the femoro-popliteal target lesion.\n\n【2】A 53-year-old man treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and bare-metal stent in the left superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk 1 year earlier , presented with recurrent symptoms of Rutherford stage 3 claudication. He was an active heavy smoker since he was 18 years old and hypercholesterolemic on treatment with statins. No other cardiovascular risk factors or diseases were reported in the past medical history. He was scheduled to repeat the lower limb revascularization. Selective angiography revealed severe in-stent restenosis (ISR) (i.e. Tosaka class 2), which was treated with PTA and paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) (Inpact Pacific 4.0/150 and 5.0/80, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) with a satisfactory result . After 18 months, the patient suffered rapidly evolving recurrent pain at rest. Duplex scan and angiography revealed recurrent ISR, with a focal pattern (Tosaka class 1). Re-intervention was carried out with lesion debulking with excimer laser atheractomy (TurboTandem, Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO) followed by re-PTA with paclitaxel DEB (Inpact Admiral 4.0/120 and 5.0/120, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Clara, CA), with good immediate result .

Currently, there is no standard treatment for ISR, and although many options are available, there is still limited data regarding its optimal management. In this paradigmatic case, we have shown that re-intervention after SFA is common, and different approaches have been needed to achieve longer-term results. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis confidently show that PTA with DEB is superior to plain balloon angioplasty in terms of patency rate and target lesion revascularization, reducing the risk of re-intervention by 56% at 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Yet, results with different types of DEB have been inconsistent. Hence, given the heterogeneous clinical response to different DEB technologies, results from trials should be considered device-specific rather than class-specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In our case, treatment with DEB provided good immediate results, but focal ISR was evident within 18 months. A mixed technique including both atheractomy and DEB angioplasty provided better results. At difference with de-novo atherosclerosis, ISR is predominantly caused by neointimal hyperplasia, with excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells and hydrated collagen matrix. Direct removal of this tissue with atheractomy and subsequent elution of antiproliferative drug through DEB could provide more durable results. To date, only one RCT compared DEB alone with atheractomy plus DEB, showing better stent patency at 12 months, with roughly halved ISR rates in the experimental arm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These data are in line with our explanatory case, yet this was a single center, relatively small, study. In addition, results from this trial do not necessarily apply to all kinds of atheractomy devices. The optimal treatment for ISR is still unknown, and future studies testing DEB (and types thereof), atheractomy (and types thereof), covered stents or drug-eluting stents should be rigorously conducted to provide novel insights in this field.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest must be declared.</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This is an own work.

The severity of WHS is directly related to the extent of the deletion; mild WHS has a 3- to 5-Mb deletion, classic WHS has a moderate size deletion of 5–18 Mb, and severe WHS is seen with deletions >22 Mb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The typical craniofacial phenotype is described as a ‘Greek warrior helmet appearance’ with hypertelorism, a prominent glabella, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly and micrognathia.

She had ongoing poor growth, moderate developmental delay and developed generalized seizures at the age of 18 months, and started on anti-convulsants. Investigations included normal karyotype (46XX), GH testing (peak GH 35 µg/l; normal >7 µg/l) and unremarkable metabolic evaluation. Microarray confirmed a 3.7-Mb deletion in the region of 4p16.2-p16.3. She had absent middle phalanges of the third and fifth toes bilaterally. At 3.5 years of age, her height was −4.6 SDS, BMI −4.0 SDS and siting height −5.1 SDS, with a bone age of 1.2 years. GH was started at 4 years of age , and was associated with increased height to −3.5 and −2.5 SDS after 1 and 2 years, respectively, and at 9.5 years, −1.64 SDS (5th percentile). GH was stopped by the parents at 9.5 years; this was followed by a marked deceleration of growth.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Height during GH therapy in Case 1, blue boxes represent bone age.</u>\n\n【8】CASE 2\n------\n\n【9】Case 2 was born from non-consanguineous parents (mid-parental height 50%) at 36 weeks, and birth weight of 1867 kg (−2.1 SDS). She had a single kidney on ultrasound and a cleft palate. She had ongoing poor growth and was gastrostomy fed at 2 years of age with little effect on growth. She developed moderate developmental delay and also generalized seizures at ∼18 months, and started on anti-convulsants. Investigations included normal karyotype (46XX), GH testing (peak GH 15 µg/l) and general screen. WHS was confirmed with a FISH probe showing a 4p16.3 deletion. Her father had a balanced translocation t(4;14). At 2.6 years of age, her height was −3.4 SDS and BMI −4.8 SDS. She had facial features of WHS and a bone age of 2.0 years. GH was started at 3.3 years of age , and was associated with an increase in height to −2.5 and –2.1 SDS after 1 and 2 years, respectively. At 6.8 years of age, her height is −2.1 SDS.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Height during GH therapy in Case 2, blue boxes represent bone age.</u>\n\n【11】There have been no complications of GH treatment and no increase in seizures in either case.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Children with idiopathic short stature and poor growth in New Zealand are eligible for publically funded treatment with GH in the same dose as used in these cases. In a systematic audit of non-syndromic, GH-sufficient children, the median increase for height was +0.46 SDS (interquartile range 0.19, 0.76) in the first year of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The present two cases show that GH treatment of WHS in childhood can achieve a similar or potentially even greater acceleration of growth. Indeed, Case 1 showed continuing improvement in height into the normal range. Although there is one published case of WHS suggesting possible partial GH deficiency, with a borderline GH level (peak GH 7.8 ng/ml and normal for laboratory >10 ng/ml) with a low IGF-1 level (35 µg/l) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, in both the present cases, GH responses were unequivocally normal.\n\n【14】These cases add to the very limited published experience, suggesting that GH therapy for WHS is associated with sustained acceleration of growth during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9–11 \\]</u>. We were able to identify only one previous case for which the response was described in detail. In that case that had normal GH testing and low normal level of IGF-1.

However, her predicted adult height only increased by 4 cm to 153.1 due to skeletal maturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This response is highly similar in case 1.\n\n【15】In conclusion, these cases suggest that, in selected children with WHS and severe short stature, GH therapy may have a substantial effect on long-term growth.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to gratefully acknowledge the families of these two cases.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:32", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:37", "cost": 5.306}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:31"}

The small perforating end branches are especially vulnerable to damage from elevated blood pressure in locations such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and pons.\n\n【6】Although all brain tumors are known to convey a risk of bleeding, medical teams tend to associate tumoral intra-cerebral hemorrhages with the presence of malignancies. The types of malignant tumors that are most associated with localized hemorrhages are glioblastomas, lymphomas, oligodendrogliomas and metastatic tumors, the last of which encompass melanomas, choriocarcinomas, renal cell carcinomas and bronchogenic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Contrastingly, the types of benign tumors that have been associated with intracerebral hemorrhages include meningiomas, pituitary adenomas and hemangioblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】The factors that determine the prognosis and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the patient’s age, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, the location of hematoma and the presence of an intra-ventricular component. All the aforementioned factors are also considered to calculate the intracranial hemorrhage score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 50-year-old patient presented to the emergency room complaining of having suffered, for an entire day, from a sudden pulsatile hemicranial headache of moderate intensity, associated with nausea, no emetic episodes and that was also not responding to the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Due to the persistence of the symptomatology, the patient sought medical attention and the initial diagnosis suggested a secondary headache. After careful examination, the patient was found to be free of neurological deficit and the medical team performed a brain CT scan.\n\n【10】The resulting image documented a cortico-subcortical hyperdense lesion (50 Hounsfield Units) in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe, measuring 41 × 32 × 36 mm and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc, commonly associated with cases of vasogenic edema compromising the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The amplitude of the left lateral ventricle and the width of the regional subarachnoid space sulci had decreased on account of the lesion, and a minimal deviation of the midline structures to the right and incipient left uncal herniation was noted. To rule out an underlying vascular malformation, the medical team performed a CT angiogram, which did not show any aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Head computerized tomography CT.</u>\n\n【12】Due to the absence of neurological deficit, the medical team propounded that a brain hemorrhage could not be adjudged as the sole etiology and subsequently ordered an MRI scan. The results revealed a lobulated mass with prominent enhancement after the gadolinium injection and marked hypo intensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information. A zone in contact with the internal bone table was observed at the lateral margin of the lesion, as well as various dark regions at the susceptibility weighted sequence, suggesting blood products or calcium. The FLAIR sequence showed significant surrounding vasogenic edema. The aforementioned characteristics were found to be consistent with an atypical meningioma or a metastatic lesion .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|MRI—fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|MRI—susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|MRI—gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequence.</u>\n\n【16】Additional neck, chest and abdominal CT scans were performed, and the results allowed the ruling out of metastatic disease, furthermore, increasing the probability of an underlying primary tumor of the central nervous system. The patient underwent surgery, where resulted in the identification of a solid lesion, without an intra-tumoral hemorrhagic component, as previously suspected in accordance with the pre-operative imaging findings .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Macroscopic lesion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 6**|删除段之间换行|Macroscopic lesion.</u>\n\n【19】After the surgical intervention, the patient presented a stable neurological evolution with no apparent deterioration and was discharged following 4 days of post-operative surveillance.

These findings were deemed compatible with the diagnosis of fibroblastic meningioma WHO I, emphasizing that they were not suggestive of anaplastic meningioma or atypical meningioma.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 7**|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin–eosin staining.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 8**|删除段之间换行|Vimentin staining.</u>\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】The radiological findings in this case are particularly intriguing, due to the fact that the initial evaluation suggested a large acute hemorrhagic component—because of its high density in scans (50 Hounsfield Units) and its marked hypointensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information—but, at the time of the surgical resection, a mass of solid consistency was found, without any type of hemorrhage.\n\n【24】Given that acute blood is markedly hyperdense in comparison to the brain parenchyma, its tomographic diagnosis regularly does not pose a high grade of difficulty for medical teams. However, in this case, we were faced with an entirely solid lesion that mimicked an intracerebral hemorrhage. The tests ordered by the medical team included a CT angiogram to rule out a possible vascular etiology, as the patient’s symptomatology was not consistent with a primary hemorrhage. In the authors’ opinion, this is the most significant aspect of this case study, in terms of its possible contribution to medical literature and its potential of serving as reference material for other healthcare professionals assessing patients who report a similar array of symptoms.\n\n【25】In developing nations, medical institutions are typically constrained by multiple external factors that directly compromise the availability of primary imaging techniques, such as MRI scanning. In cases where diagnostic MRI equipment is found to be entirely unavailable, medical teams must judiciously evaluate each patient’s condition, to determine whether he should be immediately referred to a higher level facility or remain under surveillance after a CT scan. In this case, the patient presented to the ER with a diagnosis of a ‘large intracerebral hemorrhage’ but displayed no neurological deficit. Such a scenario was deemed unlikely by the medical team, given the absence of cognitive impairment, and thus, the symptoms were thought to be the result of a slow-growing lesion.\n\n【26】In accordance with the findings of this case, the authors pose that all medical teams evaluating the results of a Head CT scan must consider the correlation between the images and the patient’s neurological status (i.e. a patient with no neurological deficit, associated with a large hyperdense lesion, most probably relates to a tumor with intra-lesional hemorrhage, rather than a single hemorrhage). Additionally, this case allowed the authors to identify a valuable opportunity in the development of a computer-based algorithm—specially directed at medical centers with CT scanners, but lacking MRI imaging equipment—which marks the cases in which an extra imaging study should be ordered, starting with those ‘hyperdense lesions’ located in eloquent areas with no neurological deficit association.\n\n【27】As it was stated before, the patient’s neurological status during admission was undamaged, which is highly unlikely in patients with hemorrhages in the same location and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc. Had that been the case for our patient, at least, a minimum degree of neurological compromise would have been expected, as the volume of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is directly proportional to morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Type III collagen is a member of the fibrillar collagen family and is colocalized with the most abundant member of the family, type I collagen, in such tissues as blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, leading the medical team to the conclusion that the high content of intercellular collagen and reticulin was the most probable cause for the hyperdensity evidenced in the tomographic image and the hypodensity on T2 weighted images, and for the dark areas evidenced on the susceptibility weighted images, thereby mimicking an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Julian Gualdrón-Durán in the edition and preparation of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The case report was reviewed and accepted by the institutional review board from our institution.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Full verbal and written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Oscar Hernando Feo-Lee is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:36:22", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:36:33", "cost": 11.67}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:36:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:36:22"}

Non-surgical treatment options for oligometastatic CRC confined to the liver which represents an intermediate state in the metastatic cascade are fast expanding. Currently, several liver-directed local therapeutic options are available, such as hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy, radio-frequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), stereotactic body radiotherapy and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). Many factors such as patient’s fitness, liver function (LF), tumour size, location of the tumour in the liver and scheduling of systemic therapy need to be considered when selecting patients for surgery or local liver-directed therapy. This case report illustrates a successful local treatment with staged HDRBT for a large and unresectable, liver only oligometastatic disease from CRC. This patient underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy (FOLFOX 4) followed by primary tumour resection and first stage of HDRBT to liver for a residual 14 cm tumour after the chemotherapy. After completing a further 4 cycles of chemotherapy with the same regimen, the tumour remained stable at 8 cm. She underwent a second stage of HDRBT to the same lesion and a repeat PET-CT scan done 8 weeks after the second HDRBT showed complete metabolic response. To our knowledge, this is the largest CRC metastatic liver lesion that has been successfully treated with HDRB.\n\n【2】Case Report , Brachytherapy , Liver Metastasis , Oligometastasis , Colorectal cancer\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】It is estimated that 25-30% of patients with colorectal cancer develop liver metastasis, and around one third of them have oligometastatic liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. For these patients, complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. However, surgical resection is possible in less than 20% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, which sheds light on the importance of non-surgical treatment options. These options include radio-frequency ablation (RFA), trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We present a patient in which the strategy of pairing HDRBT sequentially with systemic chemotherapy resulted in the complete metabolic response of a large unresectable colorectal liver metastasis which is illustrated as a timeline .\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 59-year-old lady was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colorectal Adenocarcinoma with isolated Liver metastasis (T2N0M1). She was not a suitable candidate for surgery, and was referred for further oncological treatment.\n\n【7】Blood tests revealed significant liver impairment, with a Child’s Pugh Score of B8. Total Bilirubin (3.37 mg/dL), AST(130 U/L) and ALP (603 U/L) were elevated, while Albumin (34 g/L) was normal. As for her FBC, she had low Haemoglobin (10.5 g/dL), elevated White Cell Counts (12.3 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and normal platelet count (371 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【8】A CT scan revealed a likely primary tumour at the proximal colon, a liver mass measuring 17.8 x 11.3 x 14.4 cm , with elevated CEA at 4410 ng/mL. At the end of the entire course of treatment, CEA dropped to 5.06 ng/mL, suggesting that the liver metastasis originated from the sigmoid colon.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Timeline of Events.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was treated with a combination of liver HDRBT sandwiched between systemic chemotherapy.\n\n【11】She underwent 4 cycles of systemic FOLFOX 4 chemotherapy and a CT scan afterwards showed that the liver lesion shrunk to 14.2 x 9.7 cm. Chemotherapy was however complicated by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. She then consented to brachytherapy to control the liver lesion during this chemotherapy break, with the initial intention of shrinking the lesion as a bridge to surgical resection.\n\n【12】In January, the patient underwent her first Brachytherapy procedure. A dose of 15Gy was given to the periphery of the tumour  via four brachytherapy applicators using Iridium 192 afterloader. Catheters were inserted using the anterior and right lateral approach. The applicators were placed in a way to adequately cover the entire tumour, with the first catheter inserted centrally within the tumour and the rest spaced out to cover the periphery of the tumour.\n\n【13】6 weeks later, an MRI scan showed good response with a 9.0 x 5.7 x 7.7 cm residual lesion.\n\n【14】The patient underwent further 4 cycles of chemotherapy. After the 5th cycle, she had a colectomy with end to end anastomosis to remove the primary tumour. Despite the reduced size of the liver lesion, the hepatobiliary surgeon deemed the mass unresectable due to the involvement of major vessels.\n\n【15】After 7 cycles, total bilirubin was 0.70 mg/dL and CEA dropped to 81. PET-CT scan still showed a remaining 7 x 6 cm metabolic active lesion with standardised uptake value (SUV) of 8.2. However, we were unable to complete the 8th cycle due to chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia.\n\n【16】She then underwent a second round of brachytherapy. A higher ablative dose of 25Gy was prescribed to the periphery of the lesion, with 90% of the lesion receiving 37.5Gy.\n\n【17】PET-CT scan after 8 weeks showed complete metabolic response . There was an ametabolic tumour of 6.8 x 4.2 x 6.7 cm in size, SUV decreased from 8.1 to 4.8 units. Her total Bilirubin was 1.05 mg/dL, and CEA dropped to 5.06, but Albumin was noted to be at 28 g/L. On clinical examination, the patient was noted to have mild ascites.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT scan showing liver metastasis at diagnosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT scan demonstrating liver metastasis post 4 cycles of chemotherapy.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Stage 1 Brachytherapy Plan.

Excellent clinical and biochemical results were achieved with a sharp fall in CEA from 4410 ng/ml to 5.06 ng/ml. The tumour regressed considerably with complete metabolic response. HDRBT liver has shown to be an excellent treatment option in this patient by inducing complete response in a very large unresectable tumour.\n\n【27】The first stage of brachytherapy with 15Gy after the initial 4 cycles of chemotherapy was to cytoreduce the tumour as it was too large for a curative dose. Liver size is not a major selection criterion provided that not more than 1/3 of normal liver receives more than 5Gy. RFA in contrast is not suitable due to the large tumour size and proximity to large vessels and bile ducts. Evidence shows that the main intra-hepatic bile ducts can withstand high doses of brachytherapy without significant toxicity unlike thermal heating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Compared to SBRT, HDRBT has less issues with respiratory motion. A sharper dose fall off outside the target margin is another advantage of HDRBT in delivering tumoricidal doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HDRBT delivers a single large and precise dose to the tumour while sparring the surrounding normal liver tissues, increasing its therapeutic ratio. HDRBT is an ‘in-side out technique’ where extreme doses in multiplication of 2-3 times of the prescribed dose are delivered near the applicator, ideal for overcoming radioresistance due to tumour hypoxia. This is relevant as the large tumour predisposes it to tumour hypoxia in the core. Evidence on the use of HDRBT for liver tumours are growing in the literature and ESMO guidelines have recognized HDRBT liver as a local liver directed treatment option for CRC metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Generally HDRBT is a well-tolerated procedure. Fever within a few hours after the procedure is common. Minor complications like pain, nausea, vomiting, and asymptomatic pleural effusion 12 to 24 hours after treatment have been reported in about 10% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Rare major complications include liver abscess and subcapsular bleeding needing transfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In conclusion, this approach of sandwiching HDRBT with systemic chemotherapy for large liver tumours needs to be further studied. This 2 stage approach of initial lower dose cytoreduction of tumour followed by an ablative dose of brachytherapy has proven to be a successful strategy in controlling the large liver metastasis in this case, that has not been previously described.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the patient for her consent to allow us to publish her medical information and story in this manuscript.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest to be declared.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have obtained written consent from the patient.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.K.A.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Department and institution address where research was conducted: Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Advanced Medical & Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bertam 13200 Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang Malaysia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:35:43", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:35:56", "cost": 12.383}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:33", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:35:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:35:43"}

We present a case of rapid onset of systolic dysfunction with cardiogenic shock, which developed after the surgical excision of an adrenal gland tumor in a 60-year-old male. Coronary angiography excluded coronary artery disease. The echocardiography and ventriculography images suggested Takotsubo cardiomyopathy pattern. Following 2 weeks of inotropic and vasopressor therapy, the left ventricular function gradually improved, until complete resolution.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare catecholamine-producing tumors (0.2–0.6% of hypertensive patients; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>), which could appear sporadically or be part of a hereditary syndrome.

Upon admission the patient was hemodynamically stable: blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen levels within normal range.

His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and negative T waves in the lateral leads. The echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, no regional wall motion abnormalities and a moderate aortic regurgitation. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> amounted to 1 point and showed a class II risk.\n\n【8】The patient underwent standard lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy using four trocars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. During dissection, even gentle manipulation of the tumor caused spikes of arterial pressure up to 180 mmHg but all receded after control of the main left adrenal vein . During the surgery, after the removal of the tumor, the patient became hemodynamically unstable. He presented hypotension (50/30 mmHg) and new onset bundle branch block (LBBB). He was moved directly to the angiography room and emergency coronarography was performed. The ventriculography described circumferential midventricular akinesia . The coronarography showed no obstructive atherosclerotic disease of epicardial vessels, low flow TIMI 2 and no vasospasm ). The patient had important dynamic changes in troponin levels (a maximum value of 21.9 ng/ml on the second-postoperative day, with an upper reference limit \\[URL\\] of 0.2 ng/ml) and high NT-proBNP values (a maximum value of 7000 pg/ml on the second-postoperative day with an URL of 300 pg/ml). He stayed in intensive care unit for 12 days requiring inotropic and vasopressor support and for the first three days he required intubation and mechanical ventilation _._ The left ventricular systolic function improved gradually. On the 12th day after the surgery, the patient no longer required oxygen or vasopressors and was transferred to the Cardiology Department. On the 15th-postoperative day, the echocardiography showed a left ventricle with no regional motion abnormalities), normal troponin levels and the electrocardiogram no longer presented LBBB . The pathology report described a pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score (PASS) of seven, which rendered the tumor as biologically aggressive. Furthermore, one out of seven resected lymph nodes had similar tumor cells, thus the tumor was staged as pT3N1 (TNM). At the 1-month follow up, the patient had normal blood pressure values (120/75 mmHg) and preserved LVEF (55%).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Ventriculogram showing left ventricular „ballooning”—midventricular akinesia ( **A** ) Telesystolic and ( **B** ) Teledyastolic; ( **C** ) Coronary angiography showing right coronary artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis; ( **D** ) Coronary angiography showing left main, left descending artery and circumflex artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Electrocardiogram ( **A** ) Before the surgery; ( **B** ) Immediately after the surgery; ( **C** ) on the 15th-postoperative day.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】We present the case of a patient with no history of systolic dysfunction who developed Takotsubo syndrome (TS) after the surgical removal of a pheochromocytoma, which raised complex issues regarding diagnosis and treatment. Pheochromocytomas are rare, catecholamine secreting tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An even rarer occurrence is the coexistence of pheochromocytoma and TS, probably due to catecholamine excess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The patient was monitored closely by the anesthesia care team and drugs which could promote catecholamine release were avoided. During the surgery, as the patient became hemodynamically unstable, the differential diagnosis consisted of acute coronary syndrome, hypovolemic shock and anesthesia induced hypotension. Because the condition manifested as acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock and electrocardiographic changes, coronary artery disease had to be ruled out. The patient’s recent history showed no indication of a viral infection, no inflammatory markers present and no pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Following the diagnostic algorithm of TS, the patient started with an InterTAK Score of low/intermediate probability, the coronary angiography showed no coronary lesions, he had no red flags of acute myocarditis and after 15 days he had no wall motion abnormalities, which leads to the diagnosis of TS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Sympathetic activation has a central role in the pathophysiology of TS, with high levels of circulating catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Therefore, the management of the patient was based on inotropic and vasopressors agents, while attempting to avoid any adrenergic agonists, as they could aggravate the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. When the patient became hemodynamically unstable, he was treated at first with dobutamine and noradrenaline. Then, he was started on levosimendane and vasopressin. But, as the blood pressure could not be elevated, he also received noradrenaline. Gathering all the arguments, we conclude that this case was a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, a transient systolic dysfunction associated with the surgical stress of the removal of a catecholamine secreting tumor.\n\n【15】TS is a complex pathology, frequently associated with an excess of catecholamines, which requires careful consideration regarding diagnosis and treatment. We regard this case as a suddenly acquired, reversible systolic dysfunction associated with the perioperative surgical stress of the removal of a pheochromocytoma.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Irina Tudose, Dr Vlad Mageriu.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this work.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been obtained from the patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:44:46", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:00", "cost": 74.087}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:44:45"}

We report a case of a 55-year-old woman who presented to hospital with headaches, petechial rashes and bruising—7 days after receiving her first vaccine dose. Blood tests showed low platelets, a markedly high d-dimer and positive anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies. Computed tomography (CT) of head and venogram showed features consistent with venous sinus thrombosis. She was immediately started on IV pooled immunoglobulin therapy, high-dose prednisolone and full anticoagulation. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of head and venogram supported the initial CT findings, with features suggestive of a small-volume venous sinus thrombosis. Additionally, CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a right-sided segmental pulmonary embolism. Our case highlights the importance of increased awareness of this complication after covid vaccination and how searching for distal thrombotic events and liaison with tertiary centres influence clinical outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The global outbreak of coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), prompted the development of several vaccinations to reduce the prevalence and serious adverse effects of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In February 2021, several cases of thrombotic events were noted after the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccination—a recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral vector encoding the glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The European Medicines Agency reported rare thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after receipt of the AstraZeneca vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

She presented to her general practitioner (GP) who treated her for a urinary tract infection due to microscopic haematuria.\n\n【12】She represented to her GP 1 week later with persistent symptoms and a new rash on her lower legs . She was otherwise fit and well. Regular medications were ramipril and atorvastatin. She had hypertension. There was no personal or family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and no recent travel history. She had no evidence of dyslipidaemia and a normal body mass index.\n\n【13】She was referred to secondary care after blood tests revealed a platelet count of 25 × 10^9/l (baseline platelet count was 299 × 10^9/l).\n\n【14】Observations showed a heart rate of 117 beats/minute, apyrexial, saturating 96% on room air. Examination confirmed a lower limb diffuse petechial rash and peripheral bruising.\n\n【15】Significant bloods were a platelet count of 22 109/l (Ref. range: 135–450/l), markedly elevated d-dimer of 23 704 ng/ml (Ref. range: 0–500/l) and a fibrinogen count of 1.5 g/l (Ref. range: 2–4.5 g/l). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the patient had antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes.\n\n【16】Computed tomography (CT) of head revealed no abnormality, while CT of venogram showed an apparent filling defect extending within the right sigmoid sinus concerning of venous sinus thrombosis with the possibility of arachnoid granulation. Additionally, there were features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with stenosis of the transverse sinuses bilaterally.\n\n【17】Due to the high suspicion of VITT, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was commenced at 1 g/kg with a second dose at 0.5 mg/kg and combined with oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg. Fondaparinux of 2.5 mg OD was started.\n\n【18】She underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head and venogram to confirm the CT findings. The initial report concluded that the filling defect noted on CT in the right sigmoid sinus was likely a slight granulation rather than thrombus. However, in view of the clinical suspicion of VITT, a second opinion was sought and the MRV was reported as suggestive of a small-volume venous sinus thrombosis . Fondaparinux was increased to 7.5 mg OD.\n\n【19】Due to the rarity of this complication, her case was discussed with a tertiary centre who advised to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【20】CTPA confirmed a right-sided subsegmental pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of mesenteric or portal venous thrombosis. Concurrently, she underwent a ultrasound doppler of her right leg due to swelling, which ruled out a deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【21】Platelet levels began to improve significantly after the second dose of IVIG  and her symptoms improved. Fondaparinux was continued (4 days total) until discharge.\n\n【22】She was then started on apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 1 week, which was reduced to 5 mg twice daily, and on a prednisolone weaning regimen. Weekly blood tests showed her platelet counts remained within normal limits and her d-dimer had normalized (d-dimer levels of 23 704–376 after 21 days between 13 April and 11 May). She remains on long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】This report describes a case of VITT post-administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine in a 55-year-old woman with no history or risk factors for VTE.\n\n【25】This case, as well as other reported incidences, appear to be specific for vaccination. A study in Norway reported that after 132 686 first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were administered, five patients were admitted to hospital after 7–10 days after receiving the dose with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. All five patients had significantly high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies to PF4 and platelet activation, with no prior exposure to heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The association between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the risk of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events was also assessed in a study using patient level data for ~29 million people vaccinated in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. An increased risk of thrombocytopenia after the AstraZeneca vaccine and increased risk of VTE and CVST were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The features in these cases share similarities with heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT). In HITT, platelet-activating antibodies develop after exposure to heparin, which leads to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In VITT, it is suspected that cationic PF4 becomes bound with an anionic molecule produced by the cells at the vaccination site or in the vaccine, which then induces antibody formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These antibodies then bind to platelets via the Fc gamma RIIA receptors which leads to platelet activation, as in HITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The thrombosis progresses rapidly and has a high disposition at unusual sites, including CVST or the hepatic or portal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In previous cases, patients had also presented with DVT, arterial thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In previous reports of VITT, few patients had a history of thromboembolic events as seen in our case where the patient had no risk factors for VTE and had a low-risk status. Importantly, almost all patients had significant levels of PF4 antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically, the main features seen in these patients present 5–30 days after vaccination and include thrombocytopaenia, thrombosis and raised d-dimer levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current diagnostic criteria categorizes patients into unlikely, possible, probable and definite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Anticoagulation is currently the first treatment in probable or definite cases of VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. IVIG is also used as immunosuppression. After administration, platelet counts rise, and markers of hypercoagulability improve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that serial blood samples obtained in VITT patients before and after two/three doses of IVIG have demonstrated reversion to a weaker or negative PF4-enhanced SRA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Observational data support the concept that high-dose IVIG is effective in VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Corticosteroids may be used if IVIG is not available; similar to the management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where corticosteroids are believed to raise the platelet count by decreasing clearance of antibody-coated platelets by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Platelet transfusion was avoided due to the risk of progression of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dose therapy effects in our case was evidenced by improving d-dimer, platelets and fibrinogen.\n\n【32】This case highlights the importance of liaising across specialist centres, which, in our case, advised further imaging to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【33】Ultimately, this case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, management and monitoring. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of VITT after vaccination. As patients with CVST and/or thrombosis due to VITT can become acutely unwell despite initially appearing to be stable, close monitoring is essential.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr Rebecca Spendiff, Colchester general hospital, for providing imaging.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained by the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Saad (SA) Ahmed—Acute Medicine, Colchester Hospital, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Turner Rd, Colchester CO4 5JL, UK.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:07:58", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:04", "cost": 6.56}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:07:56"}

Dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of TIVAP. The etiologies described in the literature include venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter obstruction, catheter disruption or dislocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Herein, we report the rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to catheter migration into the pleural space.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man presented to the vascular surgical outpatient clinic with TIVAP dysfunction. He received TIVAP (8-Fr Polysite silicone catheter in 2018, Perouse Medical, Ivry-Le-Temple, France.) implantation more than 3 years ago. He had received monthly 80 mg intravenous docetaxel treatment for left lung squamous cell carcinoma after the TIVAP implantation. As patient’s statement, he has dry cough before diagnosed of lung squamous cell carcinoma and persistent during the course of chemotherapy. Obstruction of the device occurred during blood aspiration though a smooth intravenous push was reported by nursing staff in the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea had developed hours after infusion of chemotherapeutic agents in the past 6 months. On examination, the port was well fixed, with a fair depth of puncture. Migration of the catheter tip was found by plain film check-up , compared with the image obtained 6 months ago. Chest computed tomography revealed that the catheter migrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space . Catheter removal with SVC repair via sternotomy or endovascular stent graft coverage with adequate pericardial drainage was advised, but the patient chose conservative treatment for the migrated device. Oral Vinorelbine 100 mg twice per month was initiated after a discussion with the primary care oncologist.

Etiology includes intra-catheter thrombosis or precipitation, fibrin sheath formation or venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter kinking, pinch-off syndrome and catheter migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The incidence of spontaneous catheter migration ranges from 0.4 to 2% based on a review of the available literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In this case, the migrated catheter penetrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space, which is a rare clinical situation.\n\n【10】We postulate that the mechanism of catheter migration may be related to an elevated intra-thoracic cavity due to cough, which is especially frequent in patients with lung cancer, as described by Wu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Shallow catheter tip location, which is defined as a catheter tip located above the lower third of SVC, and lung cancer were assumed to be risk factors for catheter migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Here, the migrated catheter tip was directed towards the post-chemotherapy fibrotic SVC wall, with a combination of radial force caused by the angulating catheter itself, and the kinetic movement of the heartbeat resulting in penetration of the vessel wall into pleural space.\n\n【11】Chou _et al_ . reported a case of innominate vein penetration into the pleural space by a left-sided silicone TIVAP catheter 4 months after implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient had left-side massive pleural effusion after fluid infusion via TIVAP. In our patient, the catheter migrated into the right pleural space via the pericardial space, as shown by CT, which would explain his discomfort after chemotherapy. Over-the-wire catheter exchange or direct catheter removal are the treatment choice for the obstructed TIVAP. However, any intervention affecting the dysfunctional catheter, including removal or exchange may lead to possible lethal hemothorax or hemopericardium without proper closure of the chronic tract, which had been reported in previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Leaving the TIVAP without further utilization did not cause any adverse effect; therefore, this option was also provided. After understanding the treatment options, their risks and benefits, and considering his preferences, goals and beliefs, he did not want to undergo more invasive interventions, due to his old age and advanced cancer status. This decision was made according to the current shared decision making procedure.\n\n【12】In conclusion, extra-vascular migration of the catheter is a rare but important etiology of TIVAP malfunction. Physicians and surgeons should be aware of this risk when inserting a TIVAP as well as the way to prevent it, i.e. catheter tip check before usage or replacement.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank the primary care physician Dr Chin-Teng Yu for detailed case information sharing and the department chief Dr Sheng-Yueh Yu for general support.

Her ECG showed a PR interval of 160 ms in lead II, and a delta wave pattern in leads V2 and V3, with a normal QRS interval of 100 ms. We analyzed the three criteria for confirmation of minimal pre-excitation: (i) absence of a Q wave in V6; (ii) presence of an R wave in V1 and (iii) absence of an R wave in avR. The 3 criteria were not met and failed to establish a diagnosis of ventricular pre-excitation. The electrophysiological study confirmed the presence of a left accessory pathway. A new criterion was analyzed: the variation of the PR interval on the same ECG. A difference of >30 ms was successful to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway before ablation and its absence after catheter ablation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The classic ECG criteria for pre-excitation syndrome includes: (i) a short PR interval <120 ms, (ii) the presence of a delta wave (slurring of the initial portion of the QRS interval) and (iii) an increased QRS duration of >110 ms When there is minimal pre-excitation on a 12-lead ECG, the diagnosis of ventricular pre-excitation can be challenging. There are another three criteria to confirm or exclude the presence of an accessory pathway, which include: (i) absence of a Q wave in lead V6, (ii) presence of an R wave in lead V1 and (iii) absence of an R wave in lead avR. In the following patient we studied the three criteria which failed to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway, although the electrophysiological study found a left lateral accessory pathway with orthodromic reentrant tachycardia. We thus analyzed another criterion for the differential diagnosis: the variation of the PR interval which is the difference of the longest PR interval and the shortest PR interval of the 12-lead ECG.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 14-year-old female patient was hospitalized in our Cardiology Department for repeated episodes of PSVT which started at the age of 11. She was treated with Bisoprolol 2,5 mg but presented PSVT despite antiarrhythmic drugs. The 12-lead ECG showed minimal pre-excitation, with a small delta wave in leads V2–V3 but with a normal QRS complex of 100 ms and a normal PR interval in lead II of 160 ms. The three classical criteria for confirmation/exclusion of an accessory pathway were analyzed: there was a Q wave in lead V6, the precordial transition was after lead V1 and a R wave was present in lead avR. Therefore, the three criteria failed to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway. We measured the longest and the shortest PR interval and found a difference of 40 ms between leads II and V2.  Before the electrophysiological study, an echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and normal dimensions for the cardiac chambers, without any valvulopathy . During electrophysiological study 4 catheters were introduced through the right femoral vein: a quadripolar catheter at the level of the high right atrium, a quadripolar catheter at the level of the His bundle, a decapolar catheter at the level of the coronary sinus and the ablation catheter at the level of the right ventricle. During ventricular stimulation the retrograde conduction was through a left lateral accessory pathway, which was further confirmed by the activation through the coronary sinus catheter . As the accessory pathway was lateral, a trans-septal approach was performed using the Brockenborg needle for the septal puncture .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7:|删除段之间换行|Before adenosine injection there is a small wave at the beginning of the QRS interval, which should be differentiated from a delta wave.

Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway was performed using 35 W and 55 C. After ablation there was no anterograde or retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway. After 30 min the procedure was stopped and the patient returned to her room. The 12-lead ECG performed after catheter ablation was compared with the ECG before ablation and the three classical criteria were once again insufficient to establish the presence or absence of an accessory pathway.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Fluoroscopic image during catheter ablation of the left lateral accessory pathway.

The characteristic ECG elements for this syndrome are: (i) the presence of a short PR interval, (ii) the presence of the delta wave (with slurring of initial portion of the QRS) and (iii) the prolongation of the QRS complex >110 ms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Cases with a normal PR interval are possible in patients with accessory pathways. This may occur due to the presence of a long Kent bundle, localized on the left side with delayed atrial conduction. The PR interval might be at the lower limit of normality (120–130 ms). In our case, the accessory pathway was localized in the far lateral mitral ring.\n\n【18】Diagnostic problems occur when the PR interval is <120 ms, the delta wave is barely visible and the QRS complex is not more than 110 ms. As a solution to this limitation, Bogun _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> claimed that the absence of a septal Q wave in V6 is an indirect sign of pre-excitation. In their study on 37 patients with minimal pre-excitation, while none of the patients presented a septal Q wave prior to treatment, 80% of them recovered it after ablation.\n\n【19】ECG is a non-invasive tool to determining the general location of an accessory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Studies report that patients with left-sided accessory pathways present counterclockwise rotation of QRS transitional zone, more specifically, in lead V1 or prior to that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In their early classification of type A or B pre-excitation, Rosenbaum _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> identified a direct correlation between the presence of left-sided pathways and early horizontal transition in precordial leads. This claim is strengthened by the fact that left free wall pathways cause an earlier activation of the left ventricle, thus generating a right bundle branch block pattern. In the study of Eisenberger _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> on 238 WPW patients, 7% presented a septal R wave in lead avR prior to ablation, and 71% post-treatment. Absence of the R wave in lead avR has a good sensibility for the presence of an accessory pathway.\n\n【20】In unclear cases with minimal pre-excitation, another tool for the ECG diagnosis is the difference between the longest and the shortest PR interval on the same ECG reading. A difference of more than 30 ms in our case was successful in confirming the presence of the accessory pathway before ablation, and excluding it after successful treatment.\n\n【21】The use of a selective AV nodal blocking agent (such as adenosine) can non-invasively confirm or exclude a pre-excitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, 1 day after catheter ablation, the adenosine test revealed a 2:1 AV block that persisted for 6 s after injection. By this test we confirmed the absence of an accessory pathway before the discharge of the patient.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written patient consent to publish has been received; please find the attached consent.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cismaru Gabriel-Laurentiu.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:21", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:31", "cost": 10.084}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:21"}

We report a case of fetal chylous ascites without anemia, resulting in abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia and flabby skin. At 17 weeks of gestation, fetal ascites was first detected and deteriorated without anemia. At 28, 33 and 36 weeks of gestation, paracentesis was performed three times because of cardiovascular impairment, confirming chylous ascites.

He did not harbor known mutations as a cause of a genetic disease, which resulted in difficulties of keeping a sitting posture until 10 months of age. This case demonstrates the possibility that fetal persistent ascites without anemia _in utero_ might be related to the congenital abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Physical examination of the newborn at birth, showing abdominal skin wrinkles ( **a** ) and bilateral abdominal wall projection ( **b** ).</u>\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 39-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, was referred to our hospital at 13 weeks of gestation because of positive anti-M antibody at the serological screening test. Although no abnormal finding was found on ultrasound examination (US) at the initial visit, fetal left hydrothorax was detected at 15 weeks and ascites at 17 weeks. Maternal serological tests for parvovirus B19 (PB19), cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella and syphilis were negative, and amniocentesis confirmed a normal karyotype denoted as 46 XY. Although fetal hydrothorax spontaneously regressed from 19 weeks and completely disappeared at 21 weeks, fetal ascites deteriorated, and fetal echo revealed holosystolic tricuspid valve regurgitation at 21 weeks. At 27 weeks of gestation, reverse flow in the ductus venosus and increased preload index in the inferior vena cava without an elevated peak systolic velocity of the middle cerebral artery occurred, suggesting cardiovascular impairment. At 28 weeks of gestation, paracentesis was performed to improve the fetal cardiovascular impairment, and fetal ascitic fluid contained 92% lymphocytes, deducing chylous origin. A second paracentesis was also performed at 33 weeks for the same reason. However, fetal ascites increased again, and maternal abdominal distension with polyhydramnios worsened. Therefore, elective cesarean section was performed due to previous cesarean section at 36 0/7 weeks of gestation along with the third paracentesis in order for the baby to be delivered easier.\n\n【8】A male infant weighing 3488 g with a symmetrically enlarged lateral abdomen associated with abdominal skin folds and cryptorchidism was delivered . Total parenteral nutrition was introduced, and intravenous administration of octreotide was initiated since Day 6, followed by a low-fat formula diet containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) from Day 15. Octreotide was terminated on Day 36, and breast feeding was started on Day 59. US and computed tomography showed worsened ascites after increasing breast feeding; therefore, breast feeding was switched to low-fat formula containing MCT diet on Day 77. The ascites decreased, and the baby was discharged on Day 92. The baby started rehabilitation to improve his abdominal muscle strength and movement. At 10 months of age, he had difficulty keeping a sitting posture, although neurological findings were normal. At 11 months of age, magnetic resonance imaging showed an oblique and transverse abdominal muscle hypoplasia . Next, orchiopexy was performed at 12 months of age, and we confirmed that his oblique and transverse muscles are very thin and vulnerable.

Embryological studies suggest that diastasis recti abdominis would occur due to disruptive phenomena before the fusion of myotomes during the 8 weeks of gestation, whereas muscular hypoplasia should arise from the later phenomena 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only four case reports of abdominal muscle hypoplasia associated with fetal ascites have been published in English language 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. One of them had ascites from 22 weeks due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), whereas the others manifested ascites from 20 to 22 weeks due to PB19 infection. All of them showed lateral abdominal bulging at birth, having hypoplastic oblique and transverse abdominal muscles with normal recti abdominis. Travan _et al_ . supposed that muscle hypoplasia is not only attributed to mechanical compression with vascular compromise inducing ischemia due to fetal ascites but also to fetal anemia caused by TTTS and PB19 infections, which provoke tissue hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Note that our case had chylous ascites from 17 weeks without anemia; therefore, its pathogenesis is different from the four previously reported cases. Several genetic disorders, such as prune belly syndrome (PBS), are supposedly caused by abdominal muscle defects, and PBS is characterized by laxity of the abdominal wall musculature, bilateral cryptorchidism and urinary tract anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our case did not present uropathy during the prenatal and postnatal periods, suggesting it was different from PBS.\n\n【12】Congenital chylothorax and chylous ascites could occur during fetal life due to lymph leakage into the pleural and/or peritoneal cavities, and their causes include inappropriate chyle transport toward the main circulation because of aplasia, hypoplasia, obstruction or thoracic duct severance; they are idiopathic in numerous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, spontaneous regression of primary fetal hydrothorax commonly occurs in 9–22% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, whereas only one report described a case of fetal chylous ascites that spontaneously regressed before birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this case, cytological examination of the fetal peritoneal fluid revealed chylous ascites. Therefore, the hydrothorax might be chylothorax; however, although chylothorax regressed during pregnancy, fetal chylous ascites occurred and persisted throughout pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on such a case, although the etiology remains unclear.\n\n【13】In conclusion, our case demonstrates that persistent fetal ascites from the early second trimester without anemia could be associated with congenital abdominal wall muscle hypoplasia.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no source of funding.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Shunsuke Tamaru.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:16:37", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:17:02", "cost": 25.356}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:17:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:16:35"}

Capillary Blood Glucose was 29 mmol/L. HbA1c was 133 mmol/L. Non-contrast computerised tomography (CT) scan of the brain was normal suggesting that the cause of her seizure was hyperglycaemia. However, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed infarcts in the left paracentral lobule and caudate nucleus.

This was later confirmed on CT angiogram. This case demonstrates how the initial CT Head was non-diagnostic. We stress the importance of taking a careful seizure history and subsequently obtaining an MRI scan to fully exclude structural pathology.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The annual incidence of carotid artery dissection is approximately 2.5–3 per 100 000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Causes are either traumatic or atraumatic. Presentation can include seizures, headaches or even focal neurological deficits which can become permanent due to prolonged ischaemia causing cerebral infarcts. We report the case of a 36-year-old Type 2 diabetic woman, initially thought to have had a hyperglycaemic seizure, who instead had cerebral infarcts secondary to a left ICA dissection which was likely the true cause of her seizure. We stress the importance of taking a careful history of the seizure and we caution against the reliance on a CT scan to exclude structural pathology.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a witnessed seizure which resulted in loss of consciousness. In particular, she described shaking of the right hand which progressed sequentially to involve the right arm and then the right leg. She then lost consciousness for approximately 2–3 minutes after which she regained consciousness but remained drowsy. In the preceding 48 hours, she reported that she had two episodes of shaking in her right hand. These lasted approximately 2–3 minutes and resolved spontaneously. She had no previous seizure history. On examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15 and she had no neurological deficits as a result of the seizure. She had a 21 year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus which was managed with oral hypoglycaemic drugs. She had no other significant medical history. Her capillary blood glucose level was 29 mmol/L and her HbA1c level was 133 mmol/L. Her HbA1c had ranged between 114 and 144 mmol/L over the last 6 years indicating poor glycaemic control. Her remaining blood tests were normal. Apart from the patient’s ethnicity (South East Asian) and diabetic status there were no other cardiovascular risk factors for a stroke. A non-contrast CT scan of her brain was normal. A lumbar puncture ruled out intracranial infection as it showed mildly raised cerebrospinal fluid glucose and protein levels. At this point, it was felt that hyperglycaemia was the most likely cause for her seizure. Accordingly, her glycaemic control was optimised and preparations for discharge were made.\n\n【6】Nonetheless, an MRI scan of the brain was organised to definitively exclude structural pathology. This MRI showed that the patient had a subacute infarction of her left paracentral lobule as well as an infarction of the head of her left caudate nucleus. In addition, the MRI also showed that she had loss of the normal vascular flow void of the intracranial segment of the left ICA raising the suspicion of thrombosis of the vessel secondary to a dissection. Consequently, a CT angiogram was arranged and it confirmed near complete dissection of the left ICA. This pathology is depicted in Figs 1 – 5 .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Images A and B are coronal views of the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence of the brain.

The derived CT angiogram demonstrated reduced filling in the left ICA. There was preservation of flow in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and left anterior cerebral artery (ACA), possibly due to adequate interhemispheric flow via the anterior communicating artery . She underwent further blood tests for anti-nuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-immunoglobulin G antibody anti-cardiolipin antibodies, all of which were negative. As part of a wider serological work-up, she also had negative results for lyme serology, hepatitis serology, human immunodeficiency virus, treponema pallidum and paraneoplastic antibodies. She was then started on anti-epileptic and anticoagulation therapy as management. She was reviewed via telephone 9 months later, at which point, she reported no further seizures or any other residual symptoms.

Moreover, ICA dissection is known to account for approximately 20% of stokes that occur in patients under 45 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. Collectively, these results stress the importance of ruling out other causes of focal-onset seizures such as ICA dissection when assessing a patient presenting with a new focal onset seizure even the context of convincing factors such as hyperglycaemia. The involuntary shaking of the right hand followed by sequential progression of seizure activity to the entire right body suggested that the focus of her seizure was the left primary motor cortex. This is well correlated with infarction in her left paracentral lobule given its anatomical proximity to left primary motor cortex. We felt that the left caudate nucleus infarction was likely secondary to seizure activity for two reasons. Firstly, it was of a lower hyperintensity as compared with the infarction in the left paracentral lobule. Secondly, the anatomical location of the left caudate nucleus infarction did not correlate as well with the clinical description of the seizure.\n\n【17】This case also demonstrates how it is insufficient to rely on CT to exclude structural pathology. Recent studies have revealed that CT failed to detect abnormalities which were detected on MRI in 26–57% of cases of a newly presenting seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guideline \\[CG137\\] section 1.6.21 states that MRI \\`is particularly important' in any patient with a seizure who has \\`any suggestion of a focal onset on history, examination or \\[electroencephalogram\\] (unless clear evidence of benign focal epilepsy)’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This case serves as a rationale behind the existence of such guidelines and provides some context in which these guidelines should be interpreted. In conclusion, we stress the importance of taking a careful history when evaluating a patient presenting with a new focal-onset seizure and we advise clinicians to always rule out other causes of seizures even in the context of convincing factors.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has provided written consent for publication of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Anmol Pandey.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:04", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:08", "cost": 4.441}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:59:53"}

The neutrophil count before initiation of pembrolizumab administration was 5432/μL. The absolute neutrophil count was 68/μL, however, hemoglobin and platelet levels were within normal limits in peripheral blood. He was treated with meropenem 1g three times daily for 9 days, vancomycin 1g twice daily for 6 days and micafungin 150 mg once daily for 5 days. He underwent a bone marrow puncture. The pathological findings revealed a decrease of mature neutrophils without abnormal levels of other types of blood cells and dysplasia of the bone marrow . Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections were not observed. His titer of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was 1:40 by a fluorescent antibody method before pembrolizumab administration. He did not receive any medicine other than pembrolizumab. Anti-neutrophil antibody was detected in peripheral blood after the treatment with pembrolizumab. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with agranulocytosis associated with pembrolizumab treatment. On the fifth hospital day, we began to administer filgrastim 75 μg/body for 4 days.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin–eosin staining of bone marrow aspiration clot revealed a decrease of mature neutrophils but normal levels of other types of blood cells (scale bars 50 μm)</u>\n\n【10】Chest CT scans on admission showed a consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung . A sputum culture did not reveal causative bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi in the infection. A blood culture was negative.

A pathological examination of transbronchial lung biopsy tissue from the right middle lobe revealed organizing pneumonia showing intraluminal polypoid fibrosis in alveoli . The consolidation in the right lower lung field, seen on chest X-ray, did not improve in spite of empiric systemic antibacterial therapy. We diagnosed ILD induced by pembrolizumab. He had no symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or chest pain. We evaluated the condition as grade 1 of immune-related pneumonitis without any medication.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Chest CT scan images obtained after two cycles of pembrolizumab.

We discontinued G-CSF administration. The neutrophil count remained within normal limits without G-CSF administration . The patient was discharged from our hospital 15 days after admission.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|The clinical course in this patient (WBC, white blood cell count; Neu, neutrophil count)</u>\n\n【14】Seven days after discharge, he presented in our hospital with diplopia, although his neutrophil count was normal and ILD was not getting worse. He did not have ocular symptoms before the initiation of pembrolizumab. No other muscle symptoms were found. The other neurological examination was unremarkable. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs) were positive. He was diagnosed with ocular MG associated with pembrolizumab treatment and was treated with pyridostigmine 60mg three times a day.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】In this report, we have presented a patient with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma who had agranulocytosis, ILD and ocular MG induced by pembrolizumab. No other case of pembrolizumab-caused agranuloytosis could be found in a review of the literature.\n\n【17】ICI often produce good responses and have lead to durable responses in patients with various types of cancer, including NSCLC. Pembrolizumab prolonged progression free survival and overall survival over that obtained by chemotherapy in untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The prognosis for pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma is unfavorable, and a standard therapy has not been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recent studies reported that 70.5–90.2% of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinomas showed high expression levels of PD-L1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors can be expected to be effective in patients with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. In this case, the PD-L1 TPS was 75%, and tumors shrunk clearly after the initiation of pembrolizumab treatment.\n\n【18】IrAEs tend to occur 12–16 weeks after the start of immunotherapy and have been reported in a variety of organs. A recent study suggested that a better response to PD-1 inhibitor therapy was associated with early irAEs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this case, agranulocytosis, ILD and MG developed after 2–3 months, however, the response to pembrolizumab was diagnosed as PR after three cycles of pembrolizumab.\n\n【19】Agranulocytosis is a rare clinical finding, and the incidence of agranulocytosis was reported to be in several cases per million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Drug-induced agranulocytosis tends to appear within 1 year, and the mortality was reported to be 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. G-CSF was reported to be effective for agranulocytosis when administered together with antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To date, several cases of agranulocytosis caused by ICI have been reported. Nivolumab-induced agranulocytosis was reported after one to nine cycles of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Ipilimumab-induced agranulocytosis was reported after four cycles of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Although the standard treatment of agranulocytosis caused by immunotherapy has not been established, previous reports have shown that G-CSF, intravenous immunoglobulin and high doses of steroid were effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 9 \\]</u>. In this case, viral infections and connective tissue diseases were ruled out by a blood test and physical examination. The patient did not take any other drug than pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab was considered to be the cause of agranulocytosis according to the findings in the bone marrow aspiration. The neutrophil count increased and remained within normal limits after G-CSF administration. A recent study demonstrated that drug-induced agranulocytosis was induced not only by direct drug toxicity to bone marrow precursors but also by an immune-mediated mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the mechanism of pembrolizumab-induced agranulocytosis has not been clarified yet.\n\n【20】Several irAEs can be present simultaneously in different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Thus, this patient was affected by agranulocytosis, ILD and ocular MG. The incidence of any-grade ILD by pembrolizumab was reported to be 5.8%, and ILD of grade 3 or 4 was reported to be 2.6% in a recent clinical trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A recent study showed that MG, including generalized MG and ocular MG induced by an ICI, was relatively rare, however, MG-specific-related mortality was 30.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The onset of symptoms of MG was reported to occur 2–12 weeks after the initiation of immunotherapy. It is important to detect symptoms and make a diagnosis of MG as soon as possible. However, the incidence and onset of symptoms of ocular MG alone is unknown. As in this case, patients can be affected by many irAEs. If a patient develops one irAE, one should pay attention to the expression of other irAEs.\n\n【21】In conclusion, we treated pulmonary pleomorphic carcinomas with pembrolizumab with good response. We describe here the first reported case of a patient with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma who developed agranulocytosis with anti-neutrophil antibody after pembrolizumab treatment; the patient was found to have ILD and ocular MG. One should watch out for early irAEs if immunotherapy produced a good response. In this patient, agranulocytosis was immediately improved by administration of G-CSF without use of systemic steroids. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of ICI-induced agranulocytosis.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to healthcare professionals who managed this patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Kaoru Kubota, Masahiro Seike and Akihiko Gemma report honoraria from MSD and Taiho Pharmaceutical, outside the submitted work.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received to publish this case report.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from this patient’s family for publication of the study including the patient’s details and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Masahiro Seike.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:53:15", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:56:58", "cost": 223.423}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:56:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:53:13"}

This is the first report to describe a case of HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA that was treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. In this early case, upfront surgery outcomes guided the selection of appropriate systemic therapy. A 31-year-old woman previously diagnosed with FA experienced tumor growth. Core needle biopsy and imaging studies confirmed a diagnosis of stage IIA HER2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with no evidence of lymph node metastasis (cT2N0M0). Breast-conserving surgery was performed. Pathological diagnosis revealed stage IA IDC with a predominant intraductal component (pT1aN0M0), arising from FA. In conclusion, we encountered an extremely rare case of HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA in which pathological infiltration was difficult to predict based on preoperative imaging.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fibroadenoma (FA) is one of the most common benign breast tumors with a peak age of onset between 15 and 35 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Breast cancer rarely arises from FA and is detected only in 0.02–0.125% of FA-related cases, usually in patients over 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, clinical, sonographic and mammographic findings are similar to those of FA alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, thereby complicating cancer detection. There is no consensus on subtypes distribution of this disease, and hormone receptor-positive rates may not differ significantly from common breast cancer (estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 68.8%; progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive, 62.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. However, almost all cases, in which subtypes have been reported are of luminal or triple-negative types, were negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Herein, we report a rare case of HER2-positive early breast cancer arising from FA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old woman presented without any medical or family history of cancer. Approximately, 1 year before her current presentation, a 13-mm-sized left breast mass was detected on breast screening , classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3. The patient was diagnosed with FA based on imaging alone. Follow-up imaging revealed mass enlargement and presence of new calcifications , which prompted core needle biopsy. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was diagnosed, and immunohistochemical staining revealed an HER2 score of 3+ (HER2-positive), without ER or PgR expression. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of axillary lymph nodes suggested no evidence of metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a maximum lesion diameter of 22 mm. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed absence of distant metastasis. Thus, stage IIA HER2-positive IDC (cT2N0M0) was diagnosed. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was considered, upfront breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed based on the patient’s preference. The patient refused genetic testing for hereditary cancers. The excised specimen surface contained a relatively well-circumscribed, grey-white and solid 19-mm tumor . Histologically, this lobulated lesion had predominantly intraductal solid growth patterns of large carcinoma cells with marked coagulation necroses and calcium depositions . Carcinoma cells were polygonal, showing high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and irregular nuclei with distinct nucleoli. Infiltrating elements of histological grade 3, up to 4 mm, were observed in the lesion , with scattered microinvasive foci . On immunohistochemical examination, neoplastic cells were negative for ER and PgR (total Allred scores: 0 and 0, respectively) . The HER2 score was estimated to be 3+ in invasive and intraductal neoplastic cells , and the Ki67 (MIB-1) labeling index was 58.7%. Myoepithelial cells, positive for p63 and CD10, were identified in intraductal components. Based on these pathological findings, an invasive carcinoma of no special type, HER2 immuno-subtype, with a predominant intraductal component, derived from an intracanalicular FA was diagnosed. Since sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed absence of metastasis, the final diagnosis was stage IA IDC (pT1aN0M0). Pathological findings guided selection of weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab as adjuvant systemic therapy. Additionally, the patient underwent radiotherapy of the whole left breast (42.56 Gy) and tumor-bed boost irradiation (10.64 Gy), considering her age. Approximately 6 months following surgery, no apparent recurrence was noted.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Comparison between images of the left breast tumor taken 1 year earlier ( **a** and **b** ) and before the current operation ( **c** and **d** ) (a, c, mammogram (cranio-caudal view); b, d, ultrasonography).

First, breast cancer arising from FA could involve HER2-positive type; thus, chemotherapy with targeted therapy should be considered. Second, upfront surgery may be a useful guide for selecting appropriate systemic therapy.\n\n【11】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe an HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy. We conducted literature searches with PubMed using the keywords ‘fibroadenoma’ and ‘carcinoma’ to collect articles in English published between February 2013 and June 2021; for literature published between January 1986 and January 2013, we referred to the review by Wu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA is extremely rare, with only one reported case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, a somewhat different case of coexistence of HER2-positive breast cancer, phyllodes tumor and FA has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, to date, no cases have mentioned a systemic treatment strategy.\n\n【12】Currently, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy is generally considered for HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. The number of patients receiving NAC has recently increased due to the potential for improving breast preservation rate and achieving pathological complete response with good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, chemotherapy de-escalation is another significant issue. Using non-anthracycline regimens has become a common option for low-risk patients because anthracycline-based regimens could cause cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemotherapy regimen is generally selected by considering the infiltration diameter of the tumor. However, since the histological type of this disease is mainly carcinoma _in situ_ or early invasive breast cancer, it is difficult to base this regimen selection on preoperative imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Wu _et al_ . reported a mean tumor diameter of breast cancer within FA of 2.46 cm. However, 33.3% of cases were pTis, and those with a known infiltration diameter were pT1a or pT1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our case, the actual infiltration diameter was only up to 4 mm (pT1a). However, the imaging-based tumor diameter was 22 mm (cT2). Therefore, upfront surgery could help in guiding the selection of a less intense non-anthracycline regimen. Furthermore, it may be a reasonable choice to avoid chemotherapy altogether.\n\n【14】It should be noted that even tumors with small infiltration diameter (pT1mi or pT1a) may involve lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. FNAC should be performed, if possible, since NAC may be a better approach when lymph node metastasis is detected. In our case, although mild lymphadenopathy was observed, FNAC did not reveal metastasis.\n\n【15】In conclusion, breast cancer arising from FA could present as an HER2-positive type; hence, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy should be considered. Upfront surgery may be useful in guiding selection of an appropriate adjuvant therapy, owing to difficulty in predicting infiltration diameter through preoperative imaging alone. It is unclear how breast cancers arise from FA and why these cases tend to more frequently involve HER2-negative subtype, and further research is required.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors’ COI are not related to this work.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Osaki reports personal fees from AstraZeneca K.K.; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.

On examination he was vitally stable. General physical examination showed multiple skin lesions and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy with the left cervical node measuring 4 × 6 cm in size. Systemic examination was unremarkable. His computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed large infiltrative heterogeneously enhancing mass involving superior anterior and middle mediastinum involving root of aorta and other major vessels with extension of disease encasing trachea, superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, pulmonary trunk and veins . Punch biopsy of the skin was done which showed mild irregular acanthosis and focal parakeratosis representing inflammatory hyperpigmentation which was managed with skin moisturizers. Excisional lymph node biopsy from left cervical area was sent for AFB smear culture, Gene-Xpert for tuberculosis (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) and bacterial culture which were negative. Histopathology showed effaced architecture and infiltration with atypical lymphoid cells showing pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was positive, while it was negative for CD-20 but positive for CD79a, PAX-5 which are other B cell markers .\n\n【6】Considering diagnosis of CD20 negative DLBCL further work up including CD138 for possible plasmablastic variant, ALK protein, EBV, CD30 and HHV 8 was performed for other differential diagnosis, which were negative . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was also negative. Considering the diagnosis of primary CD20 negative DLBCL, which is a high-grade lymphoma, we started him on infusion chemotherapy regimen i.e. EPOCH (Etoposide, Prednisolone, Doxorubicin, vincristine along with bolus of cyclophosphamide). His follow-up interim scan done after four cycles of EPOCH did not show any change in the disease status (treatment failure). Subsequently he was started on second-line chemotherapy i.e. GCD (Gemcitabine, Cisplatin and Dexamethasone) and after two cycles his interim PET-CT scan showed partial remission. We are now planning for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) once he achieved response on two more cycles of GCD.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CT chest with contrast showing large heterogeneous mass.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|(A), (B) and (C) showing Lymph node biopsy HE at 20-X and 40-X show effaced architecture by group of atypical lymphocytes.

They constitute 1–3% of all B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. CD20 is a pan B-cell marker and cells can still survive even after loss of CD20 expression in CD20 negative DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Known subtypes include plasmablastic lymphomas (PBL), primary effusion lymphomas (PEL), anaplastic kinase positive large B-cell lymphomas (ALK+ve LBCL) and large B-cell lymphomas arising in human herpes virus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8 MCD-LBCL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The most prevalent and well-known sub-type is PBL, which accounts for 75% of the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both HIV-positive and -negative patients have been found to have primary CD20 loss in DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pathologically, CD20 negative DLBCL is more closely associated with aggressive pathologic parameters with a high proliferation index and a higher proportion of non-GCB type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only a few cases of well-established sub-types of CD-20 negative DLBCL have been reported that could not be categorized as known variants of CD20 negative DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Here, we present the case of a young male who was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis causing cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, successfully treated with diltiazem, propranolol, methimazole, potassium iodine (SSK) and rivaroxaban.\n\n【2】atrial flutterthyrotoxic periodic paralysisGraves’ disease\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Periodic paralysis is a rare muscle disease that manifests by painless muscle weakness often precipitated by heavy exercise, fasting or high-carbohydrate meals. It is classified as either hyperkalemic or hypokalemic, with the hypokalemic form being most associated with thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation but has less frequently been reported to induce atrial flutter.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 38-year-old Caucasian male with a history of essential hypertension on amlodipine presented to the hospital complaining of recent onset intermittent lower extremity weakness and palpitations. On examination, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 180 bpm, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 rpm, and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 167/92 mmHg. Neurologic exam revealed paraparesis with lower extremity strength of muscle power assessment (MRC) score 3/5. Initial laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia at 1.7 mEq/L (normal 3.4–5 mEq/L), and the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response . He was initially treated with oral metoprolol tartrate and oral diltiazem, but subsequently required initiation of a diltiazem drip at a rate of 15 mg/h. Thyroid laboratory workup revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.008 mU/L (normal 0.35–5.0 mU/L), free T4 level > 8 ng/dL (normal 0.8–1.5 ng/dL) and total T3 of 5.23 ng/mL (normal 0.6–1.81 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) based on the thyroid panel results, hypokalemia and clinical presentation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|12-lead ECG showed a rapid typical cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter and a rapid ventricular rate. Counterclockwise atrial flutter with flutter waves negative in II, III, aVF and positive waves in V1</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Mechanism of TTP</u>\n\n【9】Based on these findings, propylthiouracil 200 mg every 4 h, prednisone 20 mg twice a day, and SSKI every 6 h were prescribed to manage the thyrotoxic state along with propranolol 160 mg every 8 h for additional reduction of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Moreover, therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was initiated regardless of a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points as the flutter was deemed to be induced by the thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【10】A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, revealing a normal left ventricle ejection fraction of 55% and no evidence of significant structural heart disease. Subsequent endocrine workup revealed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) elevated to 33.4 mU/L (normal 0.4–4.0 mU/L) consistent with the diagnosis of Graves’ disease (GD). Patient recovered normal neurological function with MRC 5/5 after 6 h of treatment initiation.\n\n【11】Therapeutic modalities that included radioactive iodine and surgery were discussed and deferred for the future. SSKI was discontinued after one week of treatment, and he was discharged and advised to continue methimazole for the following 12 months. He spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm 2 weeks after medical discharge without the need for electrical or pharmacological cardioversion after maintaining an adequate control of his hyperthyroidism.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Thyrotoxicosis is most associated with atrial fibrillation since thyroid hormone is known to have arrhythmogenic activity by acting on nuclear thyroid receptors and increasing sympathetic activity. Thyroid hormone upregulates the transcription of cardiac proteins, when acting on nuclear thyroid receptors. Thyroid hormones also exert an upregulating effect on the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to calcium release and a positive chronotropic/inotropic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most cases relating thyrotoxicosis to tachyarrhythmias usually refer to atrial fibrillation, but sustained atrial flutter rarely occur in these scenarios.\n\n【14】GD, known as the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroidal and extrathyroidal manifestations. Graves’ is caused by the formation of activating thyrotropin-receptor antibodies that induce thyroid hormone overproduction. Exacerbation of GD may lead to thyroid storm, a potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency, as well as TPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. TPP is another severe but rare complication with a reported incidence of 0.2% in North America and seen more frequently in males and Asians. It is characterized by muscle paralysis, and acute hypokalemia due to a potassium shift into muscle cells . Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is the variant most seen in patients with GD in association with acute thyrotoxicosis, TTP is a sporadic form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The most common arrhythmias related to TPP and HPP are sinus tachycardia, and first-degree atrioventricular block. However, atrial flutter has not previously been illustrated along these clinical scenarios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】When treating HPP, the goal is to address the symptoms caused by a hyperthyroid state and prevent recurrent attacks by controlling possible inducing factors. Despite the nomenclature, potassium reserves are normal in these patients. Supplementation is done to secure normal plasma levels of potassium. Intravenous potassium chloride is the first line of treatment for HPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In cases that proved resistant to this intervention, intravenous propranolol effectively managed the paralytic symptoms. The effectiveness of propranolol can be attributed to its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Antithyroid drug management is widely considered as the gold standard of therapy; however, radioiodine ablation is more prevalent as first-line in North America. Nevertheless, the underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Addressing the rhythm disorder can be divided into two steps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The first is managing rate control, which can be achieved using beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or amiodarone. The comorbidities should be considered when deciding on the agent to use. Propranolol has the advantage of reducing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution since they affect peripheral resistance, and patients with thyrotoxicosis already present with a low systemic vascular resistance.\n\n【18】Amiodarone can be considered since it has a double advantage by reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis due to its high iodine content, and exerting its antiarrhythmic properties by blocking potassium rectifying currents leading to an increase in action potential duration and a prolonged effective refractory period of the AV node 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The combination of properties can result in a more rapid resolution of symptoms in patients with arrhythmia secondary to thyrotoxicosis. On the other hand, amiodarone is rich in iodine and theoretically it may enhance thyrotoxicosis and type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more frequent in patients with underlying thyroid diseases such as GD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thioamides should be given 1 h before SSKI or amiodarone. The second step to consider is preventing the arrhythmia’s maintenance, which can be achieved with the long-term use of the agents discussed above as prophylaxis for recurrent attacks. In this case, propranolol would be the agent of choice.\n\n【19】Lastly, we decided to use prophylactic anticoagulation regardless a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points based on disagreement in the medical literature regarding the effectiveness of this strategy in patients with unknown duration of hyperthyroidism states, even more when transesophageal echocardiography is not pursued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】GD may lead to potentially life-threatening emergencies, such as thyroid storm or TPP. Cardiac testing is indicated in patients with thyrotoxicosis. The underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated accordingly. Propranolol is the beta-blocker of choice in cases of thyrotoxicosis. TPP can be a trigger for the development of sustained atrial flutter. In our case, appropriate treatment was associated with spontaneous resolution of the atrial flutter without the need for cardioversion or ablative intervention.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no relevant acknowledgment.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OR FUNDING\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This project was not supported by any grant or funding agencies.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This is a case report, IRB was not required.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient agreed with publication.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to manuscript writing and approved the final version.

The mother was in good health during pregnancy and did not receive any teratogenic drugs or radiation. The parents were double third-degree relatives, which denoted a strong parental consanguinity. The baby had no respiration and cry at birth with an Apgar score of 4/10 and 6/10 at the first and fifth minutes of life, respectively. He was referred to our department at 12 hours of life because of respiratory difficulty and a suspected diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. On arrival, he had fever, sucking failure, grunting and less movement. On physical examination, there were sluggish primitive reflexes, rectal temperature of 39°C, respiratory rate of 95/min, heart rate of 171/min, subcostal and intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, diminished breathing sound on the left side, and peripheral cyanosis with oxygen saturation of 84%. There were no meconium stained mucus membranes and skin. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 15.8 gm/dl, total leucocyte count of 21 700/mm <sup>3 </sup> (polymorphs 76%, lymphocytes 20%, eosinophils 2% and monocytes 2%), platelet count of 126 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and C-reactive protein of 6 mg/dl. Abnormal clinical findings, leukocytosis and elevated level of C-reactive protein were used for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The chest X-ray showed homogenous opacity on the left lung and hyperlucency of the right lung . Patient was put on intravenous glucose 10% as maintenance fluid, oxygen and antibiotics consisting Cefotaxime and Ampicillin intravenously, during the first and second days. In addition to the mentioned management, we started expressed breast milk by nasogastric tube and added sodium and potassium to the intravenous fluid on the third day. On the fourth day of life, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest showed lack of left lung parenchyma and hyperlucent right lung, as well as existence of pulmonary vasculature , all are diagnostic evidences of left lung aplasia. On the fifth day of life, the Doppler echocardiography revealed a 4-mm patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) . Finally, the patient was diagnosed as a case of left lung aplasia, PDA and neonatal sepsis. Therefore, diuretic therapy, restriction of maintenance fluid, and three doses of oral ibuprofen were recommended as medical care of PDA together with the management of neonatal sepsis. He has been stable since the eighth day of life with good breastfeeding and no need for respiratory support, as well as no changes were observed in the second chest x-ray . The second Doppler echocardiography showed the closure of PDA after three days of the medical management .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A homogeneous opacity on the left lung and hyperlucency of the right lung are visible on the chest X-ray of newborn baby.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The contrast enhanced CT of the thorax shows absence of left lung parenchyma, hyperlucent right lung and evidence of pulmonary vasculature in the index neonate.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|The contrast enhanced CT of the thorax shows absence of left lung parenchyma, hyperlucent right lung and evidence of pulmonary vasculature in the index neonate.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|The Doppler echocardiography of the neonate reveals red colored flow from descending aorta to the left pulmonary artery that shows patent ductus arteriosus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|The second chest x-ray of the neonate shows no change in the homogenous opacity of the left lung.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|After medical management, no evidence of blood flow from descending aorta to left pulmonary artery that shows the closure of patent ductus arteriosus in the Doppler echocardiography of neonate.</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Pulmonary aplasia is a very rare congenital malformation that can be developed unilaterally or bilaterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

PDA is associated with worse respiratory outcomes; therefore, it’s closure lead to respiratory improvement. The medical management consists of diuretic therapy, restriction of maintenance fluid and three doses of oral ibuprofen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. According to the evidences of clinical, laboratory, chest x-ray, thoracic computed tomographic and echocardiographic findings, the index case is left lung aplasia with PDA and neonatal sepsis. Left lung atelectasis due to left bronchus obstruction may be considered in the differential diagnosis. Based on chest CT scan, left bronchus was not obliterated and pathologic causes, including meconium aspiration, mechanical intubation, space occupying lesion of the lung, pleural effusion, pneumothorax and respiratory distress syndrome were not detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. As a result, bronchoscopy was not recommended because bronchial obstruction was unlikely to exist. Up to date, the majority of reported cases of lung agenesis were not accompanied by patent ductus arteriosus and were detected beyond the neonatal period; these are significant distinctions from our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>. The current case report revealed a strong parental consanguinity because they had double third-degree relations. This finding strengthens the genetic basis of the mentioned anomaly, as suggested by Melo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The clinical features of the neonate presented in this case report was respiratory distress and signs of respiratory infection, which are consistent to the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>. In the study of Thomas et al. 50% cases of lung aplasia were accompanied by congenital heart disease, and the prognosis of all four patients was good in the medium term, and there was no regular oxygen requirement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, along with lung aplasia, patent ductus arteriosus was detected initially and was closed after the medical management. The patient had a stable condition on full enteral feeds without any respiratory support after one week of hospitalization. These findings are similar to the study of Thomas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【15】The manifestations of lung aplasia may be observed as early as in the first week of life. Hence, for term neonates with respiratory distress and complete lung opacity on chest x-ray, further imaging is required to evaluate such malformation. The index case of lung aplasia was associated with patent ductus arteriosus and had a strong parental consanguinity. Therefore, in the pathogenesis of pulmonary aplasia, a genetic basis maybe implicated. PDA was closed after the medical management; hence, such care is highly required. As neonatal sepsis accompanied the current case, the proper evaluation and management of infection are suggested for patients with lung aplasia.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We gratefully acknowledge the staffs of neonatal unit of Maiwand Teaching Hospital, particularly Dr. Shorish Haidari and Dr. Basir Rahimzai, for the cooperation in this study.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no known financial conflict of interest or close personal connections that might influence the findings of this study.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The documents used during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by the Department of Neonatology (Protocol no 4 dates 26/9/2022), Kabul University of Medical Sciences.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent to publish the case report was obtained from the patients’ guardians.

On admission, the physical examination found a swollen and multiple bruises on the anterior side of the elbow; its mobilization and palpation were painful with no neurovascular impairment. He reported a fall on the hand: both the hand and elbow were in an extended position. We realized a lateral view X-ray  that showed a displaced fragment above the elbow with no evident fracture on the antero-posterior view .

Given the anterior multiple bruises in the elbow, we performed a transolecranon approach to fix the fractures using two postero-anterior Herbert screws . Postoperatively, the elbow was immobilized in a 90° flexion back splint for 2 weeks. After that, a progressive flexion extension of the elbow was started, which was guided by the physiotherapist. After 6 months, the patient had regained satisfactory motion with no pain.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|3D reconstructed computed tomography of the elbow revealed a comminuted fracture of the capitellum with displaced separate trochlea.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Postoperative radiography showed fixation of the fractures using two Herbert screws with tension band wire fixation of the olecranon.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Trochlear fractures have been rarely reported in the literature, the reason for which they have no clear classification. However, capitellar fractures have many classifications despite their rarity. Bryan and Morrey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> proposed a classification based on three types of capitellar fracture: Type 1 (Hahn–Steinthal) involves the capitellum with an attached subchondral bone; Type 2 (Kocher–Lorenz) involves only the cartilaginous articular surface of the capitellum; Type 3 (Broberg–Morrey) corresponds to a comminuted fracture of the capitellum; and Type 4 added by McKee _et al_ . which includes both the capitellum and a part of the trochlea in one fragment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】On the other hand, the classification of Dubberley _et al._  is comprehensive and allows the inclusion of all varieties of these fractures. It is the only one that indicates the surgical approach based on the fracture type; it takes into account the fracture of both capitellum and trochlea as separate fragments: the Type I fracture include capitellar fracture with or without a part of the lateral trochlear ridge; Type II fracture involves the capitellum and trochlea as one fragment. Type III fracture involves the capitellum and trochlea as two independent fragments. Each type is subdivided to B or A depending on the presence or absence of the posterior condylar comminution, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. According to this last classification, our case belongs to the type III fracture. However, its subdivided entities do not take into consideration the comminution or not of the capitellar fracture. We propose to subdivide the Types III A and III B into subtypes 0 and 1 depending on the absence or presence of comminution of the capitellum, respectively . Thus, our case will be classified exactly as a Type III-A1 fracture according to the Dubberley’s classification.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification.</u>\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification modified\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Dubbrey’s classification modified\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n| Dubberly’s classification . | Subtype:Posterior comminution . | Subtype:Capitellar comminution . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type III | A | 0 |\n| Type III | A | 1 |\n| Type III | B | 0 |\n| Type III | B | 1 |\n\n【21】The exact mechanism of these injuries is still uncertain. However, isolated trochlea fractures (Laugier’s fractures) are suggested to be secondary to indirect trauma following a fall on the outstretched hand in combination with an axial load as the predominant mechanism. Isolated capitellum fractures can occur as a result of compression by the radial head with the elbow in full extension during the injury event or as a result of direct trauma to a highly flexed elbow. In our case, we suggested that the fracture was caused by a complex mechanism that included elbow extension, axial load from the coronoid process to the trochlea, varus stress and radial head compression force on the capitellum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is based on plain radiographs of the injured elbow.

In our case, we elected for an olecranon osteotomy to fix the fractures because of the presence of multiple bruises on the anterior surface of the elbow. This was followed by early mobilization of the elbow, which led to a satisfactory outcome at the last follow-up.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Rachida Guaouguaou for her comments that helped improve the manuscript.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING SOURCE\n--------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient had given his written consent for publication.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The guarantor is Dr Naoufal Elghoul.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:50:00", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:50:19", "cost": 18.907}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:50:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:50:00"}

The protozoa is obliged intracellularly and causes a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes: VL (‘kala azar’), cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (espundia). Kala azar is the most aggressive form and if untreated causes high mortality. Here, we describe a case of VL that presented to us with high-grade fever and found to have Roth spots that were resolved after 15 days of therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus _Leishmania_ . Most cases tend to occur between April and September. The female sandfly specifically feeds at dusk, and tends to remain near its breeding area. Transmission of VL has also been seen by sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, contaminated needles and rarely congenitally. Nearly 50% of VL cases occur in children.\n\n【4】In India, the peak age is between 5 and 9 years and mostly seen in males. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) results in systemic infection of the reticuloendothelial organs and bone marrow. The classical symptoms of VL are high-grade fever, pallor, refusal to feed, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperpigmentation, epistaxis and gingival bleeding. Laboratory tests with classic kala azar usually reveal thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, elevated hepatic transaminase levels and hypoalbuminaemia. The parasite may be detected through direct evidence in the peripheral blood, bone marrow or splenic aspirates.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We report a case of a 7-year-old male child, a resident of Delhi who migrated to Bihar (a state of India) 6 months back, had been resident in Bihar for 1 month only and developed symptoms after 6 months returning to Delhi, presented to us with poor oral intake and high-grade fever for 15 consecutive days. On admission he had pallor and spleno-hepatomegaly.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests gave the following results: haemoglobin 8.5 mg/dl, total leucocyte counts 2990/µl, platelet counts 54 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µl, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 83 U/l, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 85 U/l, serum albumin 3.7 g/dl and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 53 mm/h. Blood culture, tests for malaria and enteric fever were negative. Viral markers and HIV ELISA were also negative. Echocardiography was normal. Fundus by slit-lamp examination revealed _Roth spots_ . The rk39 (recombinant k 39) was negative but in the bone marrow aspiration, intracellular _Leishmani donovani_ bodies were observed.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Slit-lamp examination showing Roth spots.</u>\n\n【9】Therapy with conventional amphotericin B with IV infusion over 4 h was started and child became afebrile after 3 days of therapy. The child was given a total of 15 mg/kg of amphotericin B. No side effect of amphotericin was observed. After completion of therapy, Roth spots were disappeared. 3 months later, he came for follow-up and was found well.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Roth's spots are retinal haemorrhages with white or pale centres composed of coagulated fibrin. They are typically observed via fundoscopy (using an ophthalmoscope) or slit-lamp examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. They are usually caused by immune-complex mediated vasculitis often seen in bacterial endocarditis. Roth's spots may be observed in leukaemia, diabetes, subacute bacterial endocarditis, anaemia, anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, prolonged intubation, preeclampsia, HIV retinopathy, complicated labour and traumatic delivery in mothers and neonates, shaken baby syndrome, intracranial haemorrhage from AV malformation or aneurysm and acute reduction of intraocular pressure following trebeculectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Possible aetiology of Roth spots in our patient could be due to thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Thrombocytopenia can cause haemorrhages in the retina on mucous surfaces and in the skin. Anaemia may cause further anoxic insult to retinal capillaries in patients with kala azar.\n\n【13】Leishmaniasis is endemic in many countries in tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa, Asia, Central and South Americas and Mediterranean regions. Five countries, namely Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil account for 90% of the world incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】VL is a potentially fatal parasitic disease, directly associated with poverty, overcrowding and poor-ventilation. The burden of this disease is also influenced by social factors such as under-nutrition, sanitation, presence of other infectious diseases such as HIV, which delays diagnosis and management. This leads to increased morbidity and mortality due to this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Kala azar is endemic in 52 districts in India, Bihar 通用删除7(英):<u>(31)</u>, Jharkhand 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>, West Bengal 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> and Uttar Pradesh 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>. While both cutaneous and visceral disease occurs in India, Kala azar is by far the most important leishmaniasis in India.\n\n【16】The Aldehyde test remains reliable when testing for surveillance rather than diagnostic purposes. This is due to its relative lack of specificity but high sensitivity at even 3 months post-infection. The new and simple rk39 diagnostic test may be useful screening tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It has a sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100%. Definitive diagnosis is made by demonstration of amastigotes by microscopic examination of materials obtained by bone marrow aspiration or splenic puncture.\n\n【17】The currently used drugs for the treatment of VL are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> sodium stibogluconate, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> amphotericin B, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> miltefosine and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> paromomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Under NVBDCP (National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme) miltefosine as a first-line treatment and amphotericin B as a second-line treatment are used.\n\n【18】Our literature search was unable to find another recorded case of VL with Roth spots in children.

On this occasion, she again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The community frailty response service is composed of an emergency medicine or medicine for older person’s physician and occupational therapist. Between them, they have the ability to carry out medical, functional and cognitive assessments and perform near patient blood testing, portable electrocardiogram, point-of-care ultrasound and administer intravenous medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The service encompasses a catchment area of almost 320 000 people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【6】A nursing home resident, who had a 1-day history of shortness of breath and pyrexia, was referred to the community frailty response service in November 2020. She was also considered by the nursing home staff to be more confused than usual. She had previously tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the 9 September 2021 during an outbreak in the same nursing home, and the virus was confirmed on polymerase chain reaction with a cycle threshold (CT) value of 19.7 on the IDEXX OptiSARS assay.\n\n【7】Initial assessment by the response service noted the resident to be short of breath on exertion and to have a dry cough. Eliciting a detailed history from the resident was limited by her cognition but she denied any other symptoms of focal infection. On examination, her vitals were stable, and she maintained a SpO2 of 96% or higher. There was an audible wheeze throughout both lungs on auscultation. Further examination revealed that the patient had developed delirium. Combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a CT value of 17.9 on the Roche Cobas platform on 25 November 2021. This was 11 weeks after her previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was negative on 30 November 2021 with a value of 0.06 (reference range for negative results < 1.4).\n\n【8】She was treated in the nursing home setting and prescribed medications for symptomatic control only (i.e. paracetamol). An advance care plan was put in place, which prioritized comfort measures. The community frailty response service reviewed her regularly and was available to provide supplemental oxygen, medications and palliative treatment if necessary. Fortunately, her condition began to improve on Day 5 after the onset of her symptoms.\n\n【9】Subsequent whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by the B.1.177 lineage. The first swab sample was not typable; however, variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7 (the alpha variant), had not been detected in surveillance samples in September in Ireland, and we can therefore deduce that the resident had become infected on two occasions with the B.1.177 lineage. A repeat IgG was positive with a value of 9.4 on 22 December 2021, demonstrating some level of immunogenicity after her second infection. The patient was vaccinated with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 19 January 2021 and 15 February 2021 in her nursing home. There have been no further outbreaks after this point.\n\n【10】Of the 51 residents in the nursing home, 39 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during this second outbreak. Four residents were transferred to the acute hospital as their condition deteriorated. Four residents died throughout the course of the outbreak. The remaining residents remained either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms during their clinical course. A number of residents were independently mobile, which posed a threat of further viral transmission due to the presence of increased activity and the presence of exit-seeking behaviours. This risk was mitigated by isolation in single rooms, patient supervision and adherence to infection protection and control guidelines.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, 87% of deaths were in people 65 years and older, though only 13% of infections were in this age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Ireland, at all stages of the national COVID-19 restrictions, older people were required to avoid public transport, to only shop during designated hours and to avoid leaving the house unless necessary in order to limit unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A 10% decrease in Emergency Department (ED) attendances by older patients was noted in the acute hospital at this time as patients declined transfer from their homes to attend hospital care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As a result, the existing community frailty response service was expanded to operate 7 days a week to provide emergency assessment and treatment in the patient’s home and when appropriate facilitated access to secondary care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】This case highlights the additional complexities involved in caring for frail patients with COVID-19 and the importance of the multidisciplinary approach to care. Close clinical monitoring and nurse supervision allowed for the early detection of potential deterioration of the patients and helped reduce viral transmission by limiting exit-seeking behaviour. Input from the public health and COVID response team incorporating registered advanced nurse practitioner and Consultant Geriatrician support provided expert advice on a range of clinical matters and infection prevention and control measures. The integration of services is in line with and emphasizes the advantages of the Irish health service’s objective of integration of primary, community and hospital care around the needs and choices of the patients while supporting them to remain in their communities (as detailed in the Slaintecare report) and adheres to COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Examination of Measures to 2021 Report to the Minister for Health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Current data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is rare within 5–8 months. Data on healthcare workers (HCWs) demonstrate an 83% reduction in risk, with median protective effect observed 5 months following primary infection. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> Data in HCWs demonstrate that anti-Spike IgG remains elevated for 6 months post-infection. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> Although IgG levels may be present for months and may be correlated with neutralizing antibody activity, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> the data are not, however, conclusive that antibody positivity protects from reinfection. A significant limiting factor in these studies is the focus on HCWs, who are overwhelmingly under 65 years of age.

On examination, no change was observed in the mucosal surface of the esophagus, but we found stricture associated with compression from the outside. Subsequently, he underwent positron emission tomography–computed tomography (CT), and multiple lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular fossa, mediastinal, intraperitoneal and right inguinal nodes, showed通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation. Because the mediastinal lymph node metastasis was pressing on his esophagus, he underwent esophageal self-expanding uncovered metal stent insertion, and his symptoms improved. A mediastinal lymph node (#7) biopsy conducted by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration revealed squamous cell carcinoma. However, a whole-body examination could not detect the primary lesion, and he was diagnosed with postoperative recurrence of CUP. Since lung cancer has more treatment options than other cancers, we considered his CUP as a subtype of lung cancer. Figure 1A details his treatment course with some events. Chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; Days 1, 8 and 15 in a 4-week cycle) and carboplatin (target area under the curve, 6; Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) was initiated as first-line treatment. Ramucirumab (10 mg/kg, Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) and docetaxel (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) were administered as second-line treatment. The patient underwent biopsy of the tumor within the esophageal stent, and the tumor was histologically determined as squamous cell carcinoma . Thereafter, the patient was initiated on third-line treatment with S-1 (100 mg/day, Days 1–28 in a 6-week cycle). After one cycle of S-1, the tumor at the lower edge of the esophageal stent grew and the patient often vomited because of obstruction. He underwent esophageal self-expanding covered metal stent insertion at the site of obstruction and could resume eating. Three weeks after stenting, he received nivolumab as fourth-line treatment. After three cycles of nivolumab, he had a high fever and productive cough with purulent sputum. A chest CT showed consolidation along the right bronchus that demonstrated pneumonia and a fistula at the truncus intermedius . He then underwent bronchoscopy, where we found three bronchoesophageal fistulae . Furthermore, we placed a third esophageal covered stent to seal the tracheoesophageal communication after the pneumonia improved. However, his left vocal cord got paralyzed due to the enlargement of the left cervical lymph node metastasis, which was found on bronchoscopy examination. Although he underwent dysphagia rehabilitation, he developed aspiration pneumonia. He stopped food intake by his mouth, and underwent gastrostomy. Subsequently, his general condition worsened, and he died from suffocation because of clogging with sputum.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Findings on chest CT.

This therapeutic complication is serious and can be fatal. Recently, it was reported that durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy might cause bronchomediastinal fistulae in stage III non-small cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, there are few reports on the relationship between ICIs and fistula formation. Acral vascular necrosis, which indicates small vessel vasculitis and leads to ischemia, was introduced as an immune-related adverse event of ICIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case, given that nivolumab caused vasculitis in the area around the stent, vasculitis might have led to necrosis and fistula formation. Furthermore, in our case, besides nivolumab, two other factors, including the esophageal stent and ramucirumab may have been related to the fistulae. It has been reported that placement of an esophageal stent induces tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Since our patient had a second esophageal stent placement before fistula formation, some part of the tissue around the stent may have become necrotic because of the process of inflammation.

Based on the above considerations, we might be able to explain the process of fistula formation associated with ICIs . Antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, are often used in combination chemotherapy for many types of cancers, and there are some reports about fistula formation and delay in wound healing associated with the use of these drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, 156 days had passed since the last administration of ramucirumab to the development of bronchoesophageal fistula. Because the half-life of ramucirumab is reported to be ~8 days, ramucirumab is unlikely to be a factor in fistula formation. Thus, administration of ICIs might have triggered fistula formation in this patient. Since there are only a few cases of ICIs and fistulas, the attending physician should check whether the patients have a stent before administration of ICIs.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient and his family for providing informed consent for the processing of his personal data for this publication.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>S.Y. received honoraria from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a giant localized hepatohilar mass . Histology of percutaneous transhepatic biopsy specimens led to a diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). Thus, chemotherapy with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (pemetrexed: 500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on Day 1; cisplatin: 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on Day 1) was intravenously administered every 21 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After a total of six identical courses, the maximum tumour diameter did not change as revealed by contrast-enhanced CT and thus the treatment response was categorized as SD (stable disease) according to the RECIST guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Given that protracted myelosuppression rendered the planned chemotherapy more difficult to administer, surgical resection was performed 5 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy (RECIST; SD). The encapsulated tumour originated from the right upper retroperitoneum, compressing the surrounding organs but not directly invading them, and a simple tumourectomy was subsequently completed. The intra-operative lavage cytology showed a negative result. Consequently, the completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which is generally used to assess the extent of residual disease at the end of a surgical resection for peritoneal surface malignancies, was CC-0 (no visible residual disease). Histology of the resected specimen established a definitive diagnosis of epithelioid MPM, in which histological chemotherapeutic effect was rarely seen. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed this diagnosis (positive for calretinin, D2–40 and CK5/6; negative for BerEP4 and MOC31). The post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 7 days after surgery. Further use of cisplatin plus pemetrexed was certainly considered one of the possible recommended treatment, but the patient already had undergone long-term drug tolerance and was no longer hoping for further treatment. No sign of recurrence was observed 60 months after surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Contrast-enhanced CT axial view shows a giant localized hepatohilar mass, presenting poor and inhomogeneous enhancement, ~150 mm in size.

The patient was presumed to be adherent on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and was initiated on respective treatments for the opportunistic infections but continued to deteriorate. On further reviewing, he was found to be poorly adherent to ART and was advised enhanced adherence counselling after which his condition improved. We report this case to emphasize the importance of adherence to ART medications in the management of patients with HIV.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have high morbidity and mortality owing to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Early diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of management in patients with advanced HIV. Although a lot of stress is laid on the initiation of therapy, monitoring of compliance and importance of adherence in management is often neglected. We present a case of advanced HIV with multiple opportunistic infections to emphasize that adherence to ART is the most effective tool in managing patients with advanced HIV, and poor treatment adherence is associated with adverse outcomes.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old gentleman who worked in the para-military forces presented to a secondary care hospital with intermittent high-grade fever associated with loss of appetite and weight (around 10 kg) for a year. He was found to be positive for HIV-1 infection and was advised ART. He did not initiate ART and presented 2 months later to us with fever, shortness of breath and loose stools for 15 days. He was found to have a CD4 count of 62/mcl. A chest X-ray and computed tomography of the chest was done for these complaints, which was suggestive of _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia. He was managed in the intensive care unit with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and steroids. After 2 days of initiation of treatment, he developed erythema over forearm, neck, chest and extremities. This was accompanied by oral mucosal involvement and punctate keratopathy. He was diagnosed as Steven Johnson syndrome-toxic epidemo-necrolysis overlap secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was immediately stopped, and he was put on steroids. His lesions resolved in next 2 weeks and he was started on tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz along with dapsone prophylaxis. ART was not started earlier as both tenofovir and efavirenz could have worsened the skin condition. He was discharged in a stable condition. He reported proper compliance in all his out-patient visits. Eighteen months into the illness, he started to have dysphagia and small bowel type of diarrhoea (15–20 times/day, non-bloody, not associated with abdominal pain and tenesmus) for which he was admitted. On upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, he was found to have oesophagal candidiasis and was started on fluconazole. Stool microscopy revealed _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts, and he was initiated on nitazoxanide. However, he continued to have diarrhoea with multiple stool samples detecting _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts and had persistent dyselectrolytemia for which oral supplementation was given. He continued to deteriorate and was found to have features of dehydration, severe wasting, candidiasis (oral) and diffuse ichthyosis on examination. Dosage of nitazoxanide was increased, and azithromycin was added once daily for cryptosporidiosis to which he responded partially.\n\n【6】His CD4 count was zero, and viral load was high. His previous CD4 counts done at six-monthly intervals after the baseline count of CD4 of 62/mcl were 104/mcl and 76/mcl. With suspicion of failure, he was started on zidovudine, lamivudine and atazanavir/ritonavir. Single-tablet regimen with a protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitor was not available under the national scheme for use in this patient. HIV resistance genotyping did not detect any resistance to any of the tested drugs. On reviewing the history, he reported decreased adherence to the ART medications as he avoided taking his medications in front of his co-workers on outstation postings. He also seemed to be extremely worried about his ill health. He was counselled about the severity of his condition and the importance of adherence. He was referred to a trained psychologist for evaluation. He was found to be depressed and was started on anti-depressant by the psychiatrist. He was continued on a PI-based therapy, owing to its higher barrier to resistance, considering his history of non-compliance.\n\n【7】He continued to have persistent diarrhoea along with dysphagia not responding to fluconazole. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis was suspected in addition to candidiasis based on raised CMV viral load and UGI endoscopy findings. He was started on valganciclovir after which his CMV viral load became negative. His diarrhoea and dysphagia eventually improved and was discharged on PI-based ART, dapsone prophylaxis and fluconazole. He was also registered for regular follow-up with the psychologist and psychiatrist.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Cryptosporidiosis is commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV with an overall prevalence of 8.7%. These patients present with a diarrheal illness which may last for months resulting in weight loss, malnutrition and extended hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although nitazoxanide is approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, it is often ineffective. Other agents like azithromycin and PIs have been tried with minimal success. Effective ART is probably the most effective tool in managing patients with cryptosporidiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】CMV infection is associated with rapid HIV disease progression and consequently, more acquired immune deficiency syndrome related events. ART is not only effective in controlling HIV replication but also decreases CMV-related adverse events by the restoration of CMV-specific immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. CMV-related gastrointestinal disease is seen in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression. Oesophagus and colon are the most important sites that are affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ganciclovir/valganciclovir, along with the initiation of effective ART, is the treatment of choice.\n\n【11】India has a total of >2 million HIV-positive individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most of these patients are managed in ART centres linked to the national programme. The national programme was initiated in 1992, and it has been giving free ART to all HIV registered HIV patients since 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The programme continues to give free ART to all the registered patients despite the decrease in its funding. The national programme has tried to keep up with the recommendations on the treatment given by the World Health Organisation. Since 2013, the first-line treatment has been a single-tablet regimen of tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For those who fail the first-line treatment, they are shifted to a two-pill regimen containing atazanavir/ritonavir. While the programme works fairly well for most patients, in this patient, there were certain challenges. At the time, the patient presented routine viral load monitoring was not available for all patients at the centre. It was done only for those patients where immunological failure was suspected. Despite access to free ART, the number of centres that dispense medications is limited, leading to high patient turn over in each centre. Due to the high patient turn, the time spent with each patient is suboptimal, leading to a poor patient–physician relationship. Also, adherence is measured by pill counting method and therefore, it is easy to miss non-compliance. Single-tablet regimen with dolutegravir has been recently introduced in the national scheme, but it was not available at the time, the patient was being managed.\n\n【12】Variable drug adherence was noted (47–90%) in the studies from Indian centres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The problem of drug adherence is further compounded by high pill burden, poor health literacy and treatment-related side effects in patients with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART is associated with inadequate viral suppression, increased resistance and increased opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. It is essential to spend time with the patient and understand his/her problems during the initiation of ART. Patients are often scared of revealing their medical condition to their employers for fear of being judged and losing their job. It is also essential to empowering the patient about their rights 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART, due to various socio-economic factors, is often missed by healthcare staffs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It is imperative to consider the social aspects like living conditions, economic support, working conditions and family support.\n\n【13】Potential solutions to improve adherence include better education and motivation of patients, early referral for diagnosis and treatment, home visits, an increase in human resources and, creating social support groups. Patient education programmes are essential not only in the hospital but also in the communities near patients’ residence. This would help to dispel the misconceptions and stigma associated with HIV infection. Adherence counselling, although a time-consuming process is an advantageous intervention in terms of overall patient outcome.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nil.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was taken prior to publications.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor—same as the corresponding author.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:01:44", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:01:57", "cost": 13.622}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:01:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:01:44"}

Our case is the first case that depicts development of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) following infection with COVID-19, with a challenging diagnosis and spontaneous improvement. A 65-year-old diabetic female presented with a complete external ophthalmopegia in the left eye and a severe left-sided headache. The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Brain and orbital computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were both unremarkable. We diagnosed the case as THS after ruling out other differential diagnoses. The patient refused to receive prednisone, so we had to observe her closely for 6 months during which period we recorded a spontaneous recovery. Acute ophthalmoplegia is a very challenging presentation. It needs full workup to exclude the wide range of differential diagnoses.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Since the start of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, a number of both benign and vision-threatening neuro-ophthalmic manifestations have been documented in COVID-19 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> of which we cite optic neuritis, nystagmus, visual field abnormalities, headache, diplopia, visual impairment, ocular pain, Miller Fisher syndrome and painful cranial neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cranial neuropathies, especially painful ophthalmoplegia, have a wide range of differential diagnoses, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Here, we have a rare case of complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with unremarkable radiological findings and spontaneous remission through long-term observation.\n\n【5】The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 65-year-old Caucasian female with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was admitted to our ophthalmology department. She presented with left periocular pain, droopy eyelid and left ocular movement limitation for a period of 4 days. Two weeks before admission, she had had a severe left-sided headache unresponsive to sedatives, along with fatigue, dry cough and fever. The patient denied any history of trauma or recreational drug use.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed a complete external ophthalmoplegia on the left eye and total left ptosis with a mild chemosis. The pupil was semi-dilated and non-reactive to light. We also recorded mild proptosis on Hertel exophthalmometer (3-mm discrepancy between the two eyes). Uncorrected visual acuity was 0.6 (0.18 LogMAR), intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg and Ishihara color test was normal .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Photograph of the patient in six positions at the presentation, showing prominent ophthalmoplegia in the left eye.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was conscious, oriented and responsive to stimuli. Tendon reflexes and muscle tone were all within normal limits. There were no meningeal or cerebellar signs. Ear, nose and throat examinations were within normal as well. Sensory system examination was totally normal at presentation. However, a left corneal hypoesthesia appeared 2 days after admission, which was consistent with an injury in the first branch of the fifth cranial nerve.\n\n【11】Laboratory studies (including CBC, PT, INR, D-Dimer, ferritin, urea, LDH, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, sodium, potassium and calcium) were all within normal limits. By contrast, C-reactive protein was elevated (11.4 mg/l) and so was blood glucose (300 mg/dl).\n\n【12】Polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was positive, and brain and orbital computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both unremarkable. There was no sign of inflammation nor of a mass.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) was made after the exclusion of other pathologies. The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 unit for close observation and blood glucose control and for the overall management of her COVID-19 symptoms. Brain MRI was normal upon its repetition after a week.\n\n【14】The patient’s status later improved, and she was discharged home with monthly reviewing.\n\n【15】On follow-up, her ocular symptoms and signs started to improve spontaneously 3 months after admission. A regression in the ptosis, a partial recovery in the third and fourth cranial nerves were detected. She could adduct, elevate and depress the left eye into primary and adduction positions.\n\n【16】Corneal sensation was recovered 5 months after presentation. She could fully open her left eye. The pupil became round, regular and reactive to light, but she was unable to abduct the eye. This meant a complete spontaneous restoration of the third, fourth and first branches of the fifth cranial nerve .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Photograph of the patient in nine positions after 5-month follow-up, showing improvement in the eye movements except for the sixth nerve in the left eye.</u>\n\n【18】By the end of the 6-month period, all the involved nerve functions were restored except for the sixth nerve and the patient ended up with exotropia. At present, the patient is complaining of diplopia and is being prepared for strabismus surgery.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Reports of neuro-ophthalmic complications in COVID-19 patients, such as cranial nerve paresis, optic neuritis and gaze palsy, are being increasingly described in the literature. This is a case of an infrequent presentation of painful complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with radiologically normal imaging. We documented the natural course of the spontaneous remission of the neuropathies with no treatment.\n\n【21】Cranial nerve palsies with COVID-19 were reported. However, to our knowledge, this is the first case to report a concomitant four cranial nerves palsies, CN III, IV, V and VI.\n\n【22】Ophthalmoparesis has a wide range of differential diagnoses; multiple sclerosis, neoplasms, malignancies, giant cell arteritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, THS, diabetes mellitus and cavernous sinus thrombosis.\n\n【23】In this specific case, there was acute severe complete external ophthalmoplegia, left corneal hypoesthesia, total ptosis and mild proptosis, with a history of severe headache and cough. We made the diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) after ruling out all the other pathologies.\n\n【24】Our patient had normal CT and MRI with no signs of masses or hyperintensity at presentation. They were also normal on repetition after a week. We could not use gadolinium for it was unavailable in our hospital.\n\n【25】Although the patient had uncontrolled diabetes, the clinical presentation was far from the classic presentation of diabetic ophthalmoplegia; it indicated a pathology in the orbital apex rather than only a diabetic ischemia. Our patient had severe and acute paralysis of three cranial nerves simultaneously, and all the nerves enter the cranial cavity through the orbital apex. As well as, the sensitive part of the fifth nerve was injured. Based on clinical presentation and MRI findings, we were able to rule out the most notable differential diagnoses and make the diagnosis of THS. The THS diagnosis is a triad of one or more episodes of unilateral orbital pain, paresis of one or more of the cranial nerves and granulomas in MRI or biopsy; which is sensitive for the diagnosis of the syndrome. However, the fact that over half of the reported cases had normal MRI renders the diagnosis dependent on the exclusion of other etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The patient was not given the corticosteroids treatment at her demand. She showed spontaneous remission and had to be monitored over a 6-month period.\n\n【27】Since our patient was positive for COVID-19, and there was no detection of any other possible etiology such as other infections, trauma, tumor or malignancy, we theorize that the SARS-COV-2 virus may have triggered an immunological reaction leading to the development of the ophthalmoplegia, which we believe is THS.\n\n【28】Our case is the first to report the development of complete acute ophthalmoplegia following COVID-19 infection with normal MRI and spontaneous improvement.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to express our great appreciation to Mr Zain Hummamy for his valuable efforts toward ensuring both the linguistic correctness and the linguistic accuracy of the study.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors does not have any conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this work.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images were obtained from the patient.

This infection usually presents in high prevalence in the rural areas of East Asia and Western pacific islands. It usually presents with fever, chill, myalgia, headache, skin rashes, having pathognomonic and skin lesion i.e. eschar in ~10% cases in Indian subcontinent. It can present with life-threatening complications on occasional. The simultaneous presentation of more than two complications is uncommon, rarely reported in literature.

The incubation period is usually 6–21 days. The infected patient commonly presents with fever, chill, headache, myalgia, skin rashes, eschar and lymphadenopathy. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of scrub typhus may lead to develop serious complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, meningoencephalitis and rhabdomyolysis, which predominate in second week of untreated infection.

Fever was moderate grade, intermittent without any chill and rigor. The jaundice was gradually progressive. The chest pain was dull aching, diffuse and non-radiating, not associated with sweating. The patient disoriented 2 days prior to admission. There was no history of abdominal pain, vomiting, joint pain, skin rashes, oral ulcers, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal bleeding, headache and convulsion. Her menstrual history was normal. She had no history of ischemic heart disease, blood transfusion, intake of alcohol, any chronic drug use (steroid), over the counter or traditional medications and herbs before and after admission.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Photograph showing icterus.</u>\n\n【8】On physical examination, patient was drowsy, Glasgow Coma Scale was 10/15 (E2V4M4), pulse rate was 120/min, blood pressure was 100/70, respiratory rate was 22/min, axillary temperature was 102°F and there were no rashes on skin. The patient was icteric  and had mild pallor. There was diffuse tenderness over right hypochondrium on abdominal examination. She had bilateral extensor planter. S <sub>3 </sub> gallop was found on cardiovascular examination. Considering these clinical scenario infections, which are commonly diagnosed in India, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis and scrub typhus were thought of but autoimmune diseases were also kept in mind.\n\n【9】Complete hemogram revealed anemia (hemoglobin 9.2 g%), marked leukocytosis (90 400/cmm), thrombocytopenia (platelet 1 lac/cmm) and left shift on peripheral blood smear (neutrophils and band forms 70%, myelocytes 2%, metamyelocytes 10%, monocytes 2%, eosinophils 2%). She had normal serum electrolytes (serum Na+ 138 mEq/l, K+ 3.8 mEq/l) and renal functions (Ur 22 mg/dl, Cr 0.7 mg/dl). There was conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 7.6 mg/dl, direct/indirect 5.6 mg/dl/2 mg/dl), marked transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] 3552 U/l, alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] 4055 U/l) with normal serum albumin and globulin level on liver function test, which suggested acute hepatitis. There was coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT, 54.2 s) international normalized ratio (INR, 6.45) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, 34.2 s). Serum ammonia was 94.4 mcg/dl, which suggested of hepatic encephalopathy. She had lactate dehydrogenase (1032 U/l), C-reactive protein (32.2 mg/dl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm first 1 h) and procalcitonin was negative (0.4 ng/ml). Serum triglyceride was 176 mg/dl. Ultrasonography of abdomen showed increased liver echogenicity. Her blood and urine were sterile. Autoimmune workup like anti-nuclear antibody was negative.\n\n【10】She had towering liver enzymes with acute liver failure but serologically negative for hepatotropic virus (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus, hepatitis A virus). Serology for IgM dengue/IgM leptospira was negative. No malarial parasites were found on peripheral blood smear; Malaria Parasite Dual Antigen (MPDA) was also negative. But she had positive IgM for scrub typhus detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of brain was normal; cerebrospinal fluid study was done to rule out any central nervous system (CNS) infection, but it was normal.\n\n【11】Her drowsiness was explained by hepatic encephalopathy after ruled out all possible metabolic and septic causes of encephalopathy, CNS infection and vascular events.\n\n【12】For chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) was done, showing ST-depression on lateral leads predominantly (V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6, </sub> lead 1, Augmented Vector Left (aVL))  with elevated Troponin-T and Creatine Phosphokinase - MB (CPK-MB); there was global hypokinesia of left ventricle with ejection fraction 45% on transthoracic echocardiography, which suggested of myocarditis noninvasively supported by history of non-ischemic chest pain and normalization of ST-T changes, cardiac enzymes and echocardiographic findings later, after institution of disease directed treatment. Because of coagulopathy, with PT (54.2 s) INR (6.45) and aPTT (34.2 s), coronary angiography was not done.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|ECG showing ST depression on lead I, aVL, V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6 </sub> .</u>\n\n【14】For leukocytosis, to rule out myeloproliferative disorders, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done, which showed reactive marrow with myeloid: erythroid (M:E): 3:1 and no abnormal and hemophagocytic cells.\n\n【15】For reactive marrow and leukocytosis, we did leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score, it came out 110, which is high, so leukemoid reaction was confirmed. The patient was hemodynamically stable with ho history of hypotension; so this leukemoid reaction was not explained by hepatic necrosis.\n\n【16】Initially, the patient was treated symptomatically for acute liver failure and myocarditis. She was put on intravenous doxycycline for 14 days after positive scrub typhus report. The patient was improved gradually and became asymptomatic with normalization of liver enzymes (ALT 34 U/l and AST 28 U/l), thin-layer chromatography was 9800/cmm, cardiac enzymes (CPK-MB and troponin T) and ST-T changes on ECG on discharge and asked to take rest another few days, avoid strenuous activities and slowly increase exercise level.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】Elevation of liver enzymes is common in scrub typhus but acute liver failure is rarely reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Presentation of chest pain with tachycardia and S <sub>3 </sub> gallop suggested myocarditis, which was confirmed by ECG findings (ST depression, T inversion) and elevated troponin T and CPK-MB. Myocarditis rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and postulated to be caused by localized infection in endothelial cells of heart and cardiac myocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Leukemoid reaction which, is very unusual following scrub typhus, can be explained as physiological response to overwhelming infection, which releases stimulatory molecules like growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT) ligand), adhesion molecules (CD11b/CD18) and various cytokines (interleukin-1, 3, 6, 8, tumour necrosis factor) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It often mimics hematological malignancy and could be differentiated by elevated LAP score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In a tropical country like India, scrub typhus serology should be done in acute febrile patient presenting with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis. Scrub typhus infection has an excellent therapeutic response to inexpensive antibiotic doxycycline within 5 days of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Early therapeutic intervention with doxycycline should be intensified in endemic countries.\n\n【21】Scrub typhus has emerged as a common etiology of febrile illness in Southeast Asian countries. It is underrecognized infection, which may present with serious complications like myocarditis and acute liver failure. Leukemoid reaction may be seen in scrub typhus like other triggering infections. In patients with acute febrile illness with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis, scrub typhus should be ruled out in all cases. Timely diagnosis of disease and therapy with doxycycline/or azithromycin leads to excellent prognosis.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to mention our gratitude to Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh, Head of Department, Department of Internal Medicine, IPGMER and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:20", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:36", "cost": 15.317}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:20"}

We present the case of a septuagenarian countering such odds to become a long-term glioblastoma survivor for 3.5 years (whilst being IDH-1 wildtype).\n\n【4】CASE SUMMARY\n------------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man presented to hospital in June 2014. He had mild confusion, 24 h of left leg weakness and 6 months of headache. He was an ex-smoker of 43 years and enjoyed regular exercise. His baseline Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was > 90. A contrast CT  demonstrated two lesions: 65 × 45 × 43 mm (103 378 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) irregularly contrast enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe and a smaller 25 × 20 × 08 mm (7853 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) mass inferiorly to it. Total volume was 111 231 mm <sup>3 </sup> . This caused 12 mm midline shift, hydrocephalus and midbrain compression. High-dose dexamethasone was commenced.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|( **A** – **C** ) Contrast CT at presentation (axial, coronal and sagittal) demonstrating a large right temporal lesion and peri-lesional oedema (dashed arrow), contralateral hydrocephalus (short straight arrow), causing significant mass effect, including uncal and subfalcine herniation (long straight arrow).</u>\n\n【7】On transfer to our unit 9 h later, he deteriorated from GCS 15 to GCS 7 (localizing to pain, no eye opening and no verbal response). A repeat CT revealed worsening mass effect. 1 g of Levetiracetam (LEV) was given (and continued twice daily) orally and an overnight emergency surgical resection was performed to save life. The patient took several days to recover. Histopathology revealed a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) . Molecular markers revealed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) wildtype and O通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation. Ki67-index was ~ 25%. A post-operative CT and MRI  demonstrated a 95% subtotal resection (STR), as residual enhancement persisted, making a post-operative volume of 24 × 14 mm (5277 mm <sup>3 </sup> ). He underwent radical radiotherapy (XRT) of 60GY in 30 fractions and concomitant TMZ in September 2014. This was followed by 6 months of TMZ finishing in February 2015. Radiological surveillance was 3-monthly. The patient had a good response and his KPS score was < 70%. He was independent at home in all activities of daily living.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Histology and immunohistochemistry demonstrating pleomorphic cells and nuclear atypia ( **A** ), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression ( **B** ), IDH-1 <sup>wt </sup> ( **C** ) and Ki67 proliferation ( **D** ); from left to right.

The patient underwent re-resection and a 93% STR was achieved . The post-operative histology and molecular markers remained consistent. Palliative chemotherapy with TMZ was commenced. Following his third cycle, he was readmitted in May 2017 due to a week’s history of headache and transient facial weakness. MRI showed a sizeable right-sided subdural hygroma .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|: (A–C) A surveillance contrast T1W MRI (axial, coronal and sagittal) conducted at 33 months demonstrating lesional recurrence in the right temporal lobe (arrow) and minimal mass effect prior to re-operation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|: ( **A** – **C** ) Post-operative contrast T1W MRI (axial, coronal and sagittal) showing significant lesional reduction but medial lesional enhancement (arrow) representing a STR.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|T2W MRI (axial) conducted at 36 months from original presentation demonstrating a right sided subdural collection consistent radiologically to a hygroma (arrow).</u>\n\n【14】As his symptoms spontaneously resolved and there was no neurological deficit, this was managed conservatively. TMZ was continued and repeat imaging in August demonstrated improved appearances. An MRI in December 2017 showed new contrast enhancing areas in the resection cavity indicative of disease recurrence. He was switched to procarbazine and lomustine for 6 weeks. In March 2018 following his second cycle, and his KPS deteriorating to < 50, his treatment was stopped and supportive care instituted as a strategy due to further disease progression on MRI and worsening side effects of chemotherapy. The patient died on May 2018: 3 years and 11 months from initial diagnosis.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】The incidence of glioblastoma is rising 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. About 3–5% of long-term survivors (> 24 months) have a mean age of ~ 37 years. This is rare in advancing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Almost all studies demonstrate a negative correlation between increasing age and survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients > 65 years are considered higher risk for poorer outcomes due to poorer physiological reserve, therapy resistance and neurocognitive function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> irrespective of other prognostic factors, e.g. molecular markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, outliers do exist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Consequently, long-term survival is probably multifactorial.\n\n【17】Our patient had an STR. A gross total resection (no demonstrable contrast-enhancing residual tumour) is a positive prognostic marker in overall survival (OS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, OS is strongly dependent on adjuvant chemotherapy. The decision to offer such treatment is dependent on patient, imaging and surgical characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. A poor performance status (PS) is an independent risk factor for mortality 12-month following treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Our patient had a good PS until palliation. Therefore, assessment of patients should not centre on identifying advantageous molecular targets in isolation to broader clinical parameters. Scoring systems calculating co-morbidity and predicting mortality do exist, e.g. Cumulative Illness Rating Scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Regardless of age, it is imperative to identify patients who have an actual capacity to benefit from treatment.\n\n【18】The landmark Stupp protocol established the standard of care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It ironically excluded patients > 70 years. Recent studies demonstrate that O通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation combined to TMZ and short-course XRT improved survival compared with short-course XRT in older patients (suggesting aggressive treatment can be tolerated) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Our patient had MGMT methylation. MGMT encoded DNA-repair proteins remove alkylating agents causing chemotherapy resistance. Methylation results in transcriptional silencing increasing OS from TMZ and XRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. MGMT methylated GBMs are localized more to frontal lobes conferring a better prognostic outlook 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ironically, our patient had a temporal tumour. It is hypothesized that LEV in conjunction to TMZ could result in increased OS compared with TMZ alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> It enhances MGMT silencing. Our patient was on LEV.\n\n【19】Overall, a single biomarker is unlikely to correlate to a meaningful clinical response in all patients. The complex molecular cascade requiring activation to enable an anti-neoplastic response coupled to the molecular complexity of glioblastoma dictates this. Clearly, our patient demonstrated advantageous biology to endure two craniotomies and adjuvant oncology treatments. This highlights a need for individualized care.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【21】We demonstrate that older age does not exclude long-term survival of glioblastoma. With an aging population, it is ever more critical to individualize patient care in a holistic fashion.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTING OF INTEREST\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This has patient consent.

Although calcium channel blockers are considered first-line drugs to prevent coronary vasospasm, they also have the potential to induce ST elevation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS. Therefore, the optimal medication for such a complicated case is still underdetermined. We report a male patient who presented with VF due to BrS, which was later found to have coexisted with coronary vasospasm. He was treated with low-dose bepridil expecting both its anti-arrhythmic and vasodilatory effects, but a later acetylcholine provocation test showed no suppression of vasospasm. Based on these results, we decided to add nitrates to the medication. This case report illustrates that drug selection needs caution in BrS when complicated with vasospastic angina and that bepridil monotherapy may not be sufficient to suppress coronary vasospasm in such cases.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Brugada syndrome (BrS) is one of the important causes of sudden cardiac death in young people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is known that 11–13% of BrS patients have intercurrent coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Although calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are considered first-line drugs to prevent coronary vasospasm, they also have the potential to induce ST elevation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Therefore, effective medical treatment for BrS with coronary vasospasm is still under debate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】The case is a 46-year-old male with a smoking history. Although he was pointed out to have a Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) in a past occupational medical health checkup, he was observed without further examination because of a lack of symptoms and family history. One day in the early morning, he lost consciousness at home, and an ambulance was called by his family. Upon the arrival of the emergency services, he was in cardiac arrest due to VF and was taken to our hospital after successful resuscitation for a VF with an automatic external defibrillator. In the emergency department, his ECG showed idioventricular rhythm with a heart rate of 110/min, and no obvious ST elevation was observed. The echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with normal wall motion and valvular function. The emergency coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis, and he was tentatively diagnosed with idiopathic VF and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He underwent target temperature management (35°C for 24 h) and regained consciousness 12 h after the rewarming without neurological deficit. The follow-up 12-lead ECG showed early repolarization, but a typical Brugada-type ECG was not observed . Considering the possibility of VF due to coronary vasospasm, we performed an acetylcholine provocation test on the fifth hospital day. No spasm occurred in the right coronary artery, but sub-occlusion was observed in the left anterior descending artery after administration of 50 μg and 100 μg of acetylcholine . On the other hand, he did not complain of chest symptoms and no significant changes in the ECG were observed during the spasm provocation. On the ninth hospital day, a pilsicainide administration test was performed. Immediately after the drug administration, ST-segment elevation with the right bundle branch block was observed in V1 and V2 . Based on these findings, he was diagnosed as VF due to BrS. He was implanted with a subcutaneous ICD on the 12th hospital day to prevent sudden cardiac death. He started taking bepridil at 100 mg/day to suppress VF recurrence and was discharged on the 16th hospital day. A month after discharge, an acetylcholine provocation test was performed once again to evaluate the efficacy of bepridil on the coronary vasospasm. As a result, the coronary spasm was induced by 50 μg of acetylcholine in both the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery . Based on this result, we decided to add nitrates to the medication. His subsequent course was uneventful and being followed up at the outpatient clinic on a regular basis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|ECGs at different time points.

Although bepridil is classified as CCB, it can also suppress multiple K channels including Ito, and the subsequent upregulation of Na channels is thought to suppress VF via increasing Na current 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Although CCB is the first choice for the treatment of vasospastic angina, there is a concern that suppression of inward Ca current in BrS may increase ventricular arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It has also been reported that K-channel opening drugs, known as vasodilators, induced coved-type ST elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition to the above-mentioned antiarrhythmic effect, bepridil has been reported to be safe and effective in stable angina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, we expected this drug to have an inhibitory effect on both coronary spasm and arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. However, in our case, the coronary spasm was not suppressed by bepridil monotherapy, but rather worsened in the second acetylcholine provocation test. Therefore, we decided to add nitrate to suppress coronary spasms, in accordance with precedent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Since nitrate tolerance can develop with long-term use, and the possible calcium channel blocking effects of nitrates have been pointed out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, their efficacy should be evaluated periodically.\n\n【11】Brugada phenocopies are clinical entities in which the diagnostic criteria for BrS are not fulfilled, but the Brugada-type ECG is induced by certain clinical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Previously, Itoh _et al_ . reported a case of vasospastic angina presenting Brugada-type ECG abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In their case, combination therapy with diltiazem and flecainide could suppress both anginal symptoms and syncope caused by VF. However, our case differs in that acetylcholine administration did not induce Brugada-type ECG or VF, nor did it provoke any chest symptoms.\n\n【12】One might surmise that the coronary spasm could not be suppressed due to the low dose of bepridil, but there was a concern about the dose-dependent QT-prolonging effect. Since it has been reported that low-dose bepridil is effective enough for BrS with SCN5A mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, we adopted 100 mg/day in this case. As drug options are limited in BrS with coronary spasms, further research is needed to clarify the true effects of bepridil.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The case report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:33", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:45", "cost": 11.733}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:32", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:32"}

The cardinal feature of progressive prolongation of the PR interval on serial electrocardiograms was the only sign associated with clinical deterioration and was the trigger for rapid investigation and urgent management.

This case emphasises the simple tests every doctor must be cognisant of, especially when the diagnosis is unclear.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 25-year-old male was admitted for elective aortic and pulmonary valve replacement. On admission, he was found to have a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 102 mg/l with normal white cell count. His past medical history was significant for congenital heart disease with a true bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortopathy. He was asymptomatic as a child and remained under surveillance for gradual worsening of his aortic stenosis until undergoing balloon dilatation aged 9, followed by a Ross procedure aged 15 for severe stenosis. He developed progressive aortic root dilation and underwent a redo operation with a Bentall procedure using a 29-mm Perimount prosthesis aged 20. He remained asymptomatic over the following years, until recent echocardiographic surveillance showed development of severe aortic stenosis and mixed disease of the right ventricle–pulmonary artery (RV–PA) homograft, prompting admission for elective surgical intervention.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Initial TTE showing no evidence of para-aortic collection ( **A** ) parasternal long-axis view, ( **B** ) short-axis view with colour Doppler.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|ECGs showing progressive significant increase in PR interval on admission ( **A** ) PR = 158 ms, compared with Day 5 ( **B** ) increased to 292 ms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|TOE showing the large vacuolated aortic root abscess ( **A** ) four-chamber view, ( **B** ) at 61°, ( **C** ) 133° with colour Doppler, ( **D** ) 61° short axis, ( **E** ) 130° short axis with colour Doppler showing systolic flow through the abscess indicating fistula formation with the aortic root, ( **F** ) 61° Short axis with colour Doppler showing the communication of the aortic root abscess to the aortic root.</u>\n\n【10】On admission the patient reported to feeling well, aside from recent flu-like illness which had resolved a week prior. At that time, he had been feeling feverish with myalgia and a non-productive cough. He denied any localising symptoms and his observations were all within normal limits. His physical examination was normal, barring the expected ejection systolic and early diastolic murmurs, with no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. On the day of admission, he underwent a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the aorta in preparation for surgery, which included views of the chest and abdomen. Review of this scan revealed no focus of infection, or para-aortic collections. His urine dipstick and respiratory viral PCR screen were both negative.\n\n【11】While awaiting surgery, he began to clinically deteriorate with tachycardia and fevers. Repeated transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no obvious independently mobile structures on the valves, however due to the extent of degenerative changes of the valve it was difficult to fully exclude vegetations . The patient’s CRP continued to rise over the next 2 days and his blood cultures came back positive for _A. aphrophilus_ .\n\n【12】He was started on Ceftriaxone and Gentamycin, however by Day 5 his CRP had climbed to 317 mg/l with a white cell count of 12.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> g/l and he remained pyrexial. Most significantly, his ECGs showed progressive prolongation of PR interval  from a baseline of 158 to 292 ms. The daily progressive PR interval prolongation was highly suspicious of aortic root abscess formation and triggered urgent further imaging. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed a large echo-dense structure around the aortic root extending posteriorly towards the left atrium. Several small cavities were seen in the mass with blood flow and communication between the cavity and the aortic root . There was also localised extension of the abscess border into the left atrium with potential risk of rupture. Repeat CT was carried out which showed an increase in low attenuation material around the aortic root with two new regions of internal contrast extravasation. This was in keeping with aortic root abscess at the level of the aortic prosthesis with extension into the roof of the left atrium .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|White arrows on CT showing expanding aortic root abscess ( **A** ) short-axis view, ( **B** ) rendered reconstruction.

Explanted tissue did not grow anything at culture, but 16S rDNA PCR screen was positive and seq1 PCR detected _A. aphrophilus._ He had an uncomplicated recovery post-operatively and was treated with a further 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics with appropriate normalisation of his CRP. Antibiotic treatment was changed to oral Ciprofloxacin and completed a total of course of 6 weeks. He remained well since stopping antibiotics with no further fevers and normal CRP.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This case highlights the importance of basic tests and investigations in the management of IE. Daily ECGs in IE are often overlooked but progressive PR prolongation was an early sign of worsening underlying pathology and a trigger for urgent action in this case. Aortic root abscesses are a rare but life-threatening complication of IE, predominantly associated with aortic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PR prolongation occurs with aortic root abscesses due to the proximity of the cardiac conduction system. The atrioventricular node sits at the base of the atrial septum with the non-penetrating His bundle travelling along the membranous septum to become the penetrating bundle, passing though the central fibrous body at the apex of the triangle of Koch and directly into the left ventricular outflow tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This pathway takes the conduction system directly beneath the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary aortic leaflets, as well as in close relation to the mitral and tricuspid valves.\n\n【17】The importance of taking multiple blood cultures is also highlighted. Our patient had five sets of blood cultures before being started on antibiotic therapy, two of which were negative at 7 days of incubation. The HACEK group is notoriously difficult to culture and often require prolonged incubation or analysis using DNA PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The likelihood of growing organisms is further reduced following antibiotic therapy therefore at least three cultures should be taken for suspected IE patients before treatment as per European Society of Cardiology guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The case emphasises the value of the fundamental investigations which underpin the management of IE, in particular serial blood cultures and daily ECGs. These crucial tests help guide therapy and are important predictors of evolving complications. This case also demonstrates the value of multi-modality imaging in endocarditis and the importance selecting different imaging modalities when the clinical picture alters, particularly in high-risk groups such as congenital heart disease patients.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding were required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent for submission and publication of this case report including images and associated text has been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The nominated Guarantor is Dr Nada Al-Sakini.

Here, we report a case of keratitis caused by multi-drug-resistant _S. algae_ that was not related to a marine environment.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 66-year-old man was sent to the emergency department from a nursing hospital because of desaturation. He had been hospitalized for more than 2 years in an unconscious state due to a cervical spine injury. He was unable to close his eyes voluntarily. Neither the patient nor his family had a history of marine exposure. At admission, pneumonia was suspected, and conjunctival injection, purulent discharge and central white opacity were detected in his right eye. He was admitted to the respiratory department, and treatment with piperacillin–tazobactam was started for pneumonia. An ophthalmologist examined the patient at the bedside. Examination of his right eye revealed 6.0 × 5.0 mm corneal opacity and hyphema with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination was impossible due to corneal haziness. Corneal swabs were sent for Gram staining, bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing, KOH mount smear and fungal culture. Empirical treatment with tobramycin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin eye drops was started. The KOH smear and Gram stain were negative. After a 2-day incubation, medium-sized gray and dark pink colonies grew on blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . Other types of colony did not grow on the plate. _S. algae_ was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Vitek system (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). 16S rRNA sequencing revealed 99.93% (1410/1411 bp) identity with _S. algae_ JCM 21037(T) (GenBank accession number BALO01000089 ). Susceptibility testing of the isolate indicated susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, colistin and gentamicin, resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and intermediate to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and meropenem. We added steroid eye drops to control the inflammation and continued the antibiotic eye drops. After 14 days, his keratitis had improved.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|_Shewanella algae_ colonies grown on chocolate (left) and blood (right) agar plates.</u>\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Microbial keratitis is inflammation of the cornea caused by bacteria, fungi, or protists. The main causative bacteria are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Serratia_ species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Bacterial keratitis caused by _Shewanella_ species is extremely rare. Only one case of _S. algae_ infection has been reported worldwide; this was in the USA in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In Korea, there has been one case of _S. algae_ endophthalmitis but no reported keratitis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We report the second case of _S. algae_ keratitis worldwide and the first in Asia. Colonies of _Shewanella_ species on medium are convex, circular, and smooth and produce an unusual brown to tan pigment, in contrast to the white colonies of the major keratitis pathogens _S. aureus_ and _P. aeruginosa_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The colonies we observed were also medium-sized circular smooth colonies that were dark pink to brown on both blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . This should inform clinicians of the unusual colony morphology, which differs from that of the major keratitis pathogens observed in clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\n【16】This case has two exceptional aspects. First, the isolate was resistant to multiple drugs. There are no criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of _Shewanella_ species in international guidelines, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Therefore, we used the criteria for _P. aeruginosa_ , which is a related strain. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenem and intermediate to quinolone, which shows more resistant tendency than previous reported isolates. In a 2013 review of 239 cases since 1973, 82%, 94%, 94% and 98% of _Shewanella_ species were susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, _S. algae_ was multi-drug resistant, rendering it difficult to treat, which can lead to treatment failure. Furthermore, the types of antibiotics that can be used in eye drops are limited, decreasing the treatment options.\n\n【17】Second, the patient had no history of seawater exposure. _Shewanella_ infections are often associated with marine exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Our patient had been hospitalized in a nursing hospital for more than 2 years, and his family had no relation to the sea. Consequently, we did not suspect _S. algae_ infection in this patient sooner. It is necessary to consider whether there are _S. algae_ infection routes other than marine exposure. We did not perform other culture such as stool culture, therefore it was not possible to confirm that _S. algae_ existed in the patient as colonization. Although _S. algae_ mainly inhabit the marine environment, there is a possibility of infection even if the patient did not have marine exposure. _S. algae_ is found naturally in wildlife including seawater as well as soil, fish, meat, and dairy product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There have been several cases of eye infections without marine exposure in previously published reports . Although no other investigation has been conducted to find the source of the infection, it should be thought that various environment including care giving staff and ingestion of seafood also can be the sources of infection.\n\n【18】As in this case, clinical isolates can be extremely rare species with high levels of drug resistance and can involve an atypical patient history. For best clinical practice, clinicians need to keep an eye on the laboratory results after ordering cultures.\n\n【19】This is the second report of bacterial keratitis caused by multi-drug resistant _S. algae_ worldwide and the first in Asia. Clinicians must track microbiology test results to determine appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive specific funding.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained in written format from the patient’s family for clinical information to be reported in the journal.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>J.C. and J.E.S.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:40:03", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:40:28", "cost": 24.929}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:40:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:40:04"}

These devices have helped in preventing problems associated with fecal incontinence. Although highly efficient, these devices can also lead to certain complications including rectal ulcer and lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Here, we report a case of a 56-year-old male being treated for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation, who had significant lower GI bleed while being on FMS for stool incontinence. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed multiple rectal ulcers with one large ulcer having a visible pulsating vessel. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of rectal ulcers and GI bleed associated with use of FMS.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fecal incontinence remains a common and difficult problem for hospitalized patients. It is reported in ⁓50% of patients admitted to hospitals and long care facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It can occur in both sexes and patients of all ages. Managing critically ill patients with diarrhea or fecal incontinence is a challenge as it can lead to infections, skin breakdown and ulcerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> Several solutions for fecal incontinence existed including medications such as loperamide and opiate, products such as absorbent pads, rectal foley catheters, artificial sphincters, even colostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the past decade, several fecal management systems (FMSs) have been introduced to deal with diarrhea and incontinence, especially in immobile and critically ill patients. These systems have helped in reducing perianal skin excoriation, infection spread and the overall nursing requirements. Despite the effectiveness and a high safety profile of these devices, there have been reports of adverse events in the published literature. These complications result mostly from pressure injury or traumatic device removal; and may include rectal ulcer, fissures and major traumatic rectal bleed. Here, we present a case of 56-year-old male who had major lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as result of rectal ulcers from FMS use.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old male with extensive past medical history including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), intracranial bleed from aneurysm rupture, on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, who presented with complain of shortness of breath. Patient was started on treatment for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. While in the hospital the patient became obtunded and was intubated for airway protection. Patient was upgraded to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.\n\n【6】While in the MICU patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation and was started on a heparin drip. Patient also was found to have fecal incontinence and a Dignishield FMS was placed. In 2 days after placement of rectal tube, patient had an episode of hematochezia that was small in amount. Heparin was put on hold and hemoglobin was closely monitored. Three days later patient had another large episode of hematochezia, with ⁓150 mL of blood loss and visible clots resulting in hemodynamic instability. Code fusion was initiated and patient was adequately resuscitated with blood transfusion and intravenous fluids. A computed tomographic angiography didn’t reveal any active bleed in the GI tract. Gastroenterology service was consulted who performed an urgent upper endoscopy to rule out any upper GI bleed. The upper endoscopy failed to reveal any bleeding source.\n\n【7】Patient then had bowel prep with polyethylene glycol and underwent colonoscopy the next day. Colonoscopy revealed multiple superficial rectal ulcerations varying in size . It also showed one large deep ulcer, 2 cm in size, was seen in the rectum with a pulsating visible vessel in ulcer base , 3 mL of diluted epinephrine (1:10 000) was injected in ulcer base followed by application of three endoclips to the ulcer with adequate hemostasis. This patient had a previous screening colonoscopy 1 year prior that was negative for any rectal ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|White arrows shows multiple rectal ulcers.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|White arrow shows ulcer closure with endoclips.</u>\n\n【10】The rectal tube was discontinued after these findings. Patient was also started on daily polyethylene glycol to avoid constipation. He completed his course of treatment without any further bleeding and was eventually discharged from the hospital.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Fecal incontinence is the involuntary recurrent passage of stool. Its more commonly seen in patients with advance age, multiparous women, history of obstetric complications and those with anorectal disease or surgery. The availability of FMS provides effective management for fecal incontinence in patients of both short and long care facilities.\n\n【13】Currently there are three main FMSs available in the United States; these includes Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec); Bowel Management System (Hollister) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard). All these FMS have a catheter with an inflatable balloon on one end, which keeps the catheter from being dislodged from the rectum; on the other end of the catheter is an external collection bag for stool collection.\n\n【14】There are potential complications associated with the use of a FMS, these can include loss of anal sphincter muscle tone, infection, abdominal distention, bowel obstruction and perforation, ulcers and rectal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our Patient also developed rectal ulcer with severe GI bleed. The mechanism by which these ulcers develop is due to pressure injury caused by the inflatable balloon. In addition, the buildup of stool above the catheter may also contribute to pressure on the bowel wall resulting in necrosis. This follows similar mechanism as seen in stercoral perforation due large stool burden in severely constipated patients. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Both major brands i.e. Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard) recommend inflating the cuff with 45 mL of tap water and to discontinue use after 29 days. All the patient reported in literature developed bleeding complications between day 3 to 3 weeks post insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Review of literature shows ⁓14 cases reporting rectal bleed in patients on these stool management systems. In five of these case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8–11 \\]</u> the patients were on therapeutic dose of heparin, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. This was also the case in our patient who was on therapeutic dose heparin for atrial fibrillation. Although no studies are available that discuss association between anticoagulation use and ulcer bleed in these patients, both the cases reported in the literature and our case, should keep physicians cautious about severe bleed from rectal ulcer in patients using FMS while on anticoagulation.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】Our case highlights the fact that FMS although safe can have severe complications. Ulcer formation occurs as a result of pressure injury from these devices that employ an inflatable cuff mechanism. Also, physicians need to be cautious when using these devices in patient on anticoagulation and should reassess the need for these catheters every few days.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muhammad Haider (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Madiha Fatima Master (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Muhammad Master (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Evelina Khalilova (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Maga Daoud (Reviewed and edited the manuscript) and Jay Nfonoyim (Reviewed and edited the manuscript)</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DISCLOSURES\n-----------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have nothing to disclose.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>COMPETING INTERESTS\n-------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval not required.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATE AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The corresponding author may be reached out for clinical data.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent policy.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muhammad Haider.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:26:52", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:27:07", "cost": 14.888}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:27:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:26:52"}

It is often associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies. Classical PG is characterized by painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined border, often developing at sites of injury because of the typical pathergy phenomenon. Because of its polymorphic presentation, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. We present a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a young female patient with ulcerative colitis. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG, to the best of our knowledge this is the first case precipitated by TENS. We report a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus and highlight the challenges that the diagnosis of this relatively rare pathology poses to the clinician.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis, a rare inflammatory disease affecting the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There are several types of PG, including classical (ulcerative), bullous, pustular, granulomatous superficial (vegetative), peristomal and post-surgical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The classical form is the most frequent presentation and occurs mainly on the lower extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Classical PG is characterized by the development of sterile inflammatory pustules, which expand into painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. PG may occur in the absence of an underlying pathology, but in up to two-thirds of cases it is associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. IBD is the most common comorbidity in younger PG patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. PG occurs in ~1–2% of IBD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Herein, we report a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 27-year-old woman was referred to our Burn Unit for the management of painful, progressive ulcers located on her legs. She had presented bilateral ankle tendinopathy 5 weeks earlier, for which she underwent TENS sessions (mild electrical currents were administered using electrode pads placed on the skin surface of the lateral and medial sides of both ankles). Following the fifth session, bluish-mauve swellings appeared on the left lateral and medial malleoli and on the right lateral malleolus, which ulcerated and extended despite topical cortisone. She reported no fever or systemic symptoms. Daily local bactericidal dressing and successive antibiotic therapies with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime and piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in the pejoration of the lesions. A computed-tomography scan of the ankles revealed infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue but no bone damage. As there was no improvement, she was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of infected electric burns. Detailed anamnesis revealed a 12-year-old history of UC, stable under mesalazine, not mentioned earlier. Physical examination on admission showed a large purplish ulcer of 16/7 cm, situated on the left lateral malleolus and two smaller ulcers on the left medial and right lateral malleoli . The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Biology tests were normal except for moderate normocytic hypochromic anemia and a C reactive protein value of 52.8 mg/l (normal range 0–5 mg/l). Immunological (rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies and HLA B27), serological tests (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Rickettsia and Leishmania), bacterial and fungal wound swabs and blood cultures were negative. Skin biopsies revealed a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils, with a site of deep abscedation, compatible with PG . Special stains (Periodic Acid Schiff, Wade-Fite, Ziehl-Neelsen and Gram) were negative for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Immunosuppressive treatment with high dose oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) followed by the addition of ciclosporin 1 month later, when steroid tapering began, combined with topical tacrolimus and adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy resulted in a favorable evolution, with complete resolution of the lesions and characteristic cribriform scars at 3.5 months .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|**Panels A–C** : aspect of the wounds at referral to our Burn Unit ( **Panel A** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel B** : left leg, medial malleolus, **Panel C** : right leg, lateral malleolus). **Panels D–F** : follow-up at 3.5 months of treatment ( **Panel D** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel E** : left leg, medial malleolus **Panel F** : right leg, lateral malleolus).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Hematoxylin–eosin stain, showing a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils ( **Panel A** : ×3,46 magnification, **Panel B** : ×20 magnification).</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】PG is the second most frequent dermatologic manifestation of IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It occurs mainly when the IBD is active but can also manifest during quiescent periods or precede the IBD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Because of its polymorphic presentation, frequent association with various systemic diseases and ability to imitate other conditions, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis are common in PG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In our patient, lesions mimicked infected burn wounds, leading to misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and clinical deterioration. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by PG and the importance of thorough patient anamnesis, as the patient’s UC history first raised the suspicion of PG.\n\n【10】To this day, PG remains mainly a clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsies are recommended to exclude other causes of cutaneous ulceration. The histopathology of PG typically shows neutrophilic inflammation, but it is nonspecific (infections and other neutrophilic dermatosis may have similar findings) and can vary based on PG subtype, ulcer stage, timing and site of biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. To date there is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of PG. Su _et al._ proposed in 2004 a diagnostic tool for classical PG requiring two major and two minor criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, but in this algorithm PG remains an exclusion diagnosis, which can be impractical for clinical decision. In 2018, Maverakis _et al._ proposed new criteria based on the Delphi Consensus of International Experts, requiring one major and four minor criteria, and no longer rendering PG as a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. More recently, Jockenhöfer _et al._ developed another diagnostic tool, the PARACELSUS score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient met diagnostic criteria with each of the three above-mentioned scores.\n\n【11】There is no standardized treatment of PG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Topical treatment with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be tried in mild forms or those not associated with systemic disease. For systemic treatment, corticosteroids are first-line 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Corticosteroids may be combined with immunomodulatory agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors or interleukin 1 inhibitors have been increasingly proposed in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. In addition, analgesia and wound care are two cornerstones of PG management. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be a helpful adjuvant.\n\n【12】PG lesions may be precipitated by minor traumas, a phenomenon known as ‘pathergy’. Because of this phenomenon, surgery is not recommended as it may worsen the lesions and delay the healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG lesions—Ichikawa _et al._ described PG lesions appearing at the site of the grounding pad of an electric scalpel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>—this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of PG precipitated by TENS. We hypothesize that in this case the lesions were triggered by the electrical stimulus in a patient in which the underlying UC put her at a higher risk of developing PG.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we present a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus, while also highlighting the challenges that the diagnosis and management of this relatively rare pathology pose to the clinician.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Case reports are waived by the Ethics Committee of our institution.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written consent for publication of the case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DI Costescu Strachinaru.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:55:48", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:56:11", "cost": 23.112}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:56:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:55:47"}

The treatment of nail psoriasis is essential to improve the health outcomes and quality of life among patients. Pain associated with intralesional injections, inadequate penetration into the nail and underlying tissue, poor adherence to therapy, limited efficacy and recurrent relapses are among the many challenging issues with topical therapy. While conventional systemic therapies are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis. We report a case of nail psoriasis improved with treatment by risankizumab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Psoriasis is a widespread chronic skin condition mediated by the immune system. It affects the skin, nails and joints with systemic involvement and has a major negative impact on the quality of life of affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Psoriasis has a global prevalence of 2% with observed regional variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Psoriasis has various clinical manifestations and subtypes, with psoriasis vulgaris being the most common. It classically presents as well-demarcated, erythematous, itchy plaques covered with silvery scales 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis demonstrate nail involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This percentage can reach up to 90% in patients with psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis can impair the quality of life as it may trigger a major social issue, and if left untreated, progress to weaken the nails that can lead to impairment of function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis is challenging to treat and is often resistant to treatment. On the other hand, treating it improves patients’ health outcomes and standard of living 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Nails are known to be epidermal appendages, and are as such, usually affected by psoriasis. Nail disease clinically can involve either the matrix, the nail bed or the periungual tissue, depending on the origin of the inflammatory phase, resulting in distinct injury patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Features such as leukonychia, pitting (punctures or cupuliform depressions), red spots in the lunula and crumbling can result in patients with nail matrix involvement. Onycholysis, salmon or oil-drop patches, subungual hyperkeratosis and splinter hemorrhages may be caused by nail bed involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Psoriasis therapy has advanced tremendously. While conventional systemic therapies as well as intralesional corticosteroids are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, other treatment options are required for a large proportion of patients, with anticipated improvement in effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】There are many challenging issues that we face when treating patients with nail psoriasis which can include: pain associated with intralesional injections, side effects and monitoring of systemic medications, inadequate penetration of topical medications into the nail and underlying tissue and patient adherence to therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【10】We report a case of a 20-year-old male who is not known to have any medical illnesses. He presented with a 2-year history of nail dystrophy and tenderness. It initially involved the left thumb nail then progressed to involve almost all fingernails. Patient denied any history of skin lesions or joint pain. Moreover, no similar history was noted in the family. He visited the primary care clinic where he was diagnosed with onychomycosis based on positive nail culture for candida albicans and treated accordingly with oral terbinafine for 2 weeks then he was given oral fluconazole 300 mg once weekly for 6 weeks. However, no improvement was noted upon follow-up and the patient was referred to dermatology. On examination, bilateral fingernails were found to have trachonychia and longitudinal ridging except the right index and little fingernails . The toenails were clear and no skin or scalp lesions were noted.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Right hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and right hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Left hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and left hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).</u>\n\n【13】A nail biopsy was taken, which showed hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and neutrophils in the nail plate, and came negative for grocott methenamine silver stain . The diagnosis of psoriasis was then made.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Nail biopsy histopathology showing hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and neutrophils in the nail plate (A and B).</u>\n\n【15】The patient was started on subcutaneous adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks with minimal improvement of nail psoriasis after 9 months of treatment. In addition, during adalimumab therapy, the patient developed cutaneous psoriatic lesions over the extremities following the third dose of adalimumab . He was switched to subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg (at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter). Significant improvement was noted at 12 weeks of rizankizumab therapy, where the patient reported 70% subjective improvement of the affected fingernails, with no new involvement of previously unaffected nails, and clearance of skin psoriasis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Round erythematous plaques with overlying white scales developed during adalimumab therapy.</u>\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】It is essential to treat nail psoriasis because of its association with a decreased quality of life and dysfunction in daily life activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Disease control involves patient’s education, avoidance of nail trauma and different therapeutic approaches with physical and pharmaceutical agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The first line therapy in the management of nail psoriasis is topical medications such as corticosteroids, calcipotriol, retinoids and calcineurin inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. However, the efficacy of these medications in nail disease is limited, primarily due to the difficulty of penetrating the nail bed and nail matrix and the lack of patient compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively targets the special human IL-23 p19 subunit without binding to IL-12. Thus, it inhibits pro-inflammatory activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In February 2019, Risankizumab was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis as well as psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Risankizumab is indicated in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Our patient suffered from nail psoriasis with no skin or joint involvement. However, it involved almost all of the fingernails, significantly impairing his quality of life and resulting in significant distress. Therefore, biologic agents were the desirable option by the patient given their efficacy and quick results. Edward _et al._ proposed a practical treatment algorithm for nail psoriasis depending on the number of nails involved and the significance of skin and joint involvement and quality of life impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Similar to our patient’s response to adalimumab, TNF-alpha inhibitors are known to cause paradoxical psoriasis or worsening of pre-existing psoriasis when used for chronic immune-mediated diseases, primarly inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In one study comparing a placebo, ustekinumab and risankizumab, risankizumab demonstrated excellent efficacy with higher Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 rates, along with a convenient maintenance dosing regimen every 12 weeks. Risankizumab was well tolerated, with upper respiratory tract infection being the most frequent adverse event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】This case represents the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in the treatment of nail psoriasis unresponsive to adalimumab. Risankizumab is well-tolerated with a dosing regimen of every 12 weeks. This allows for improved patient compliance and patient satisfaction.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A case report does not require ethical approval in accordance with local guidelines.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the photographs and medical information to be published.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abdulmajeed AlAjlan, Raghda Qasim, Fatimah AlTassan, Tala Qadoumi and Tuqa AlKaff.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:16:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:17:09", "cost": 29.688}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:17:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:16:40"}

We present an interesting, rare case of a spontaneous fistula with acute vision loss in an older patient. The patient was diagnosed with a direct carotid-cavernous fistula based on the clinical and radiological findings. We concluded that early diagnosis and etiological treatment could improve the prognosis of this type of carotid-cavernous fistula.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is characterized by the presence of a low flow fistula, low morbidity and complex clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is commonly insidious and easily misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient was an older woman who exhibited acute visual loss and no other ocular nerve damage. This case report documents her rare clinical manifestations, the completed imaging studies and an uncommon treatment protocol.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 66-year female was admitted with ‘right eye socket distension for one month and sudden blindness for one day.’ One month previously, the patient felt her right eye become slightly swollen and painful but did not receive any treatment. The symptoms occurred repeatedly. The pain in her right eye socket increased slightly and persisted for more prolonged times after three weeks. The vision in her right eye was blurred, and she experienced double-vision one day before being seen at the ophthalmology center. The patient was informed that her eyes were normal, and she was referred to our department of neurology. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, surgical procedures or injury.\n\n【6】The patient's physical examination revealed the following information. Her blood pressure was 184/ 86 mmHg, the left pupil diameter was 3 mm as measured by a pupilometer, the direct light reflection of the left eye was sensitive, and the indirect light reflection was absent. Her vision in her left eye was normal after receiving optometry, according to International Standard Vision Tables. Her right pupil diameter was 4.5 mm. The direct and indirect light reflections of the right eye were absent. The vision in the patient’s right eye was completely lost. The right fundus oculi vein was filled. Both eyeballs did not exhibit conjunctival congestion or exophthalmos and could move freely. The other components of the neurological examination were normal. After being hospitalized, the patient was determined to have elevated blood glucose and lipids.\n\n【7】The computed tomography (CT) scan of the head for this patient was normal. The orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed localized edema of the right optic nerve . The intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicated that the right cavernous sinus’s blood vessels were thickened and tortuous . The cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a small fistula between the meningo-pituitary trunk and the cavernous sinus of the internal carotid artery (ICA), which was drained by the inferior petrosal sinus, and bilateral cavernous sinuses were seen in the mid-arterial location .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Orbital MRI showed local edema of the right optic nerve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Intracranial MRA showed the right cavernous sinus’s blood vessels were thickened and confusion.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 120 mg intravenously once per day. After three days, the methylprednisolone was decreased to 50 mg per day, then stopped after seven days. Her vision gradually improved from no light perception to a 100 cm index (0.1 × 1/5 = 0.02). After being discharged, the patient received finger compression of the right common carotid artery. The compression of the right common carotid artery was performed using two or three fingers placed on the common carotid associated with the lesion until the superficial temporal artery was not visible. Each compression initially lasted no longer than five minutes. This procedure was repeated once after an hour. Gradually, the compression time was extended until the continuous compression time reached 20 to 30 minutes. During the compression, care was taken that the patient did not experience any dizziness, black eyes, contralateral limb weakness or numbness, or other adverse symptoms. Two weeks later, the patient’s vision was improved to three meters (0.1 × 3/5 = 0.06).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Selective right internal carotid arteriogram (positive view) showed a small fistula between dural CCF and peritoneal pituitary artery, and the sinus drainage was through the lower sinus rock.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Bilateral cavernous sinus was visualized in the middle arterial period.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】The incidence of CCF is quite low. The most common cause is trauma, and spontaneous CCF is exceedingly rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This patient presented with chronic symptoms accompanied by acute aggravation. She experienced only eye distention and sudden vision loss without other neurological deficits, which is highly unusual. The patient was confirmed to have a cavernous fistula based on the intracranial MRA and cerebral DSA examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】CCF typically exhibits bulbar conjunctival congestion, edema, exophthalmos and other symptoms. The II, III, IV and VI cranial nerves are typically involved to varying degrees. CCF is easily misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, glaucoma, retrobulbar abscess and other conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of spontaneous CCF is unknown. However, possible causes are thought to include 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> endocrine changes; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> congenital vascular abnormalities, such as dural arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms in the region of the cavernous sinus; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> changes in vessel fragility and degeneration of arterial walls, such as atherosclerosis. Middle-aged and older persons with hypertension, diabetes, abnormal lipid metabolism or other atherosclerotic risk factors that increase vascular wall fragility are at higher risk for CCF.

We present an interesting, rare case of a spontaneous fistula with acute vision loss in an older patient. The patient was diagnosed with a direct carotid-cavernous fistula based on the clinical and radiological findings. We concluded that early diagnosis and etiological treatment could improve the prognosis of this type of carotid-cavernous fistula.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is characterized by the presence of a low flow fistula, low morbidity and complex clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is commonly insidious and easily misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient was an older woman who exhibited acute visual loss and no other ocular nerve damage. This case report documents her rare clinical manifestations, the completed imaging studies and an uncommon treatment protocol.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 66-year female was admitted with ‘right eye socket distension for one month and sudden blindness for one day.’ One month previously, the patient felt her right eye become slightly swollen and painful but did not receive any treatment. The symptoms occurred repeatedly. The pain in her right eye socket increased slightly and persisted for more prolonged times after three weeks. The vision in her right eye was blurred, and she experienced double-vision one day before being seen at the ophthalmology center. The patient was informed that her eyes were normal, and she was referred to our department of neurology. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, surgical procedures or injury.\n\n【6】The patient's physical examination revealed the following information. Her blood pressure was 184/ 86 mmHg, the left pupil diameter was 3 mm as measured by a pupilometer, the direct light reflection of the left eye was sensitive, and the indirect light reflection was absent. Her vision in her left eye was normal after receiving optometry, according to International Standard Vision Tables. Her right pupil diameter was 4.5 mm. The direct and indirect light reflections of the right eye were absent. The vision in the patient’s right eye was completely lost. The right fundus oculi vein was filled. Both eyeballs did not exhibit conjunctival congestion or exophthalmos and could move freely. The other components of the neurological examination were normal. After being hospitalized, the patient was determined to have elevated blood glucose and lipids.\n\n【7】The computed tomography (CT) scan of the head for this patient was normal. The orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed localized edema of the right optic nerve . The intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicated that the right cavernous sinus’s blood vessels were thickened and tortuous . The cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a small fistula between the meningo-pituitary trunk and the cavernous sinus of the internal carotid artery (ICA), which was drained by the inferior petrosal sinus, and bilateral cavernous sinuses were seen in the mid-arterial location .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Orbital MRI showed local edema of the right optic nerve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Intracranial MRA showed the right cavernous sinus’s blood vessels were thickened and confusion.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 120 mg intravenously once per day. After three days, the methylprednisolone was decreased to 50 mg per day, then stopped after seven days. Her vision gradually improved from no light perception to a 100 cm index (0.1 × 1/5 = 0.02). After being discharged, the patient received finger compression of the right common carotid artery. The compression of the right common carotid artery was performed using two or three fingers placed on the common carotid associated with the lesion until the superficial temporal artery was not visible. Each compression initially lasted no longer than five minutes. This procedure was repeated once after an hour. Gradually, the compression time was extended until the continuous compression time reached 20 to 30 minutes. During the compression, care was taken that the patient did not experience any dizziness, black eyes, contralateral limb weakness or numbness, or other adverse symptoms. Two weeks later, the patient’s vision was improved to three meters (0.1 × 3/5 = 0.06).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Selective right internal carotid arteriogram (positive view) showed a small fistula between dural CCF and peritoneal pituitary artery, and the sinus drainage was through the lower sinus rock.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Bilateral cavernous sinus was visualized in the middle arterial period.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】The incidence of CCF is quite low. The most common cause is trauma, and spontaneous CCF is exceedingly rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This patient presented with chronic symptoms accompanied by acute aggravation. She experienced only eye distention and sudden vision loss without other neurological deficits, which is highly unusual. The patient was confirmed to have a cavernous fistula based on the intracranial MRA and cerebral DSA examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】CCF typically exhibits bulbar conjunctival congestion, edema, exophthalmos and other symptoms. The II, III, IV and VI cranial nerves are typically involved to varying degrees.

However, possible causes are thought to include 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> endocrine changes; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> congenital vascular abnormalities, such as dural arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms in the region of the cavernous sinus; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> changes in vessel fragility and degeneration of arterial walls, such as atherosclerosis. Middle-aged and older persons with hypertension, diabetes, abnormal lipid metabolism or other atherosclerotic risk factors that increase vascular wall fragility are at higher risk for CCF. When blood pressure is increased or accompanied by an aneurysm that causes thinning of the blood vessel wall, the blood vessel may rupture, forming a cavernous fistula.\n\n【16】It is highly uncommon in clinical practice to observe only the optic nerve affected in CCF and no other cranial nerves (i.e. III, IV and VI), and no conjunctival congestion, pulsatile exophthalmos or other symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

He could not rotate or bend his neck backward because of the pain; however, he was conscious and did not report a headache or pain on swallowing. Blood tests revealed a high C-reactive protein level (9.68 mg/dl).\n\n【2】A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a strong signal in front of the cervical vertebrae which coincided with the longus colli muscle in the short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) sequence . There was no indication of cervical vertebrae or intervertebral disk inflammation, and an endoscopy ruled out a retropharyngeal abscess.\n\n【3】We diagnosed the patient with acute longus colli muscle tendinitis and prescribed loxoprofen. The pain improved rapidly, which allowed for cervical rotation and backward neck bending. An MRI 1 week after treatment initiation showed a marked improvement of the longus colli muscle swelling hyperintensity.\n\n【4】The longus colli muscle, which functions as the neck flexor muscle, is located anterior to the first–third thoracic vertebrae.

Longus colli tendon calcification has been confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or MRI in 76% of cases and by anterior soft tissue swelling in 79%. This disease is characterized by diffuse longus colli hyperintensity, as observed through T2 or STIR in an MRI.\n\n【7】If a CT/MRI shows diffuse long neck muscle inflammatory swelling with acute-onset neck pain, longus colli tendinitis should be suspected and NSAIDs should be administered.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Editage  for their English language review.</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they do not have a conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have obtained written informed consent from the patient for publication.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:16:07", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:16:35", "cost": 28.041}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:16:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:16:07"}

In this report, we describe a case of large-vessel cerebrovascular thrombus in a therapeutically anticoagulated 89-year-old male admitted with COVID-19 infection. Despite clinical improvement following COVID-19 pneumonitis, symptoms of an acute left-sided total anterior circulation stroke rapidly developed 10 days after initial COVID-19 symptom onset. Computed tomography angiography imaging confirmed acute large-vessel thrombus in the terminal segment of the internal carotid artery resulting in acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Thromboembolic events in the context of COVID-19 infection have recently been described in critically unwell patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of large-vessel thrombus in a patient with COVID-19 infection receiving concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n【2】stroke , neuroimaging , neurology\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】A hypercoagulable state and propensity for thromboembolic disease have been increasingly described in recent reports of patients with COVID-19 infection, yet the exact mechanism driving this remains unclear. Recent discussions in the medical community have focused on the importance of prophylactic anticoagulation where appropriate to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. This report highlights the case of a hospitalized patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who suffered a large-vessel acute thromboembolic stroke despite concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation. It suggests that in those who experience a profound systemic inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there may be an increased risk of prothrombotic events, which may not be entirely attenuated by anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 89-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of worsening dyspnoea and cough. Past history included hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, permanent pacemaker implantation for complete heart block, chronic kidney disease stage 3 and atrial fibrillation. He was taking long-term Rivaroxaban therapy for stroke and systemic embolism prophylaxis. No compliance issues were reported. No antiplatelet or additional antithrombotic medication was being taken prior to hospital admission. Despite advanced age, the gentleman was fully independent with activities of daily living. Hospital admission was required due to hypoxia. Maximal oxygen requirements during the course of admission were 4 l/min. Reverse transcriptase viral polymerase chain reaction testing subsequently confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\n【7】Admission blood testing demonstrated lymphopenia (0.82 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein of 345 mg/l. Coagulation studies were prolonged (activated partial thromboplastin time 31.7 s, prothrombin time 14.4 s) due to concurrent anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban. Fibrinogen level was markedly elevated at 9 g/l. Creatinine (106 μmol/l) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (52 ml/min) were at the patient’s baseline level. Remaining biochemistry results returned within normal limits. Chest radiography confirmed new bi-basal and peripheral left mid zone pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonitis . Oral doxycycline was commenced to cover for possible secondary superadded bacterial infection, in line with local institutional protocols during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography demonstrating bi-basal and peripheral left mid zone pulmonary infiltrates and previous left-sided dual chamber permanent pacemaker (with capped and buried right ventricular lead).</u>\n\n【9】On Day 4 of his hospital stay, and despite an improvement in COVID-19 symptoms with reducing oxygen requirements, the patient developed a rapid and dense left-sided hemiplegia with dysarthria, alongside clinical signs of left gaze palsy and left homonymous hemianopia. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 21, signifying symptoms suggestive of acute severe stroke. Within 1 h of onset of neurological symptoms (Day 4 of hospital admission), computed tomography imaging of the brain was performed. This showed a region of low attenuation in the right basal ganglia and high density in the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery consistent with an acute infarct due to large-vessel occlusion . Computed tomography angiography was requested to evaluate a potential target for mechanical thrombectomy. This demonstrated extensive thrombus occluding the right cervical internal carotid artery and a T occlusion affecting the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography of the brain showing low attenuation in the right basal ganglia and high density in the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography demonstrating thrombus occluding the right middle cerebral artery.</u>\n\n【12】The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy due to concurrent anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban. Mechanical thrombectomy was discussed with interventional radiology colleagues, but it was decided that this would offer little clinical benefit given the patient’s age and comorbid status. Unfortunately, despite maximal ward-based medical treatment, the patient deteriorated and passed away 5 days later.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】This report describes a novel case of large-vessel thrombotic stroke in a recovering COVID-19-positive patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. Emerging evidence suggests the presence of a hypercoagulable state in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, especially those hospitalized with severe illness and strong clinical risk factors for Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recent case series has described large-vessel strokes in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and even thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients despite concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The exact pathophysiology is currently unknown, but it is hypothesized that hypoxia, immobility, excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and diffuse intravascular coagulation could all contribute to these clinically significant events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most have been observed in critically ill patients, with a recent observational study reporting 31% of 184 patients developing thromboembolic disease during intensive care unit stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although this report cannot confirm a causal relationship between COVID-19 infection and large-vessel thrombotic stroke due to the presence of other competing vascular risk factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation), it does offer further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of thrombotic events such as stroke. Additionally, the timing of these events may be unpredictable and unrelated to peak COVID-19 disease severity. Given the acute cerebrovascular event occurred 9 days following symptom onset in this case (not accounting for pre-symptomatic phase of COVID-19), it could be speculated that thromboembolism may be more common in the second half of the COVID-19 disease course (Day 10 onwards), when a systemic inflammatory response reaction has been demonstrated to predominate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this case, the presence of both an elevated C-reactive protein and fibrinogen supports this assertion.\n\n【16】Nevertheless, despite this gentleman receiving concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of systemic thromboembolism, this does not appear to have sufficiently attenuated the increased thromboembolic risk posed by COVID-19 infection. Perhaps, there may be value in screening biochemistry and coagulation studies (possibly at point of admission) to risk stratify and identify those patients at highest risk for subsequent events. Elevated D-dimer levels have been shown to predict future mortality in COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, but a threshold for prediction of thromboembolism has yet be clearly defined. Fibrinogen levels could also be used as a method of prognostication to inform clinical management. Although there are no data in COVID-19 patients, previous studies have demonstrated that elevated fibrinogen levels are predictive of vascular events, including stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Recent reports have proposed higher dose thromboprophylaxis therapy to be used in patients with COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. However, despite some institutions introducing these regimens into local protocols, there remains no randomized data to support a definitive conclusion and to suggest the superiority of one strategy versus another (low molecular weight heparin vs. Vitamin K antagonist vs. direct oral anticoagulant). A perceived protection against thromboembolism needs to be balanced against increased bleeding risk, including intracranial haemorrhage, in these patients. Randomized studies to establish the benefits, or not, of biomarker screening to predict the risk of thromboembolism, and varying anticoagulation strategies, are required to inform best clinical practice in the COVID-19 era.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of interest statement_ .

In particular, mesenteric lymphadenopathy is common among patients with AIDS from conditions such as lymphoma, tuberculosis, other mycobacterial infections and Kaposi’s sarcoma. In addition, patients with AIDS are susceptible to intestinal infections that cause small bowel inflammation and associated lymphoid hyperplasia within the small bowel wall that may also serve as a lead point 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Intussusception associated with obstructive symptoms or bowel ischemia typically requires surgical intervention in adults; however, in shorter segment telescoping (<3.5 cm), there is a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution as was observed in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【6】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【7】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>C.M.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:19:25", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:19:34", "cost": 9.582}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:19:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:19:24"}

It is usually part of benign illness and can occur at any age. Recurrent vomiting can be a symptom of life-threatening medical or surgical emergencies. It can be rarely caused by an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst. Early recognition is essential for preventing delays in management and potential complications.\n\n【2】Here we report a case of an extraluminal pyloric duplication presenting as progressive gastric outlet obstruction cyst in a 14-month-old Syrian boy. The diagnosis was made through abdominal ultrasound, gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography scan.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Vomiting is a common complaint in a multitude of disorders, ranging from gastrointestinal etiologies, central nervous system disease, pulmonary problems, renal disease, endocrine/metabolic disorders, and drugs (either as side effects or in overdosages) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Gastric Duplication Cysts (GDC) in particular are rare causes of pediatrics vomiting. It is accounting for 4% of gastrointestinal tract duplications or roughly 17 per 1 000 000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cystic duplication of the pylorus is scarcely reported, only 2.2% are of gastric origin.\n\n【5】To our knowledge, no more than 50 cases of pyloric duplication have been reported in the literature, most of them were extraluminal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 14-month-old Syrian boy was referred to our clinic for recurrent incoercible, non-bilious vomiting after feeding, 4-6 episodes a day, with abdominal pain and constipation for 1 month. He was born full-term, normal pregnancy without any complications after birth. His birth weight was 4 kg. The parents deny any history of medical ingestion, toxin exposure, trauma, or falls. In his medical history, the boy was diagnosed with patent duct arteriosus (PDA) that surgical ligation at the age of 12 months.\n\n【8】There was no family history of genetic disorders. On physical examination, his body weight was 11 kg (50.79%; _z_ score –1.5 SD), the length was 82 cm (87.49%; _z_ score −2.5 SD), he was vitally stable and generally well. The abdomen was soft with no masses or organomegaly. The patient underwent multiple investigations: Complete blood count (CBC), Blood gas test, Amylase, lipase, renal and liver function, electrolytes, glucose, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Urinalysis, culture, and sensitivity were within normal limits. Echocardiography was normal.\n\n【9】An ultrasound (US) of the abdomen revealed a thick-walled, round cystic mass approximately measuring 3.5 × 3.5 cm which was adherent to the posterior wall of the pylorus, and compressed the pyloric channel, resulting in partial gastric outlet obstruction. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed which showed a narrowing in the outlet of the stomach . An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed cystic mass compressing the pyloric channel . Based on the clinical presentation and radiologic findings, a pyloric duplication cyst was suspected.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed narrowing in the outlet of the stomach.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT showed cystic mass compressing the pyloric channel.</u>\n\n【12】An open laparotomy was undertaken for assessment and cyst removal. At laparotomy, a cystic mass was identified inferior and lateral to the pyloric channel which appeared to compress it, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. The cyst had no communication with the pyloric channel but it shared a muscular wall with the antimesenteric border of the pylorus.\n\n【13】The duplication was resected as well as the common wall and a pyloroplasty was performed .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|A cystic mass measuring ~35 × 35 mm.</u>\n\n【15】Histologic examination revealed gastric mucosa with a smooth muscle coat, which was consistent with a pyloric duplication cyst. No aberrant tissue was identified. The patient was discharged 7 days after surgery, with no postoperative complications. The patient was asymptomatic 4 years later.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Vomiting after feeding in a 1-year-old patient is frequently seen in gastroenteritis (GE), but GE is usually associated with diarrhea, and recurrent vomiting is not usual. The physical examination and laboratory were normal. That can be excluded the systemic infections, metabolic and endocrine causes. There was no medical history. A surgical condition such as a gastric duplication cyst usually presents at younger than one year of age, it is more prevalent in females. Only one-third of the duplications are present in the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】GDC may be associated with various other congenital anomalies like; alimentary tract duplications, genitourinary abnormalities, and an esophageal diverticulum in about 50% of cases, vertebral and spinal cord abnormalities (16–26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In our case, the patient had a corrected cardiac malformation associated with an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst which was the first case described in the literature.\n\n【20】Symptoms of pylorus duplication are non-specific that vary according to the size, site and the type of fluid secreted by their mucosa. Symptoms usually range from a nonobstructing lesion to an obstructing mass, even mimicking infantile hypertrophied pyloric stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient is male and has vomiting with good weight gain at 14-months-old.\n\n【21】The first report on the duplication cyst was by Calder in 1733. However, it was not until 1937 when William E. Ladd introduced the term duplication of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cystic Duplication of the pylorus has an embryonic origin, it probably develops in the sixth week of the embryonic period but the etiology has not been elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】GDC must be continuity of the cyst wall with the stomach and shared in blood supply. It should be no interruption between the smooth muscle layer of the doubling area and the normal intestine. The cyst should have an epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Diagnostic confirmation often requires complementary imaging tests such as US, CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The US is the most common modality used to image duplication cysts. GDC characterizes in US as a ‘double-wall sign,’ delineating the echogenic inner mucosa from the hypoechoic outer rim of muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the current case, US only made a diagnosis and showed an anechoic cystic mass with a double-wall sign.\n\n【23】Treatment of gastric duplication is complete surgical resection due to the risk of malignant transformation. Surgical resection can be performed by open and laparoscopic techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In summary, this was an unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction caused by an extraluminal pyloric duplication cyst in a boy with cardiac malformation. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of using the US to diagnose gastrointestinal duplication cysts.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer, doctors in pediatrics and pediatric surgery departments, and laboratory assistants in Tishreen University Hospital laboratory.

She had no medical history and took no medications. The most prominent symptom was hematochezia. To confirm the diagnosis, colonoscopy was performed. The colonoscopy findings revealed that multiple white round flat elevations in the reddish intestinal mucosal surface extending longitudinally between the sigmoid colon and rectum, and a diffuse circular elevated lesion in the rectum .

This favorable tumor microenvironment helps the transformed cells to undergo further mutations and clonal expansion. Case 1 was a 42-year old female with a 1-year history of a right breast fungating mass which was histologically confirmed to be matrix-producing type of MBC. Case 2 was a 47-year old female who presented with a recurrent left breast mass. Histologically, the tumor was confirmed to be carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. MBC is a rare, heterogeneous tumor with poor prognosis due to its aggressive behavior. It is more likely to mimic other benign breast conditions, therefore contributing to delay of diagnosis as it was for both of our patients herein presented.\n\n【2】metaplastic , carcinoma , breast , chondroid , poor prognosis\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Nonepithelial tumors of the breast generally are rare including benign and malignant types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) encompasses various types including those with mesenchymal-only and combined mesenchymal and epithelial components, and its prevalence is less than 1% of all breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

The mass was fixed to the underlying tissue with ill-defined margins. Incisional biopsy was done and was reported as pleomorphic liposarcoma. Baseline chest and abdominal CT scan revealed normal lungs and intrabdominal organs. Then toilet mastectomy was done. The tumor was extensively necrotic, and it measured 14 × 9 × 11 cm. Seven lymph nodes were dissected from the axillary tail. Histologically, the tumor was composed of areas of epithelial components with almost no tubular formation , areas of mesenchymal and epithelial components separated by a thick fibrous strand  and diffuse proliferation of atypical spindle cells with marked pleomorphism and hyperchromasia . Increased cellularity, atypical nuclei with binucleation of the malignant chondrocytes  and mitotic count of 40 per 10 high power field were also seen. All the seven axillary lymph nodes and the surgical margins were free of the tumor. Pathologic TNM stage T4aN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. Immunohistochemistry staining for ER/PR and HER-2 were all negative. Cytokeratin (CK5/6) was focally positive.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of the tumor cells with almost no tubular formation (H & E stain, ×100), ( **B** ) both epithelial (blue arrow) and mesenchymal (black arrow) areas of the tumor are shown (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic spindle tumor cells with marked hyperchromasia (H & E stain, ×200) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant chondroid matrix.

The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 months after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she remained uneventful for about 6 months, then she developed pleural effusion, wasting and generally worsening of her condition and she died after being confirmed with lung metastasis which was confirmed by chest CT scan. However, cytological analysis of the pleural fluid was not done due to the debilitating condition of the patient.\n\n【10】### Case 2\n\n【11】A 47-year old female presented with a left breast mass for more than 10 years. She reported that she had had lumpectomy done 6 months ago; unfortunately, the excised lump was not sent for histological examination. The patient started experiencing pain from the same breast followed by appearance of a mass not more than 6 weeks after lumpectomy. On physical examination, the left breast was swollen with inverted nipple and ulcerated overlying skin. Baseline CT scan survey of chest and abdomen for metastasis was normal. Radical mastectomy with dissection of three palpable axillary lymph nodes was done. Grossly, the tumor measured 10.5 × 6 × 3 cm and was extensively necrotic.\n\n【12】Histologically, the tissue sections revealed a diffuse, infiltrating tumor composed of atypical spindle cells with extensive necrosis . The tumor cells had marked hyperchromasia and pleomorphism . Brisk mitotic figures  and count of approximately 50 mitoses per 10 high-power field and giant tumor cells were also seen . The conclusion was carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. Pathologic TNM staging of pT4bN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. ER, PR and HER-2 all were negative. CK5/6 was positive in areas with carcinomatous component.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of atypical spindle tumor cells (H & E stain, ×40), ( **B** ) spindle tumor cells which are hyperchromatic with marked nuclear pleomorphism (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic epithelial spindle and ovoid tumor cells and brisk mitoses (H & E stain, ×400) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant ovoid and spindle tumor cells with giant tumor cells (H & E stain, ×400).</u>\n\n【14】The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 weeks after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she became stable. Three months later, chest and abdominal CT scan was done to evaluate for possible metastasis and was found to be normal. Six months post operation, the condition of the patient is stable without metastasis or local recurrence.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】MBC is histologically classified into five subtypes including spindle cell, squamous cell, matrix-producing, carcinosarcoma and osteoblastic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The differential histological diagnoses of MBC include myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma and adenomyoepithelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The median age at presentation for patients with MBC ranges from 48 to 59 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Patients with MBC present clinically with rapidly growing masses usually greater than 2 cm, and such masses are fixed to the underlying tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Zavadil et al. reported that, over 20% of patients with MBC in their study had tumors measuring more than 3.5 cm and fixed to the underlying tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Rarely patients with MBC present with axillary lymph node metastasis, and the incidence has been reported to range from 6 to 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that accurate diagnosis for MBC is low. Li et al. and Zhang et al. reported that only 11.8 and 20% of the patients in their studies had accurate diagnosis before mastectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgery is the main stay of treatment of MBC. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be used based on the stage of the disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been found to decrease both the rate of recurrence and mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Single institution retrospective studies and genomic profiling reported that MBCs are highly chemoresistant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Because of being almost triple negative and at the same time chemoresistant, MBCs have very poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one study, the 5-year overall survival for MBC compared to IDC-not specified type was 67.9% and 88.9%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The presence of benign heterologous element, absence of intervening stroma and predominating carcinomatous component are good prognostic factors, whereas the presence of sarcomatous metaplastic elements including chondroid, osteoid and intervening spindle cells along with lymph node metastasis and tumor size are poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The importance of reporting these two cases in this paper is that the two cases have shown that MBC is more likely to occur in females who are below the median age (over 50 years). Additionally, the presentation of MBC in our cases should always be considered as it was that initially, the disease was presenting as benign, which contributed to the delay of diagnosis in both cases.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】MBC carries a very poor prognosis due to its aggressive biological behavior accompanied with resistance to chemotherapy, increased chances of recurrence and metastasis.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are thankful to the radiologists and surgeons for their invaluable contribution for furnishing us with necessary information we needed in the process of writing this paper.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest to be disclosed.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was provided by the Institution Review Board of the School of Biomedical Science which is under Makerere College of health Sciences.

Although some soft tissue sarcoma such as myxofibrosarcoma sometimes show direct invasion to these barriers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, synovial sarcoma seldom shows such direct invasive pattern to barriers, much less the greatest barrier like an intermuscular septum. Moreover, in the patients with synovial sarcoma, wide-margin surgery with even though thin barriers resulted in good local control rates. Although synovial sarcoma usually cannot show such a local invasive pattern, a relatively indolent tumor growth might allow for such unfamiliar development of a tumor, even against a robust barrier. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported such unique extension of a synovial sarcoma beyond the intermuscular septum. We believe that these radiological and pathological findings have a huge impact to sarcoma surgeons. Surgeons should be aware of the potential vulnerability of the intermuscular septum. A careful preoperative examination is warranted to obtain a safe margin in sarcoma surgery.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication, and gave their consent.

To prevent colonic perforation, cauterization was performed to the depth where SEMS was exposed.

After APC cauterization, the patient had no complication such as bleeding and perforation. On the seventh hospital day, he started oral intake and had no recurrent symptoms.

When malignant colorectal obstruction occurs, it is treated with SEMS, transanal ileus tube and colostomy. Although SEMS insertion is an effective treatment, there are complications such as perforation, stent obstruction and migration. SEMS obstruction leads to abdominal pain and vomiting, and prevents patients from undergoing chemotherapy. Therefore, SEMS obstruction should be relieved as soon as possible. Secondary stent-in-stent SEMS insertion is effective for the obstruction. Yoon _et al_ . reported that secondary stent-in-stent SEMS insertion was attempted in 36 cases and successfully placed in 27 cases with a median stent patency of 170 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, Kwon _et al_ . reported that peritoneal carcinomatosis was a risk factor for early SEMS obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Therefore, in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, early stent obstruction may occur and treatments other than stent-in-stent SEMS insertion should be considered.\n\n【13】APC is a non-contact high-frequency coagulation technique, which uses argon gas. It is effective for treatment of many gastrointestinal diseases, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and precancerous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. APC is also used for treating malignant gastrointestinal obstruction. Kofoed _et al_ . reported that APC was a safe treatment for obstruction by gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although our patient had no obvious peritoneal carcinomatosis, stent patency time was short at 82 days. Because there was a risk that stent re-obstruction occurred in a short period of time, we chose APC treatment. Stent patency time was 62 days and comparable to first SEMS patency.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Abdominal X-ray. Improvement of the obstruction was confirmed.</u>\n\n【15】Complications of APC include rectovaginal fistula, pneumatosis intestinalis and perforation. Colonic perforation by APC, which is a rare complication, has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u> and we should be cautious about it. Norton _et al_ . reported that APC-induced injury correlated with duration of burn, power setting and total energy delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, to remove tumor with APC, a certain level of power setting and duration of burn is required. To prevent perforation, we propose a method for APC cauterization based on the exposure of metallic stent. When cauterization extends deep into the tumor, the risk of perforation may increase. Therefore, we remove only the tumor that has grown in the stent, such that cauterization is performed to the depth where SEMS is exposed.\n\n【16】The advantage of APC treatment is that it can be a preventive treatment even if the patient has no symptoms or stent obstruction is partial. Moreover, when the partial obstruction occurs again after treatment, we can repeatedly treat it with APC. However, there are few reports of this, and the average patency period after treatment is unknown. On the other hand, APC treatment is not suitable for patients who have complete stent occlusion. If complete bowel obstruction is present, stool will flow to the anal side when the obstruction is released, which may make additional APC cauterization difficult. Therefore, if patient has complete SEMS obstruction, stent-in-stent SEMS or ileus tube insertion is preferred.\n\n【17】In conclusion, APC may be an effective treatment for SEMS obstruction. If SEMS obstruction is partial, APC will be a treatment option. APC treatment is effective but needs further studies to assess the safety of the above treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Teruaki Inoue is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【7】day, he received colonoscopy ", "content": "【0】ABSTRACT\n--------\n\n【1】Self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) have often been used to treat malignant colorectal obstruction.

In her medical history, the girl was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 8 years before by MEFV mutation. The patient’s symptoms were controlled by colchicine (0.07 mg/kg/day) with the last attack a year ago. Upon physical examination, the patient was alert, without distress, and all her vital signs were within the normal average. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-distended, non-tender abdomen. The abdominal radiography showed a radiopaque foreign body in the right lower quadrant . As the physical exam was normal and the foreign body was not causing obstruction, it was predicted that it will pass through spontaneously without any complications and the patient was discharged with instructions for getting abdominal X-rays as an outer patient for follow-up. A week later the patient had episodes of colicky abdominal pain around the umbilicus without any other symptoms. There were not any remarkable signs in the abdominal examination except for a mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant.

The white blood cell count was 8500 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> , differential count polymorphs 45%, lymphocytes 50% and platelets (PLT) 450 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen were normal. Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant, which was in the same location that the prior abdominal radiography showed. An abdominal ultrasound scan was requested which revealed highly echogenic, the linear metallic foreign body within a slightly swollen appendix .\n\n【13】Because the pin was trapped in the appendix with difficultly to pass through and to avoid further complications such as inflammation or perforation, the patient was taken up for surgery. During surgery a sharp pin was found to be trapped in the appendix with no signs of inflammation or perforation. The procedure completed as prophylactic appendectomy .\n\n【14】The patient was discharged the next day after surgery, with no postoperative complications.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Most of the FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously within a week and do not cause any complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

When the foreign body remains in the right lower quadrant in serial abdominal X-ray, an appendicular foreign body should be highly suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Although FBs in the appendix are rare, different kinds of foreign bodies have been reported to be trapped in the appendix, and most of them are found to be radiopaque.\n\n【21】An appendicular foreign body can be classified into high-risk and low-risk depending on the ingested object. High-risk FBs are found in 75% of the cases and include sharp, long or pointed, while low-risk are found in 12% of the cases and include blunt, round objects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. The appendicular foreign body carries a risk of developing appendicitis, peritonitis, perforation, hemorrhage or an abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Due to this, an appendectomy is performed with or without any sign of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case, the patient had a history and diagnosis of FMF. She came with episodes of colicky abdominal pain without any clinical or laboratory signs of FMF attack. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound appeared linear metallic foreign body trapped in the appendix. The determination of surgical intervention was based on ultrasound, which revealed the foreign body in the lumen of the appendix regardless of physical examination to avoid complications in the upcoming future, and a prophylactic appendectomy was done.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the medical officer and doctors in pediatric and pediatric surgery departments for the consent for publication and the laboratory assistants in Tishreen Hospital Laboratory.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this study.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report did not require review by the ethics committee of Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WRITTEN INFORMED\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

She had been complaining of intermittent palpitations and limited exercise tolerance. Clinical examination revealed a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and a split second heart sound. Electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary stenosis with a peak velocity of 3 m/s, peak gradient of 37 mmHg and mean gradient of 22 mmHg; however, the PV was not well visualized.\n\n【3】CMR revealed the unusual appearance of a quadricuspid pulmonary valve (QPV) with four cusps of almost equal size . The leaflets were mobile with moderate-severely restricted central opening (valve area 0.9–1 cm <sup>2 </sup> ) and moderate flow acceleration . There was also mild pulmonary regurgitation. The PV annulus was non-dilated. The main and left pulmonary arteries were moderately dilated (32 and 28 mm, respectively), with high-normal right pulmonary artery dimensions (21 mm).

NBTE is strongly associated with malignancy and can also be associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

We report a case of a patient with previously undiagnosed NBTE who presented with multi-organ systemic thromboembolism despite pre-existing treatment with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old man with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation and previous lower limb deep vein thrombosis presented at hospital with a 1-day history of transient left-sided arm paraesthesia in the absence of chest pain. His regular medications included apixaban 5 mg twice daily and digoxin 125 micrograms daily. He was normotensive, had a resting heart rate of 105/min and was afebrile. A systolic murmur was noted over the aortic area without radiation to the carotid area. There were no clinical signs of cardiac failure. Neurological examination demonstrated normal upper and lower limb tone, power, reflexes, sensation and coordination. Splinter haemorrhages were noted in his fingernails .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Splinter haemorrhages</u>\n\n【7】The patient is an electrician by occupation and there was no history of tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption or recreational drug usage. There was no family history of prothrombotic disorders, and he did not have any prior investigation for prothrombotic disorders when he was diagnosed with an unprovoked deep venous thrombosis 2 years prior.\n\n【8】His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, with no acute ischaemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle with mild global impairment of left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction of 45%). Serial high-sensitivity troponin I levels were elevated (320 ng/l and 288 ng/l, normal < 20 ng/l). Serum biochemistry, renal and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was 6.5 mg/l (normal < 5.0 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm/hour (normal 2–25 mm/hour).\n\n【9】Coronary angiography revealed slow flow in the distal LAD artery suggestive of a coronary artery embolism . Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated numerous foci of restricted diffusion, including two in the right parietal vertex and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere, consistent with embolic stroke . The intracranial cerebral arteries demonstrated normal flow and were of normal calibre. Suspecting an intracardiac source of embolism, the patient underwent transoesophageal echocardiography. This revealed a broad-based vegetation (14 mm at the base and 9 mm in thickness) attached to the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, with several frond-like mobile elements and moderate aortic valve regurgitation . There was no left atrial appendage thrombus. In the absence of septic features, NBTE was suspected. A procoagulant screen revealed strongly positive lupus anticoagulant tests (Russell’s viper venom and tissue thromboplastin inhibition) and elevated β2-glycoprotein antibodies (91 CU, normal 0–19). The patient had normal anti-cardiolipin IgM and IgG levels (<1 and 18 CU, respectively, normal 0–19 CU). Anti-nuclear antibody titre was positive (1:160; speckled and homogenous), but no other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus were present. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any evidence of malignancy nor pulmonary embolism. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was within normal limits (61 U/l, normal 20–70 U/l), although lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated (301 U/l, normal 120–250 U/l). Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation was normal, with no evidence of paraproteinaemia.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Coronary angiogram (cranial view) demonstrating slow antegrade flow (incomplete filling) in the left anterior descending artery (red arrow) compared with normal opacification of the left circumflex artery (red asterisk), suggestive of coronary artery embolism.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Brain magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion weight imaging) demonstrating multi-territory foci of restricted diffusion, including two in the right parietal vertex ( **A** ) and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere ( **B** ), consistent with embolic stroke.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Transoesophageal echocardiography: Long-axis views of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve in systole ( **A** ) and diastole ( **B** ) showing an echogenic mass in the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve (indicated by asterisk).

Because of the risks of recurrent systemic embolism, the patient underwent surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic aortic prosthesis. A small vegetation noted on the P2 scallop of the mitral valve was also carefully excised. Pulmonary vein cryoablation and amputation of the left atrial appendage was performed. Histological examination of the excised aortic valve revealed hypocellular fibrinous material with organizing thrombus, and no evidence of acute inflammation, consistent with NBTE. Bacterial cultures were negative. Histological and cytogenic examination of a sampled mediastinal lymph nodes did not demonstrate any features of sarcoidosis or lymphoproliferative disease. He was commenced on warfarin postoperatively (target INR 2.0–3.0). The patient made an excellent postoperative recovery and suffered no further thromboembolic events.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】APS is a hypercoagulable state associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic and embolic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This patient had recurrent venous thromboembolism as well as NBTE, complicated by embolic ischaemic stroke and coronary artery embolism. Antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to mediate valvular damage by promoting the formation of fibrin-platelet thrombi on altered valve surfaces, which results in NBTE, often appearing as verrucous lesions on left-sided heart valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Whilst atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of systemic embolism, the absence of left atrial appendage thrombus and the presence of an aortic valve vegetation, suggests that his cardioembolic stroke was secondary to APS.\n\n【16】Unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin are recommended in the acute setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, although the optimum long-term strategy is uncertain. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are less effective than warfarin in preventing recurrent thromboembolism in randomised-controlled trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. A recent meta-analysis of four studies comparing DOACs to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with APS demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis (odds ratio 5.17), no increased risk in venous thrombosis and no difference in risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. VKAs remain the guideline-recommended treatment of choice in antiphospholipid syndrome, although current data do not specifically include patients with NBTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The role of surgical valvular intervention is uncertain. Surgical valve replacement or vegetation excision with valvular repair may be performed for significant valvular dysfunction or to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. In a contemporary cohort study of 42 patients, 10 patients (24%) underwent cardiac surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and 7 of them did not have a history of malignancy. The prognosis of patients who underwent cardiac surgery without a history of malignancy was found to be excellent, whereas 3 patients with cancer-related NBTE all died within 2 years of surgery.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case is exempt from ethics approval at our institution.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from this patient and is available for review upon request.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Justin Phan.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:02", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:17", "cost": 14.602}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:02"}

It affects mainly adults between 60 and 70 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Histopathologically, the tumor combines the criteria of two distinct benign tumors: hamartoma, which is mixt of different tissues composing a normal bronchus, and chondroma, which is a tumor of cartilaginous cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the largest series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, the sex ratio was 6.1 (37 men, 6 women) and 86% of patients were symptomatic with recurrent respiratory infections, central airway obstruction (mimicking COPD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and hemoptysis (30%). Bronchoscopy generally provides the diagnosis thanks to biopsies but is also, in case of endoluminal presentation, the only treatment. If endoscopic resection is not complete, surgery can be proposed with the aim to be as conservative as possible. Local recurrence is generally low. In the series of 43 patients published by Casío _et al._ , a recurrence occurred in four patients. This should deserve an endoscopic follow-up even though malignant transformation has not yet been described for this type of tumor unlike pure chondroma, which has the potential to evolve to chondrosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【5】With this clinical case, we aimed to show that debulking of endotracheal hamartochondroma, using interventional bronchoscopic techniques, is feasible, effective and safe, and to demonstrate the diagnostic challenge of rare tracheal hamartochondroma masquerading as COPD.\n\n【6】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【7】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:16", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:24", "cost": 8.351}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:16"}

Endocarditis caused by AD has been reported to result in heart failure, septic embolization and destruction of the valve despite use of appropriate antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the only case of AD endocarditis without any identified entrance route; requiring replacement of pulmonary, mitral and aortic valve due to extensive valvular damage and large vegetations.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Abiotrophia species, previously known as nutritionally deficient streptococcus (NDS) was first identified in 1961 by Frenkle and Hirsh in a case of sub-acute infective endocarditis (IE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. NDS was initially classified as Streptococcus Defectiva and Streptococcus Adjacens and later their names were changed to Abiotrophia Defectiva (AD) and Abiotrophia Adjacens. AD is gram-positive cocci, although coccobacilli and bacilli forms may occur, depending on the culture medium.\n\n【4】AD is a part of the normal flora of oral cavity, urogenital and intestinal tracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It has been associated with a variety of serious infections including bacteremia, septic arthritis, brain abscess and IE, pancreatic abscess, osteomyelitis and crystalline keratopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. AD affects diseased valves in 90% of cases and it is notorious for embolic complications and valvular destructions despite being sensitive to antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Previous studies have shown a relapse rate of as high as 17%, despite antibiotic use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of Aorto- Right ventricular (RV) fistula and multiple valve endocarditis caused by AD.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 41-year-old male originally from West Africa with a questionable history of ventriculoseptal defect (VSD), presented with worsening exertional dyspnea and palpitations, loss of appetite, lower extremity edema and a 30 pounds weight loss over 6 weeks. On admission, his temperature was 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure of 104/50 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination was significant for chronically ill cachexic male with a BMI of 21 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , jugular venous distension, bilateral rales, tachycardia, RV heave and 4/6 pan-systolic murmur with a palpable thrill throughout the precordium. Blood cultures were obtained for suspected endocarditis and empiric intravenous antibiotics were started. An initial transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a large mass attached to the aortic valve leaflet measuring 3.2 × 0), severe aortic regurgitation with holodiastolic flow reversal in the aorta , mass attached to the flail anterior mitral valve leaflet resulting in severe mitral regurgitation , mass attached to pulmonic valve, significant pulmonic regurgitation  and severe pulmonary hypertension with Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure of 65 mm Hg. Additionally, dilatation of the aortic root along with fistula between the aortic sinus and the RV outflow tract was seen . Within 24 h, blood culture revealed gram-positive cocci in two out of two bottles, subsequently identified as Abiotrophia species. Patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further management. He underwent right heart catheterization demonstrating elevated filling pressures, low cardiac index and shunt fraction of 2.1. Emergent surgery revealed an aortic root abscess. He underwent prophylactic grafting of the left anterior descending coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery as the left main coronary Os was close to the aortic annulus. Patient also underwent bio-prosthetic pulmonary and mitral valve replacement, closure of the congenital VSD and closure of aorto-RV fistula using bovine pericardial patches in addition to an aortic root replacement with porcine root prosthesis. Post-operatively, patient developed atrial fibrillation and was subsequently started on amiodarone therapy. He was on intravenous penicillin and gentamycin during his hospitalization. Transesophageal echocardiogram, post intervention, revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45% and competent bio-prosthetic valves. Repeat blood cultures remained negative and patient was discharged on intravenous vancomycin via peripherally inserted central catheter.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Holodiastolic flow reversal in aorta.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to pulmonic and aortic valves</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 8:|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to mitral valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 9:|删除段之间换行|3D Transesophageal echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to the mitral valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 10:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing possible flail mitral valve and large vegetation attached to aortic valve.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 11:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 12:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 13:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 14:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 15:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 16:|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiogram showing fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.</u>\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】AD is a rare cause of endocarditis. However, few studies have estimated that AD is responsible for 5–6% of all cases of IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. AD is usually isolated from an immunocompetent host and is a very important cause of blood culture negative IE. It is often seen as a satellite lesion around other bacteria that secrete pyridoxal such as Staphylococcus. AD requires pyridoxine and Vitamin B6 for growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. AD is difficult to identify as it has unique nutritional requirements, is pleomorphic, and is a very slow growing organism. A rapid, yet simple and inexpensive method to identify AD is by using MALDI-TOF-MS (Matrix associated laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometer). AD endocarditis carries higher morbidity and mortality than endocarditis caused by any other streptococci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Multiple factors that add to the virulent nature of this organism are secretion of exopolysaccharide, ability to adhere to fibronectin and a special affinity for endovascular tissue. IE due to AD is also attributed to the preexistence of prior or congenital heart disease and has been reported to cause native and prosthetic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Despite of the use of appropriate antibiotics, AD endocarditis is known to cause serious complications leading to heart failure, septic embolization and destruction of the valves. The recommended antibiotic treatment for AD endocarditis consists of penicillin or ampicillin with gentamicin for 4–6 weeks, according to the American Heart Association guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. _In vitro_ antibiotic susceptibility does not reflect clinical outcome. Heart failure is the most serious complication of endocarditis that often requires valve replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Aggressive treatment becomes essential with development of complications, with ~50% of the patients eventually requiring surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our patient, due to a definite embolization potential of the large vegetation and extensive multivalvular damage, a pulmonary, mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery was performed. A multi-disciplinary team comprising of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, infectious disease specialists and intensive care specialists contributed to the favorable outcome.\n\n【27】In general, Aorto-RV fistulas have been described to occur because of rupture of congenital and acquired sinus of Valsalva aneurysms. Other reported causes that result in aorto-RV fistula include blunt or penetrating chest trauma, aortic dissection, high ventricular septal defect repair and aortic valve surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report of AD endocarditis requiring replacement of pulmonary, mitral and aortic valves. This case also stands unique, as it demonstrates an association between Aorto-RV fistula and AD Endocarditis. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of Abiotrophia endocarditis that involved the aortic, pulmonary and mitral valve without an identified entrance route.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Supplementary material is available at _Oxford Medical Case Reports_ online.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:00:58", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:01:17", "cost": 19.238}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:01:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:00:58"}

It is frequently used to evaluate for vitreous hemorrhage, foreign bodies, retinal detachment, optic neuritis and posterior vitreous detachment; however, it can also be used to evaluate for a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). A POCUS can reveal a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface, and this is referred to as a retrobulbar ‘spot sign’ (RBSS). We present the case of an 88-year-old male that presented to our community ED with a painless loss of vision to his right eye. A POCUS revealed an RBSS of the central retinal artery and he was subsequently diagnosed with a CRAO. At his 1-month follow-up, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision, however, remains with significant visual impairment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis. Research has shown that within 90–100 min of infarction, the retina begins to develop permanent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>.

This type of cerebral vascular accident has a mean age of 60–65 years, with over 90% of the cases involving patients over the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 88-year-old male presented to our emergency department (ED) with an acute onset of a painless loss of vision to his right eye. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (on apixaban). He stated he was lying in bed reading when he had a sudden painless loss of vision to his right eye, described as a curtain closing, for which he presented to our ED ~24 h later. He denied any other symptoms including headache, scalp pain, jaw claudication, focal weakness, numbness, angina or shortness of breath.\n\n【6】Vitals on arrival to the ED were as follows: 36.9°C, heart rate of 62 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, blood pressure of 123/53 mmHg and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. His cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. His neurologic exam was notable for a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of +2 for complete unilateral vision loss to the right eye. Intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg bilaterally. His remaining physical exam was notable for a right afferent pupillary defect (APD). To further assess the eye and its structures, a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was then performed. Utilizing the high-frequency linear probe to the right eye, a transverse view demonstrated a retrobulbar spot sign (RBSS) in the distal portion of the central retinal artery within the optic nerve sheath . He had normal blood flow in his left eye , and no blood flow was seen to the central retinal artery of the right eye, with the yellow arrow pointing to the RBSS . The patient was then transferred to our tertiary referral center (TRC) for specialist consultation.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Transverse view using the high-frequency linear probe of the right eye; arrow demonstrates RBSS within the optic nerve sheath.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Normal retinal blood flow in left eye; ( **b** ) CRAO with no blood flow seen to the central retinal artery or retina in right eye, yellow arrow highlights RBSS.</u>\n\n【9】Ophthalmology visualized a plaque on the dilated fundoscopic exam with associated retinal ischemia. Given the onset of ~24 h prior to arrival, the risks of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) outweighed the benefits, as such, the patient was medically managed. His head computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable for acute changes. A magnetic resonance imaging MRI could not be done, secondary to his pacemaker not being compatible. His carotid duplex was without severe stenosis or thrombus. His echocardiography showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, which was similar to previous studies.\n\n【10】Overall, his workup was without evidence of carotid artery disease or vasculitis and it was suspected to be cardioembolic in origin related to his atrial fibrillation. On further questioning, it was found that the patient’s family member had passed away 2 weeks prior, leading to depression and multiple missed doses of his anticoagulation. Compliance of his anticoagulation was stressed on discharge. At his 1-month follow-up after his hospital admission, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】A CRAO is a rare presentation in the ED; however, it is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis which requires a high index of clinical suspicion. The clinical presentation of a CRAO in the ED typically involves a patient with an acute, painless unilateral loss of vision, with the possibility of temporal sparing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The pertinent differential diagnoses for acute painless vision loss include optic neuritis, central retinal artery/vein occlusion, retinal detachment, temporal arteritis and atypical/complex migraines, to name a few. Optic neuritis may present with painful eye movements and temporal arteritis may have associated craniofacial pain despite the neuropathy being painless.\n\n【13】The ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies the central retinal artery. The central retinal artery provides blood supply to the inner retina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An acute occlusion of the central retinal artery results in ischemia to the inner retina, which may appear pale and edematous.\n\n【14】On the physical exam, patients may have an APD. A fundoscopic exam may show a ‘cherry red spot’, with a pale retina that is seen in ~90% of patients, or ‘box car segmentation’ that is seen in ~15% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For many causes of acute painless loss of vision in the ED, a dilated fundoscopic exam has been considered the gold standard. However, not many emergency physicians feel comfortable performing this, especially in a setting without ophthalmology coverage and with potentially limited resource settings. Alternatively, ultrasound (US) can provide a rapid and useful diagnostic tool.\n\n【15】A US of the eye can be performed at the bedside to evaluate for blood flow and for a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface. When this density is seen, this is referred to as the RBSS and can indicate the type of embolism responsible for clinical symptoms. This RBSS is the actual clot responsible for the loss of vision; it is likely a cholesterol and fibrin clot that occludes the ophthalmic artery and retinal blood supply 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. RBSS on US been seen in up to 51% of CRAOs and is found to have 100% specificity for thromboembolic CRAO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. When present, RBSS has been shown to have a poor long-term prognosis, and visual symptoms are poorly responsive to thrombolytics or other therapeutic interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. If an RBSS is not visualized, other etiologies for CRAO should be considered and evaluated. An ocular US can also be used to assess for blood flow in the central retinal artery and vein using color Doppler imaging. In the setting of CRAO, there will be reduced or no blood flow in the central retinal artery in the affected eye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. CRAO is considered a stroke-equivalent, so patients in the ED should undergo further evaluation and be admitted for risk factor modification.

Various maneuvers are often attempted for patients presenting within 24 h of symptom onset. Techniques include ocular massage (direct and intermittent pressure over a closed eyelid for 10–15 s at a time with a rapid release to facilitate a pressure gradient that could potentially dislodge any embolism) and anterior chamber paracentesis (this allows for an acute decrease in intraocular pressure that could dislodge any embolism). Medications include intraocular pressure lowering agents (topical timolol, intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol), vasodilatory agents (e.g. nitroglycerin) and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Overall, little data exist to show that any of the above methods will improve the patient outcomes compared with observation alone, with some evidence showing they may actually worsen the visual outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Further, no clinical trials have demonstrated any improvement compared to the observation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Other potential treatment modalities include the use of thrombolytics. Since a CRAO is a vaso-occlusive phenomenon, there has been interest in using tPA, with some published reports showing some improvement; however, it is not considered as the standard of care and is considered as an unproved benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

She had 400 mL bleeding during the obstetric event requiring vaginal packing gauze due to superficial mucosal bleeding. Her clinical course was uneventful. Unfortunately, venous doppler ultrasonography was not available to us at the time, and therefore pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was used empirically, after weighing the risk of increased bleeding and the risk of VTE.

The aneurysm was treated successfully. Six years later, however, she presented with a progressive _en coup de sabre_ deformity, leading to the diagnosis Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS), a rare diagnosis characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones and often associated with various non-specific intracerebral abnormalities. In this patient retrospective analysis of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging imaging indeed revealed intracerebral calcifications and aspecific white matter lesions. Remarkably, in this patient the giant intracranial aneurysm turned out to be the presenting symptom of PRS years before the characteristic facial deformities became apparent.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS) is a slowly progressive syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones. It is a heterogeneous disorder with an incompletely understood pathogenesis. Several etiologies have been proposed, including auto-immunity, vascular dysfunction, trauma, infection, autonomic dysfunction, neural crest migration disruption and a possible genetic predisposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PRS is suggested to be part of a larger disease entity, which encloses linear scleroderma en coup de sabre as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most frequent systemic manifestations of PRS are neurologic, affecting up to 20% of patients. These neurological symptoms include seizures, migraines (sometimes leading to hemiplegia), brain atrophy, cranial neuropathies, intracranial aneurysms and other intracranial vascular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Ophthalmologic abnormalities include enophthalmos, uveitis, retinal vasculitis, ptosis and abnormal ocular movements due to muscle paresis or weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Dermatologic, cardiologic, auto-immune, endocrinologic and infectious manifestations have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There seems to be a female predominance in patients with PRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Radiological abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PRS patients include aspecific white matter lesions, mild cortical thickening, intracerebral calcifications and/or atrophy and leptomeningeal enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】We report a 10-year-old girl who presented with symptoms of a right abducens nerve palsy. Except for intermittent headaches, occurring approximately once every month, there were no other clinical symptoms. Neurological examination showed no other abnormalities, including normal ophthalmoscopy. A small intradermal capillary hemangioma was observed on the right upper eyelid.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Giant intracranial aneurysm at the siphon of the internal carotid artery.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Magnetic resonance angiography at presentation showing the giant intracranial aneurysm and onset ectasia of the left carotid siphon.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Right occipital intracerebral calcifications on preoperative CT.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4:|删除段之间换行|Preoperative MRI showing white matter lesion in area of CT calcifications, possible vascular degenerative (developmental venous angioma).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5:|删除段之间换行|One and a half years after surgery.

She was referred for neurosurgery, where balloon occlusion of the aneurysm was performed successfully.\n\n【18】Postoperatively, we observed minimal right sided ptosis and slight difference in pupil size, the right pupil being smaller . The patient complained of headaches along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, which was successfully treated with carbamazepine for 6 months.\n\n【19】On routine check-ups, a progressive en coup de sabre deformity was noted on the right forehead, where originally the hemangioma was located . Retrospectively, the brain CT showed right occipital intracerebral calcifications . Furthermore, the brain MRI showed white matter lesions in the area of these intracerebral calcifications, possible vascular degenerative (developmental venous angioma) . The patient still complained of right sided migraines. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PRS was made 6 years after surgery.\n\n【20】Currently, the patient is 20 years old. Routine yearly check-ups including brain imaging show a slight progression of the hemifacial atrophy, unchanged appearance of the occluded aneurysm and no expansion of intracranial calcifications and white matter lesions . Furthermore, no additional aneurysms have been found.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】PRS is a rare syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones. While symptoms are mostly neurological, various other organ systems can be affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 – 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Intracranial aneurysms in PRS are rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 10 \\]</u>. In these cases, the patients were already diagnosed with PRS years before aneurysm development. By contrast, in our patient, the initial symptom was a right abducens nerve palsy caused by an intracranial aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The diagnosis PRS was only made a few years later, when the hemifacial atrophy became more apparent. Both the hemifacial atrophy and the intradermal capillary hemangioma were located on the right forehead, but the location of the hemangioma did not fully correspond with the extent of the atrophy. Therefore, the atrophy cannot be explained by the presence of the hemangioma.\n\n【24】To our knowledge, this is the third report describing an association between PRS and intracranial aneurysms in childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Bosman _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> describe a 10-year-old patient with a giant intracranial aneurysm and two additional smaller intracranial aneurysms. Schievink _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> report a patient with PRS who had multiple and progressive intracranial aneurysms that required treatment at the age of five, 12 and 21 years old.\n\n【25】In conclusion, there might be an association between PRS and intracranial aneurysms and a intracranial aneurysm can be the presenting symptom of PRS. In case of a intracranial aneurysm in PRS, these aneurysms can be multiple and progressive, therefore regular follow up is advised.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank our patient for her consent to publish the case and the related pictures.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was taken from the patient for publication of the case report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient's written consent was taken for publication.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>L.A.

Although imaging may be helpful for diagnosis, fistulae are often difficult to identify. An 81-year-old woman presented with mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral pneumonia and hepatic cyst infection with air-fluid levels. After mechanical ventilation, abdominal CT showed increased air in the hepatic cyst. The drainage bag for the hepatic cyst infection was also inflated by positive pressure ventilation, suggesting a possible HBF. The ventilator was adjusted to minimize pressure on the fistula and prevent retrograde infection. The fistula eventually closed spontaneously. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and continuous drainage resulted in improvement of the hepatic cyst infection; however, the patient died due to respiratory complications. HBF should be suspected when positive pressure ventilation results in increased air at the hepatic infection site.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A hepatobronchial fistula (HBF) is a rare complication of several hepatic diseases; no previous case reports have described HBF associated with hepatic cyst infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An HBF is diagnosed by imaging and identification of clinical symptoms such as abdominal infection and respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; it is important to minimize pressure on the fistula through drainage or other means 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the case of ventilator management, positive pressure ventilation is required, making management even more difficult. We report the first case of hepatic cyst infection complicated by an HBF, diagnosed based on both characteristic computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings. Appropriate ventilator settings, as well as drainage management, eventually resulted in fistula closure.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 81-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, that had lasted for one and a half months. She has been diagnosed with an asymptomatic hepatic cyst previously . On examination, her body temperature was 36.1°C, blood pressure 116/77 mmHg, pulse 100/min and respiratory rate 25/min, with an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 86% on reserved mask at 10 L/min. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, and the abdomen was slightly distended. Laboratory examination results were as follows: white blood cell count, 16 100/μl; C-reactive protein, 14.52 mg/dl; AST, 24 U/L; ALT, 12 U/L; ALP, 465 U/L; γ-GTP, 91 U/L; T-Bil, 1.2 mg/dl and D-Bil, 0.4 mg/dl. Chest and abdominal CT showed bilateral consolidation in the lungs and a large cystic lesion with air in the right hepatic lobe .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT 5 years prior to admission showing a cyst in the right hepatic lobe.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal and chest CT at admission showing a cyst containing air-fluid levels in the right hepatic lobe measuring 106 mm × 103 mm, and bilateral consolidation in the lungs.</u>\n\n【8】She was intubated and treated with positive pressure ventilation, vasopressors and antibiotics (tazobactam/piperacillin and clindamycin). The PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio after intubation was 142 (positive end-expiratory pressure 7 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O), and the patient was considered to have moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Contrast-enhanced CT (8 h after the first) showed an increase in air in the hepatic cyst  and a potential connection between the hepatic infection site and peripheral bronchus . We performed percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage (PTAD) and obtained 400 ml of creamy pus, and observed no leakage of contrast agent into the thoracic cavity . In addition to CT findings, the drainage bag was inflated by positive pressure ventilation; this led us to believe that the patient had an HBF. The ventilation settings were adjusted to apply minimal pressure in order to prevent the drainage bag from inflating, while preventing retrograde infection with positive pressure ventilation.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Abdominal enhanced CT reveals a rapid increase of air within the hepatic cyst; ( **B** ) Abdominal enhanced CT showing disruption of the continuity of the wall of the hepatic cyst; the fluid component is continuing to the pleural cavity (red arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|PTAD does not show any contrast agent leakage into the chest cavity.</u>\n\n【11】Cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were positive for _Escherichia coli_ ; this also supported the diagnosis of a HBF. We changed the antibiotics to cefazolin and metronidazole on Day 4; the fistula was considered to be clinically closed on Day 5, as the drainage bag was no longer inflated. Blood and sputum cultures were negative on Day 9. CT showed a reduction in the size of the hepatic lesion , and her respiratory condition gradually improved. However, CT on Day 12  revealed mediastinal emphysema. Due to concerns regarding the possibility of exacerbation of the mediastinal emphysema with positive pressure ventilation and improvement of the PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio, she was extubated on Day 13. However, her respiratory condition worsened, and she was unable to withstand further invasive procedures. After discussion with her family, we halted invasive treatment on Day 16, and she died on Day 18.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT shows a reduction in the size of the hepatic cyst infection.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 6**|删除段之间换行|Chest CT showing mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Hepatic cysts are asymptomatic and typically require no treatment. However, treatment is necessary when complications occur. Treatment strategies for infection include antibiotics, percutaneous drainage and surgical interventions. Initial independent antibiotic therapy fails in 70% of cases, eventually requiring percutaneous drainage or surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The mortality rate is relatively low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>; however, complications due to HBF led to poor outcomes in our case. This case shows that patients with hepatic cysts are at risk of developing HBF due to infection.\n\n【16】There are five categories of HBF: congenital, hepatic hydatid disease or liver abscess, biliary tract obstruction secondary to tumors, injury and iatrogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Few cases are caused by infection, which accounts for 10% or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A search of literature does not reveal any cases of hepatic cyst infection leading to HBF, although there are several case reports on HBF due to liver abscess, unrelated to hepatic cyst infection.\n\n【17】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are useful for the detection of fistulae. CT and magnetic resonance imaging are also useful diagnostic tools, although they can fail to detect the fistulous tract itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, we suspected HBF based on CT findings. A definite diagnosis was made based on the fact that the drainage bag inflated due to positive airway pressure, and the cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were the same, although PTAD did not reveal the fistula. There are no case reports on drainage bag expansion due to positive pressure ventilation; this finding will be useful for future practice.\n\n【18】There is currently no standard treatment for HBF. Maintaining low pressure at the opening of the fistula is vital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This can be accomplished by drainage, which may be accomplished by using a chest tube, ERCP, PTC or by surgical excision of the fistula tract. Clinicians prefer less invasive and non-surgical treatment, because the recovery rate is higher than that with traditional surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in refractory cases, traditional surgery is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, appropriate antibiotic treatment and drainage by PTAD were administered for the infected hepatic cyst; the patient responded well to the therapy. Ventilator settings were adjusted, and the fistula was considered to be clinically closed, because the drainage bag was no longer inflated by positive pressure ventilation. However, the patient had moderate ARDS at the time of initial treatment, and despite guideline-recommended respiratory management, she died due to progressive ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. If the presence of the fistula itself is detrimental to the condition, early surgical intervention may be necessary; however, surgery was not performed in this case owing to the severity of the disease and the vulnerable health of the patient.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained for publication of the data in this article.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hatsuo Isogai.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:29", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:38", "cost": 8.436}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:28"}

Thus, in this report we present a rare case of ALK-negative ALCL (ALK–ALCL) that was described and diagnosed in a 13-year-old girl in the mediastinum.

Clinical examination revealed large masses in the mediastinum causing symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome. Blood examination showed WBC count 6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocyte count 48%, neutrophil count 42%, hemoglobin count 85 g/L and CRP 117.\n\n【8】Chest radiography revealed an abnormal shadow in the mediastinum extending to pulmonary hilar region . Furthermore, CT scan demonstrated large masses in the anterior mediastinum  with no other masses elsewhere. Thus, our patient underwent surgery on 30 July 2018 for complete resection of the mediastinal lesions to remove the symptoms. Gross examination revealed that the resected masses were 10 enlarged Lymph nodes measuring 3–7 cm. Microscopic examination revealed cohesive sheets of diffuse large pleomorphic cells effacing the nodes architecture , characterized by abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei with abnormal mitotic figures and Reed–Sternberg-like cells . Thus, differential diagnosis included ALCL, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL), peripheral T-Cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|A chest radiography demonstrates an abnormal shadow in the mediastinum extending to the pulmonary hilar region.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT scan of the upper thoracic region demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes (Black Arrows) in the anterior mediastinum.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|H&E sections of resected lymph nodes demonstrating: (A and B) cohesive sheets of diffuse pleomorphic cells effacing the nodes architecture; (C and D) neoplastic cells characterized by abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei with multiple abnormal mitotic figures in addition to Reed–Sternberg like cells</u>\n\n【12】Immunohistochemical stainings showed strong CD30 positivity for large and Reed–Sternberg-like cells , whereas CD15, CD3, CD20, ALK, CD45Ro and EMA were negative .

It constitutes nearly 15% of pediatric NHL and 2% of all NHL. Furthermore, about 15–20% of ALCL cases affect patients under 20 years old mostly males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>, our rare case, however, was described in a 13-year-old female.\n\n【19】According to the revised fourth edition of the WHO classification 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u>, ALCL is defined as a CD30-positive neoplasm of T or null cell lineage, as these tumors are distinguished by their anaplastic cytology and constant membrane expression of CD30 antigen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are two subsets of ALCL: Primary cutaneous ALCL which is confined to the skin, and Systemic ALCL that affects all organs mostly the lymph nodes, with involvement of extra nodal sites including bone marrow, skin, soft tissues, lung and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The mediastinum is involved in ~10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and as it is a common site in CHL, we have faced more challenges adding CHL to differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】Furthermore, systemic ALCL is categorized into two main subtypes according to the expression of a protein called ALK: ALK-positive ALCL which constitutes 50–80% and is more common in young adults with a survival rate of 70–90% for 5 years, while ALK-negative ALCL represents 20–50% and tends to affect older adults with a worse prognosis and a survival rate of 40–60%. Male predominance (60%) is seen in both subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diagnosing ALCL can be challenging. Cytomorphologic findings, immunohistochemistry and clinical data were critical as there are certain similarities between ALCL, Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and DLBCL. These features include the proliferation of large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm and large atypical nuclei. And this gives an essential role for immunohistochemistry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Morphologically in ALCL, we see cohesive sheets of large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped nuclei surrounded by an inflammatory background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Neoplastic cells resemble Reed-Sternberg cells raising the difficulty in differentiating it from CHL.\n\n【24】However, CHL lacks cohesive growth pattern and has classical Reed–Sternberg cells with an inflammatory background and band-like fibrosis. Likewise, DLBCL can be distinguished with its large B-cells lineage, while PTCL-NOS is recognized with small clusters of epithelioid histiocytes resembling granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In addition, IHC stainings for ALK, CD30, CD3, CD15, CD20, CD45Ro and EMA are valuable in the differential diagnosis. In ALK–ALCL, cells show strong positivity for CD30, usually in Golgi region and at the cell membrane. Our case also showed negativity for CD15 excluding CHL. Without forgetting negativity for CD20 and EMA excluding DLBCL and negativity for CD3 and CD15 excluding PTCL-NOS.\n\n【26】Molecularly, detecting ALK protein correlates with a chromosomal translocation that involves NPM gene on chromosome 5q35 and ALK gene on chromosome 2p23. Furthermore, ALK+ALCL is characterized by overexpression of HIF1-a target genes as well as interleukin10 and H-ras/K-ras induced genes, while ALK–ALCL is enriched for TMOD1, TNFRSF8, GATA3, MYC, IRF4 target genes and PI3K pathway-regulated genes. Studies also revealed that DUSP22 and P63 rearrangement were present in 30% and 8% of ALK–ALCL cases respectively, but absent in ALK+ALCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, molecular testing has been largely replaced by immunohistochemistry. In addition, these tests were not available in our country, thus the diagnosis was based on immunohistochemical and cytomorphologic findings.\n\n【27】Furthermore, although studies showed correlation between the presence of ALK/Ki1 antigen and young ages, our case was ALK-negative presenting in a 13-year-old patient.\n\n【28】In conclusion, diagnosing ALK–ALCL represented a hard challenge due to rarity of presenting in young ages, male predominance and difficulties in diagnosis. However, with proper immunohistochemical stainings and detailed cytomorphologic observation, diagnosis was confirmed in our case.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Confict of Interest statement\n-----------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent Form was obtained from the patient’s guarantor (Patient’s father).

This organ replacement technique provides additional benefits beyond just resting the kidneys, evacuation of excess fluid, but also helps clear lactate and harmful inflammatory mediators. Moreover, coupled with the adsorption method using an innovative adsorbent coating agent on the filter, it is able to increase the clearance of unwanted interleukins, which were previously difficult to remove due to their intermediate molecular weight.\n\n【4】CASE SERIES\n-----------\n\n【5】Based on the frequencies and characteristics described in Table 1 , most of our admitted patients were male and were in the range of 18–65 years.\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Frequencies and characteristics\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|Frequencies and characteristics\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n| Variables . | . | Frequency ( _n_ ) . | Percent (%) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Male | 20 | 80 |\n|  | Female | 5 | 20 |\n| Age (years) | 18–65 | 15 | 60 |\n|  | \\>65 | 10 | 40 |\n\n【12】All of our observed 25 patients admitted to ICU in December–January 2021 were diagnosed of ARDS due to the Delta type of COVID-19. Of the 25 patients, 13 managed to survive on additional combination therapy between standard therapy with additional hemofiltration/adsorption using Oxiris™ and plasmapheresis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Combined therapy effect of standard care and hemofiltration technique in COVID ARDS survivors.</u>\n\n【14】The standard therapy that is carried out employs conservative fluid management and active fluid removal with negative balance cumulative, ventilator strategy with PEEP 5–12 targeting SpO2 92–95%, early feeding, antimicrobial stewardship without ECMO, prone positioning or intravenous immunoglobuline.\n\n【15】Of the 13 surviving patients, the average length of stay was 8.8 days, whereas the length of use of the ventilator was 5.2 days . This appears to be better than the 12 patients who did not survive, with the average day of death being the seventh and eighth days.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Since its inception in the 1970s, CKRT has come a long way beyond its original intended use. The so-called Extracorporeal Blood Purification has expanded the scope of CKRT that, initially, only focused on the kidney to become an extensive effort to purify blood from unwanted waste products and inflammatory mediators. This purification role becomes prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, where mechanical anti-inflammatory therapy is needed to improve the condition of immune system dysregulation but still maintain hemodynamic stability in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendation on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, it is recommended to administer low tidal volume (4–8 mL/kgBW) with a target oxygen saturation of 92–96%, high PEEP use to improve oxygenation, traditional recruitment lung maneuvers, prone position for 12–16 hours and continuous use of muscle relaxants may be considered to achieve the desired ventilation target. An extracorporeal therapy and nitric oxide inhalation is also recommended in supporting facilities. Excess fluid is also avoided to ensure the lungs remain dry so as not to exacerbate the inflammation that interferes with ventilation and oxygenation. However, the excessive inflammatory parameter still needs to be removed by purification systems such as CKRT and plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Unfortunately, its unavailability in many requiring hospitals and the equipment high cost makes this tool rarely accessible to those who need it. Plasmapheresis method is attempted as an intermediate option in this cost issue. Therefore, the starting point for dissemination of this external purification technique is not only based on CKRT but has incorporated plasmapheresis into it.\n\n【20】As seen in Fig. 2 , as many as seven patients received CKRT, whereas six patients received plasmapheresis. The adsorbent (Oxiris™) was used in seven patients taking CKRT, whereas the remaining six remained on plasmapheresis, and all of them continued to receive standard therapy. The other 12 patients did not get the same opportunity for CKRT and plasmapheresis due to financial problems and availability of filters.\n\n【21】Looking into the analysis of adsorbent types in Fig. 3 , we found that those survivors with Oxiris™ discharged earliest from the ICU, and the other two types such as M100 and plasmapheresis were discharged later. This simple analysis could emphasise more on the important role of early CKRT to remove cytokine in critical COVID-19 patients. Although based on the recent retrospective, a multicenter, descriptive study included 83 patients with CRS from three hospitals in Wuhan, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> CKRT significantly reduced the inflammation; however, it did not decrease the fatality rate of patients with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Therefore, the choice of CRRT indication, dialysis time and dialysis mode should be more careful and accurate in COVID-19 patients with CRS.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Kaplan–Meier survival analysis on the adsorbent type.</u>\n\n【23】Unfortunately, a small sample size, absence of specific cytokine examination and large bias of therapeutic variation, unclear baseline patient history are the weaknesses of our case series. Conclusions could not be drawn specifically from this series, but it could show the potential dual use of CKRT to manage a cytokine storm.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Yohanes W.H.

This report presents an interesting case of this rare skin condition developing in a male patient following a diagnosis of stroke.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 87-year-old gentleman was admitted to our stroke rehabilitation unit following a right partial anterior circulation ischaemic stroke. The patient had a past medical history of hip osteoarthritis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, asthma and angina; no previous dermatological conditions were noted.\n\n【6】One month after the stroke, the patient developed a widespread maculopapular, blanching rash to the trunk and limbs. This was accompanied by petechial lesions on the dorsum of the feet. It was thought to represent a possible allergic rash and spontaneously resolved within 3 weeks.\n\n【7】A month following this episode the patient developed vesicular lesions on the palmar aspect of both hands . He then went on to develop two large bullae measuring 5 × 3 cm and 8 × 4 cm over his left foot and over the following days more bullae appeared over both feet. These were tense and most were haemorrhagic . He did not develop any blisters elsewhere and there was no mucosal involvement. Punch biopsy of a vesicle appeared to show an intra-epidermal lesion; however, the roof comprised of necrotic keratinocytes and it was commented that this could represent re-epithelialization of a sub-epidermal blister . Prominent eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate was noted in the superficial dermis, with extravasation of red blood cells. No sample for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was taken as the patient was reviewed at a peripheral site out of hours. Serum skin autoantibodies were found to be positive at a titre of >1/320 for pemphigoid and supported the clinical diagnosis of BP.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Vesicles appearing 1 month after the stroke.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Tense and haemorrhagic bullae appearing on feet.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|The biopsy showed an intra-epidermal vesicle with a necrotic roof; the underlying dermis showed numerous eosinophils.</u>\n\n【11】The patient was started on an ultra-potent steroid cream (1 application once daily), emollients and long-term treatment with oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). Within a month the skin lesions resolved and the patient was able to once again participate in stroke-specific rehabilitation. Post-treatment titre was not evaluated as this is not routinely done at our institution.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】The immunopathogenesis of BP involves the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against two proteins: dystonin, also known as BP antigen 1 (BPAG1), and type XVII collagen, known also as BP antigen 2 (BPAG2), of 230 and 180 kDa, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Both are adhesion junction plaque proteins within the hemidesmosome, which anchors the basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane. When these proteins are targeted there is separation at the dermo-epidermal junction, with the formation of sub-epidermal blisters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】DBP is a clinical variant of BP distinguishing feature of which is the initial or persistent palmoplantar localization of the lesions. Bullae or vesicles can be haemorrhagic in nature, and purpuric lesions are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; as in the case described, some patients might have prodromal symptoms, mainly eczematous or papular eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis includes mainly dyshidrotic eczema, which presents with smaller and typically non-haemorrhagic vesicles, but also palmoplantar pustulosis, bullous tinea infection, scabies infection, contact dermatitis, bullous lichen planus and T-cell lymphoma. DBP is typically confirmed by skin biopsy, demonstrating sub-epidermal bullae and eosinophil infiltration, and DIF to show linear deposits of IgG along the dermo-epidermal junction. Treatment is dependant on disease severity. Topical steroids are often sufficient in mild disease and can be used in combination with oral tetracyclines as in this case. Oral steroid therapy is often required and systemic immunosuppression may be needed to wean steroid dose. Although skin lesions are not usually life-threatening, BP is associated with a 6–41% mortality at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】DBP has been associated with neurologic, psychiatric and cerebrovascular disorders. There are only three cases reported in the literature of DBP in patients with a past history of stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>; however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous case has been reported of DBP developing immediately after a cerebrovascular event. Stroke as a risk factor for developing BP has been studied in the literature. Shen _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> demonstrated with a large-scale population-based study that the hazard ratio of BP was significantly higher in stroke patients compared with the control group. The hypothesis behind this correlation is that damage to the blood‑brain barrier in stroke generates autoantibodies that cross-react with BPAG1/BPAG2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Interestingly, the inverse relationship might also be true: patients with a history of BP have a 2-fold increased risk of developing stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. BP patients seems in fact to have a dysfunctioning endothelium, as demonstrated by their higher serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the E-selectin, and this has been considered a risk factor for developing cerebrovascular events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusions, we presented a case of DBP developing after stroke. More studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between these two clinical entities. DBP should be considered in older patients presenting with blistering lesions to the hands and feet, particularly when haemorrhagic.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors confirm that the research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Daniele Fanelli.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:56:14", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:56:27", "cost": 12.543}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:56:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:56:13"}

Presentation beyond childhood, however, is rare. We report, here, the case of a woman in her 50s who presented with an acutely obstructed posterolateral diaphragmatic hernia. The initial physical exam and radiological results could have led to an erroneous diagnosis of pneumothorax. We wish to emphasize the importance of having a high index of suspicion for this condition when cases with similar gastro-respiratory symptoms are encountered.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDHs) are a common entity with an incidence of one in 3000 births. The late fusion of the oesophagus and the septum transversum during development underlies the vulnerability for the development of CDHs. Ninety percent of CDHs are reported to involve the posterolateral aspects of the diaphragm as described by Bochdalek in 1848. Bochdalek hernias (BHs) are very rare beyond childhood with an incidence of 0.17% and are often incidentally discovered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Symptomatic hernias are misdiagnosed in up to 38% of cases leading to unnecessary interventions such as chest tube insertion or failure to diagnose which could lead to strangulation of the herniated content and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A woman in her 50s presented to our Emergency Department with a 5-day history of dull abdominal pain and vomiting which later started to be associated with streaks of blood. Two days before presentation she developed breathlessness which was aggravated by food intake and associated with intermittent episodes of dry cough and wheezes. She had no chronic conditions, had no surgery or trauma and was not taking any long-term medication. On examination, she was dyspneic and unable to lie flat. Her oxygen saturation was 94% on 4 L/min of oxygen. She had a respiratory rate of 30/min, a heart rate of 107/min and a blood pressure of 177/100 mmHg. She was afebrile. Chest physical examination revealed a hyper-resonant percussion note on the left side with decreased air entry and bilateral wheezes. Her abdomen was distended with a tympanic percussion note.\n\n【6】INVESTIGATIONS\n--------------\n\n【7】Her lab investigations showed total white blood cells count of 10.2109/L, heamoglobin 12.1 g/dl; renal and liver functions were within normal range. Her electrolytes were potassium 2.5 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L and her Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Her initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left-sided air-fluid level with a circumferential opacity and mediastinal shift to the right side; there was an initial impression of tension pneumothorax . But given the patient’s hemodynamic stability and radiologist advice, a computed tomography (CT) thoracic scan followed that showed a large left diaphragmatic hernia with the stomach and the spleen inside the left chest cavity causing significant mass effect with the result of total lung collapse .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CXR showing left-sided air fluid level.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|CT Thorax showing herniation of the stomach and spleen in the left chest cavity.</u>\n\n【10】DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n----------------------\n\n【11】The patient initially exhibited acute gastrointestinal symptoms pointing to an acute abdomen because of abdominal pain, vomiting and distension. The presentation to the hospital was associated with respiratory distress symptoms and signs on examination which could have led to a clinical misdiagnosis of tension pneumothorax at the early stages, but the patient’s hemodynamic stability allowed performing the CXR. The follow-up CT scan advised by the radiologist confirmed the diagnosis of an obstructed diaphragmatic hernia which would explain both the respiratory and gastrointestinal presentation.\n\n【12】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【13】Following the CT scan and confirmation of diagnosis, a nasogastric tube was inserted. This drained 1.5 L of fluid over 2 h with a large quantity of air. A considerable improvement in the patient’s respiratory distress was noted with the respiratory rate normalizing and a follow-up CXR showed a dramatic reduction in the size of the intrathoracic stomach with a matching lung re-expansion . She was brought to the operating room the following morning after appropriate resuscitation and electrolyte correction. The chest was entered via a seventh intercostal space leftposterolateral thoracotomy revealing a 5-cm defect in the left dome of the diaphragm with an incomplete hernia sac with the stomach, greater omentum and spleen incarcerated inside the chest cavity . Adhesions were released and the stomach, omentum and spleen were reduced into the abdominal cavity. The defect was primarily closed in two layers (double breasting). The patient was sent home on the fifth post-op day following an uneventful recovery. She was seen 6 weeks later and was doing well.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|CXR Post nasogastric tube suction with marked left lung re-expansion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Left posterolateral thoracotomy revealing herniated spleen, stomach and greater omentum.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】In their systematic review, Brown _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> showed that 78% of symptomatic BHs occur on the left side similar to our case. A precipitating factor such as pregnancy, chronic constipation and rigorous physical activity can be found in 25% of symptomatic patients, none were found in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Half of the patients present acutely with symptoms such as pain, pressure sensation in the abdomen or the chest, and symptoms of obstruction or pulmonary symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As these symptoms are ubiquitous, additional clinical clues would include postprandial respiratory symptoms, abdominal or thoracic symptoms aggravated by the supine position and abdominal symptoms aggravated by physical effort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The results of the physical exam in our case gave rise to a diagnosis of pneumothorax. This highlights the importance of a careful analysis of the patient’s symptoms. The most common radiological modality used to diagnose CDH is the CXR followed by the CT scan, which is the most accurate modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Nasogastric tube decompression is a common initial management step in obstructed Hiatal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Using the same approach here improved the patient’s symptoms and allowed the surgical procedure to be performed in more of a semi-elective setting. It is proposed, though rarely, that rupture of the hernial sac may be the initiator of the progression towards a symptomatic hernia. That could have been the case with our patient as a herniated incomplete sac was found. It is recommended to repair any diaphragmatic hernias discovered, irrespective of the symptoms. We used primary repair in our case. Brown _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> found that primary repair was the most performed with no reported recurrence.\n\n【18】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【19】Obstructed Bochdalek hernias rarely exhibits symptoms in adults and should be suspected whenever gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms intertwine to avoid potentially disastrous consequences.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:53", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:44:49", "cost": 116.334}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:31", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:44:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:51"}

Rare complications of this procedure include haemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumonia, mediastinitis and pericarditis (Asano F et al. Complications associated with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration: a nationwide survey by the Japan Society for Respiratory Endoscopy. _Respir Res_ 2013;14:50). I report an unexpected fracture of the tip of the EBUS-TBNA needle as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring during attempted insertion into a subcarinal node.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a relatively new procedure for assessing hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. It is generally safe, with a high degree of specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

I report an unexpected event of the EBUS-TBNA needle tip snapping as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring during sampling of an enlarged subcarinal lymph node. After successful retrieval of the broken needle, the EBUS-TBNA sampling was completed using a new needle _._ Neither the patient suffered harm nor any damage occurred to the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man had wedge resection and mediastinal nodal clearance for a T2aN2M0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe, in November 2012. The patient declined a completion lobectomy. Hence he was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. He previously had excision of a T3N2M0 rectal cancer followed by chemotherapy, and was living with a long-term colostomy. No local or distant metastases from his rectal cancer were identified through more than 4 years of follow-up.\n\n【6】In November 2015, his surveillance contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed enlarged pre-carinal and sub-carinal lymph nodes, with the sub-carinal node showing central necrosis .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT scan image showing the enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes with central necrosis.</u>\n\n【8】He had an EBUS bronchoscopy under sedation (midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg intravenously). The enlarged sub-carinal node was identified. Unexpectedly, the EBUS transbronchial sampling needle (22 gauge; Cook <sup>® </sup> , USA) hit a cartilage ring in right main bronchus just below the carina, and snapped, with a 15 mm broken end of the needle left stuck in the bronchial wall. The EBUS bronchoscope and the long part of the needle were removed _._ A video bronchoscope was introduced and the broken needle was retrieved by forceps _._ The patient was given top-up intravenous sedation with 2 mg midazolam and 50 mcg fentanyl and the EBUS procedure was completed using a new needle. The samples confirmed nodal recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma. Hence the patient was referred to the oncology service following a review of histology in the lung cancer multi-disciplinary team meeting.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】The first case of EBUS-TBNA needle breakage was described by Özgül _et al._ in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The accident had occurred while the needle was moved back and forth for sample collection during the third pass, following its successful introduction into the lymph node. In the current report, however, the needle broke at the first attempted pass as it hit a bronchial cartilage ring. Furthermore, the bronchoscopist was not aware of using excessive force, which might have caused the needle to break.\n\n【11】A recent national survey from Japan included 7345 EBUS-TBNA procedures, and reported a number of rare complications of EBUS-TBNA including bleeding, pneumothorax, infection such as pneumonia and mediastinitis, lignocaine toxicity, pericarditis and breakage of the EBUS bronchoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this survey, breakdown of the needle during EBUS-guided mediastinal node sampling was reported in 0.2% procedures only. However, it is not clear from the report whether these cases involved a complete break of the EBUS-TBNA needle, similar to the case described above, or simply had a minor kink in the needle, which sometimes does happen during sampling. The authors also did not further elaborate the outcome of the small number of procedures complicated by accidental needle breakdown or fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Fortunately in the case described here, there were no complications such as any harm to the patient or the EBUS bronchoscope getting damaged due to needle breaking in the right main bronchus. The patient remained stable post-bronchoscopy and was discharged the same day.\n\n【13】The bronchoscopist subsequently noted that the needle had snapped very close to the junction between the long, shiny electroplated portion and the coarse end of the needle , and wondered whether this junction is a relatively weak point along the length of the needle. Özgül _et al._ in their report had also noted the site of breakage close to the junction between the shiny long portion and the coarse short end of the needle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|The 15 mm tip of the EBUS-TBNA needle showing the site of fracture close to the junction between the long, shiny electroplated section and the coarse distal end.</u>\n\n【15】This unexpected event was discussed in the lung cancer multi-disciplinary team meeting and a report was filed on hospital's dedicated incident reporting website. The needle identifier number and batch number were noted and forwarded to the company supplying EBUS-TBNA needles to our endoscopy unit. The fact the needle had snapped close to the junction between the long shiny part and the coarse end bit was also highlighted, as this may represent a weak point in the needle's structure requiring further investigation.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding to report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required as the events described were part of routine service.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent from the patient uploaded.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>S.

We present a 60-year-old man with a tender left-sided neck mass due to a ruptured aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Cultures taken intraoperatively grew _Salmonella enterica_ ser Dublin.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Infection with _Salmonella enterica_ usually results in a self-limited gastroenteritis characterized by fever, diarrhea, and less often nausea, vomiting and headache. However, according to CDC data, ~8% of laboratory confirmed cases are complicated by bacteremia, arteritis, meningitis and osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Occasionally, extraintestinal infections result in infected or mycotic aneurysms. In the USA, _Staphylococcus_ is the most common organism associated with mycotic aneurysms, whereas _Salmonella_ is much more common in East Asian countries such as China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Mycotic aneurysms associated with _Salmonella_ infection rupture over 50% of the time and if untreated have a mortality ranging from 16 to 44% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Thus, prompt recognition and treatment are key to improved patient outcomes. We report the first published case of a middle-aged man who developed a carotid mycotic aneurysm due _S. enterica_ ser Dublin, a serovar that is usually associated with cattle (ground beef and unpasteurized milk).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer (treated with docetaxel ~2 weeks prior to presentation), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on rivaroxaban) and right knee osteoarthritis (status post total knee replacement) presented to the emergency room with left sided neck pain and swelling. He first noted left sided neck pain 1 to 2 weeks prior to presentation. Initially, he noted some discomfort and a small nodule on his left neck. However, the nodule grew over time and the pain progressed to the point where he noted discomfort with swallowing and breathing. Accordingly, he presented to our medical center for care. On the day of admission, he was febrile (38.7°C), tachycardic 通用删除7(英):<u>(122)</u>, hypertensive (152/94). Fortunately, despite the tender neck swelling, there was no airway compromise.\n\n【6】The physical exam revealed a tender non-pulsatile mass on the left neck extending to the angle of the mandible. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck with contrast revealed a focal outpouching of the left carotid artery . There also appeared to be a mass encircling the left carotid artery (4.3 cm × 2.5 cm × 3 cm) with lateral displacement and compression of the left jugular vein.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|CT scan (coronal) of neck with contrast showing thrombosed aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery (arrow)</u>\n\n【8】A vascular surgery consultation was obtained and given concern for a contained ruptured aneurysm, the patient was taken to the operating room (OR). During the surgery, an aneurysm with a posterior perforation and contained rupture was noted . Pathological specimens from the surgical site were notable for significant atherosclerotic disease. Also, purulence was noted along with extravasated blood and cultures taken from intraoperative specimens revealed pan sensitive _S. enterica_ ser Dublin. The affected and ulcerated portion of the carotid artery was excised and replaced via end-to-end anastomoses with a bovine mesenteric vein graft. Interestingly, all peripheral blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. He was treated with ceftriaxone 2 grams IV daily for at least 6 weeks.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Perforated posterior wall of the left internal carotid artery seen intraoperatively (arrow)</u>\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】We report the case of a middle-aged man who presented with a subacute painful neck swelling that was due to a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the left carotid artery. Given his history of cancer, a malignant metastasis was among the differential diagnoses. However, CT imaging helped us to quickly narrow the list of possibilities.\n\n【12】The concern for a ruptured aneurysm prompted a vascular surgery consultation and ultimately surgical exploration. The aneurysm was found to be infected with Salmonella. Mycotic aneurysms of the carotid artery are relatively rare and those due to _Salmonella_ spp. are even rarer. Our review of the literature revealed ~22 published cases of a carotid mycotic aneurysm due to _Salmonella_ spp. Mycotic aneurysms tend to involve the aorta causing aortitis with or without aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only ~5% of mycotic aneurysms involve the carotid artery. In general, male gender is a risk factor for development of mycotic aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Other risk factors include age >50, diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Our patient had many of the traditional risk factors. He was also fully anticoagulated while the aneurysm was developing and had recently been treated with chemotherapy. We suspect that these factors likely contributed to his presentation as well.\n\n【13】We did not identify a discrete episode of gastroenteritis or bacteremia. He had been taking chemotherapy ~2 weeks prior to presentation so typical symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting might have been misattributed to medication side effects. There are a few published case reports of mycotic aneurysms due to Salmonella with negative blood cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. This may reflect the fact that gram negative bacteremia is frequently transient.\n\n【14】The standard management of mycotic aneurysms is open surgical repair. There are multiple case reports describing an endovascular approach, but studies comparing endovascular versus open repairs are lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A minimum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy is often recommended although there are no data to support a specific duration of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The Maryland State Health Department performed the microbiological testing in this case and confirmed the Dublin serotype, which usually causes gastroenteritis in both cattle and humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There are very few case reports of mycotic abdominal aneurysms due to the Dublin serotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of carotid mycotic aneurysm associated with the Dublin serotype. Although most _Salmonella_ spp outbreaks have been linked to eggs, poultry and occasionally pet reptiles, outbreaks due to _S. enterica_ ser Dublin have been linked to the consumption of contaminated ground beef and raw or unpasteurized milk. The Centers for Disease Control reported an outbreak of the Dublin serotype in 2019 that involved eight states. The outbreak was linked to ground beef 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】This case report brings into focus several important clinical and epidemiological points. First, an infected aneurysm should be considered in the differential diagnosis for a patient who is febrile and presents with a tender neck mass. Second, since mycotic aneurysms frequently rupture, prompt referral to a vascular surgeon is paramount. Finally, since our patient likely contracted _S. enterica_ ser Dublin from ground beef or milk, it is imperative that we continue surveillance for this organism in our environment.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This Case Report does not require IRB approval as it is not considered research and does not contain any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A signed written consent was obtained from the patient for this case report.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Adrien L.

Clinical examination showed negative results, while abdominal ultrasound revealed a 16-mm right pyelic stone. Urinalysis performed on 12 December 2020 revealed leukocyturia and microhematuria. On 16 February 2021, the consentient patient underwent ESWL. The early post-operative course was uneventful. Thirty-six hours after the procedure, she experienced a fever with rigor and chills and progressive onset of lumbar pain. Home therapy with oral cefixime was unsuccessful, and she was re-admitted to the hospital 7 days after ESWL (23 February 2021). Increased white blood cells (11 600/μl), serum procalcitonin (19.84 ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (14.72 mg/dl) were detected. Hemoculture was positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing _Escherichia coli_ , resistant to beta-lactamine and ciprofloxacin. Abdominal computerized tomography showed the unmodified stone. Hydronephrosis was not detected. Intravenous perfusion of gentamycin and co-trimoxazole allowed resolution of the sepsis in 5 days. The patient continued to take oral co-trimoxazole for a week after hospital discharge. In the meantime, the lumbar pain increased in intensity, which led her to consult a neurosurgeon at our university hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (23 February 2021) showed spondylodiscitis at levels L3, L4, L5 , which was treated with a cycle of parenteral antibiotics according to the modality described above. The patient was also fitted with an orthopedic brace, which gave complete relief of pain in 1 month. She was made aware of the possible occurrence over time of clinical and imaging features of lumbar stenosis as a consequence of vertebral and discs post-spondylodiscitis deformity. Weight loss and swimming were recommended. Eighteen months after ESWL, the patient was asymptomatic and presented only a modest limitation of lumbar spine motility. Regarding the stone, the patient, free from colic, refused to undergo retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging obtained 2 weeks after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for kidney stones complicated by _Escherichia coli_ septicemia.

Anterior chamber location of intraocular foreign bodies is rare and usually easily detected on slit-lamp examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this report, we present an unusual case of a large anterior segment non-metallic intraocular foreign body that was missed on initial assessment and remained asymptomatic for 30 years, with no effect on visual function.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 66-year-old retired man was referred as an emergency by his optician for assessment of mild pupil irregularity seen on slit-lamp examination during his routine annual optician review. His past medical history was unremarkable, with no regular medications or known allergies. He is a driver and lives independently with his wife. In the past, he worked as a stonemason and recalled an injury to the left eye while cutting granite using a hammer and a diamond chisel some 30 years ago. At that time, he was assessed in the emergency clinic, reassured that there was no serious ocular injury and discharged from further hospital follow-up with topical antibiotics. He has remained asymptomatic ever since.\n\n【7】At the time of his recent referral, best-corrected visual acuity was recorded as 6/6 in both eyes with no relative afferent pupillary defect and normal colour vision on Ishihara test. The left eye was white and free of inflammation. However, there was a 2.0-mm, round, brown, subconjunctival, cystic lesion located approximately 1.0 mm posterior to the nasal limbus with corresponding mild peaking of the nasal aspect of the pupil . The angle of the anterior chamber was examined using a 3-mirror gonio-lens (Volk Optical®, OH, USA). This revealed a large foreign body embedded in the iris close to the nasal angle . The rest of the left eye examination was normal with clear ocular media and no evidence of optic nerve or retinal dysfunction. The right eye examination was entirely normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Slit-lamp photo of the site of the intraocular foreign body entry wound and the peaked pupil in the left eye.

As the eye was quiet, the optic nerve and retinal functions were normal, and the foreign body was not causing any symptoms or signs, it was decided to avoid any intervention. The patient was advised to keep annual follow-up with his optician, with re-referral advised in the unlikely event of any subsequent symptoms.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Although thankfully rare in the UK, penetrating ocular trauma and intraocular foreign body constitutes an emergency, which often leads to a poor final best-corrected visual acuity in most patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The majority of responsible injuries are work related, presenting in young male adults, especially those employed in the construction industry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】When evaluating patients with a history of ocular trauma, it is imperative to carefully elicit the mechanism of injury. If a high-velocity mechanism is described, such as hammering, grass mowing, chiselling and grinding, especially without adequate protective goggles, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion for a retained intraocular foreign body and this should always be actively ruled out during the examination and investigations.\n\n【16】Scleral penetrating wounds are occasionally difficult to detect on the slit-lamp. Owing to the nature and the structure of the scleral collagen fibres, high-velocity IOFB’s may enter the eye through smaller wounds in the sclera than their actual diameter. Moreover, they are usually masked by conjunctival chemosis and subconjunctival haemorrhage at the time of injury. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival haemorrhage obscuring the sclera is an examination feature, which should raise clinician suspicion of a scleral entry wound following high-velocity trauma injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Orbital radiographs are the most common imaging modality for assessment of suspected IOFBs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be avoided to reduce the risk of inadvertent damage to the intraocular structures by the movement of a metallic IOFB in response to the strong magnets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Considering the history and the mechanism of the injury, we believe the IOFB was a piece of granite, which is a hard, durable and inert material. This explains the lack of inflammatory reaction to the IOFB. The physical constitution of granite is denser than bone, as evidenced on the CT imaging obtained.\n\n【18】The general rule when managing IOFBs is urgent surgical removal to reduce the risk of blinding complications, such as endophthalmitis and siderosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In this case, the IOFB was embedded in the anterior chamber’s angle for many years with no functional damage to the surrounding structures and no impact on vision. Due to this innocuous history and the inert nature of the IOFB in our patient, it was felt that any attempt at surgical removal at this late stage may cause more harm than good and the multi-disciplinary decision was therefore to avoid any intervention.\n\n【19】This report highlights some important principles when evaluating ocular trauma. Firstly, the need to take a careful history is key, specifically elucidating the velocity of injury, in order to gauge the likelihood of ocular penetration. When a high-velocity mechanism is elicited the need for appropriate investigation is paramount—this includes a comprehensive detailed ocular examination. If subconjunctival haemorrhage precludes full examination of the sclera, it is prudent to assume an IOFB and obtain radiological imaging, given the significant consequences and increased risks of a missed foreign body. This report also adds to the body of literature, which highlights the need to impress education surrounding occupational hazards and the need to astutely observe health and safety regulations surrounding personal protective equipment, especially in the construction industries.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No sources of funding involved in the preparation or publication process of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required for this case report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written consent was obtained from the patient to publish the clinical photos and the case report.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTORS\n----------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nadir Ali, Charlotte Buscombe and David Jones.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:25", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:51", "cost": 26.537}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:25"}

T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. It is rare as a primary splenic involvement and is usually reported as a second malignancy after hairy cell leukemia. Here, we report the first case that describes the occurrence of primary splenic T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma in a patient with a previous diagnosis of recurrent hairy cell leukemia. A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia in 1996 and achieved complete remission with Pentostatin. Then, recurrence of hairy cell leukemia was diagnosed in 2015 and treated with Cladribine. In 2016, he presented with B symptoms and hypersplenism. Therapeutic and diagnostic splenectomy was performed. Histopathological study with immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed the presence of T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, second malignancies should be considered in patients with a previous neoplasm when symptoms recur or develop.\n\n【2】BACKGROUND\n----------\n\n【3】Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic, low-grade malignant lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. It is characterized by the accumulation of small, mature B-cells with abundant cytoplasm and hair-like cytoplasmic projections, with or without histiocytes within peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver and splenic red pulp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. The incidence of second malignancies has increased in patients with hairy cell leukemia, either due to the disease itself or secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of the therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a high-grade, morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It constitutes 2–3% of all B-cell lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. The primary occurrence of this subtype in the spleen is scarce. However, up to our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the development of primary splenic THRLBCL in a patient who was previously diagnosed with recurrent HCL.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in 1996 following symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections and easy bruising. Complete remission was achieved with Pentostatin. In 2015, he developed malaise, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow (75%), with focal infiltration by groups of large cells with clear eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei with perinuclear halos contain variable chromatin, and rare mitosis figures without prominent nucleoli were observed. There was a moderate increase in reticulin fibers . A mouse monoclonal IgG1 κ Hairy for the Dako immunohistochemistry was used. Bone marrow immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD20 and hairy cell antibodies \\[Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)\\] on large cells . Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was negative. The histopathological picture and immunohistochemistry findings confirmed the relapse of HCL. We achieved complete remission with Cladribine. The patient continued to do well until June 2016, when he was admitted to our hospital with a history of B-symptoms. Vital signs were within normal range. Clinical examination revealed grade I in-depth and II in-extension lower limbs with edema and a palpable spleen, 12 cm below the costal edge. The patient could not afford the high cost of flow cytometry, so we used antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The bone marrow biopsy sections reveal infiltration by a group of large cells contains clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear halo (arrow head).

In addition, we found no plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, which excludes the blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia. An abdominal ultrasound showed a massive homogenous splenomegaly (26 × 16) cm. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral blood smear exhibited some anisocytosis with a few tear-shaped red cells and a significant decrease in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelet counts. Echocardiography exposed preserved Ejection Fraction (EF) and mild regurgitation in the mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves with no significant gradient. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray (CXR) were within normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed homogenous splenomegaly (26.3× 16) cm, without other abnormalities. We transferred the patient to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic splenectomy due to suspicion of hypersplenism and without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【9】Gross examination showed massive splenomegaly . The spleen was cut into two segments measuring (24× 9× 8) cm and (22× 9× 8.5) cm . Microscopic examination using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) revealed splenic tissue infiltrated by monoclonal, large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei . Immunohistochemistry evaluation results were positive for CD20 on large cells , CD3 on some of the background small lymphocytes , CD15  and CD45. However, it was negative for CD30 and hairy cell staining. To exclude the possibility of blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia, we performed additional staining for Annexin A1 , TRAP  and CD103  in a private histology laboratory, which all became negative. Staining for CD22 and CD25 was not available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103. These results confirmed the diagnosis of T-cell rich B cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematology-oncology department to receive chemotherapy. The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP. The patient had an uneventful follow-up until Feb 2021, when we lost the follow-up with him for unknown reasons.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|A) gross examination reveals a huge splenomegaly.

HCL typically occurs in middle-aged men presenting with pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Morphologically, it is characterized by typical hairy cells with irregular, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cytoplasmic projections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–10 \\]</u>. HCL, hairy cell leukemia—variant (HCL-v) and splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma may have cytoplasmic projections. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate HCL from other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. HCL expresses TRAP and stains positive for annexin A1, cyclin D1, CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123. HCL also negatively stains CD5, CD23 and CD10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Although HCL-v could be TRAP-positive, CD25, cyclin D1 and annexin A1 are characteristically absent. Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (previously diagnosed as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes) lacks annexin A1, CD5, CD25, CD103 and CD11c 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. To exclude the blastic transformation of HCL in our case, we performed staining Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103, which all became negative. However, staining for CD22 and CD25 was not\n\n【18】available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103.\n\n【19】T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell Lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a new clinicopathological entity. It was first described in 1988. It constitutes almost 0.1% of all lymphomas. It is rare to encounter THRLBCL as a primary lymphoma in the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The WHO classification of lymphomas included THRLBCL as a specific histologic subtype of DLBCL; and reserved its diagnosis for cases in which the large B-cell component accounts for 10% or less of tumor cells, surrounded by a majority population of small polyclonal T cells, with or without histiocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The available knowledge about THRLBCL is scarce and mainly derived from published cases and case series. This subtype often has aggressive clinical behavior. Therefore, patients often present in advanced stages with splenomegaly and bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemical staining for B-cells is always positive for CD20 and CD45, whereas there is a rarity of the positivity of CD30. More than 50% of cases are positive for BCL-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The occurrence of a second malignancy with HCL synchronously or subsequently has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The most extensive study on this topic reported second cancer among 3104 patients with HCL and concluded that patients with HCL are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia and thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Many theories were suggested to explain this phenomenon, the shared genetic predisposition, environmental exposure to carcinogens and immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Pentostatin or cladribine remains the standard first-line treatment of HCL and could achieve cure rates of 70–90%. However, a complete cure with purine analog therapy is uncertain as patients are still at risk for relapse after an average of 15–16 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. On the other hand, Rituximab therapy showed cure rates of 10–54%, while a combination of purine analog and Rituximab could achieve cure rates of 88–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 14 \\]</u>. However, the latter is associated with increased immunosuppression, toxicities and second malignancies from purine analogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 13 \\]</u>. Moreover, the splenectomy could worsen immunity and allow for mutations and subsequent transformation of HCL into a more severe neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The patient, in this case, has undergone diagnostic/therapeutic splenectomy due to splenic recurrence of HCL. Splenectomy is a well-described part of HCL treatment that helps to enhance hematologic parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Surprisingly, the biopsy revealed the presence of THRLBCL as the malignancy in the spleen. Moreover, the flow cytometry came TRAP negative and HCL staining negative. However, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether the presence of TRCBCL was a coincidence or whether there is a causal relationship between the two malignancies. In our case, we rely on the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103 to exclude the blastic transformation of HCL.\n\n【22】In conclusion, hairy cell leukemia is an indolent, chronic lymphoproliferative malignancy. It is common to develop a second malignancy in this leukemia, attributed to several theories. However, THRLBCL is rare as primary splenic involvement and a second malignancy after HCL. Second malignancies should be considered, whether symptoms relapsed or new ones developed in patients who previously had neoplasm, especially HCL. However, we recommend close monitoring for early detection of possible new malignancies in HCL patients.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pathology department for helping with sample analysis.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by Damascus University.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written informed consent for publication of his clinical details and images.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HA and TA are the guarantor of this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:35:14", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:35:29", "cost": 14.617}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:35:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:35:14"}

The patient, who requested publication of this case, is a highly intelligent and distinguished robotic scientist. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2017 and his personal approach to his condition has been to use modern technology and all treatment options to maximise his quality and duration of life. After his research, the patient decided that his life would be significantly improved by formation of an elective ‘triple-ostomy’, this being an end colostomy and suprapubic catheter (for continence), and a percutaneous gastrostomy (for nutrition). We report the peri-operative multidisciplinary approach taken with this case, the surgical procedures, the potential risks and the outcome. The patient is delighted with the result and aims to raise awareness that this may be a treatment option in highly selected patients.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Motor neurone disease (MND) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder, which most frequently affects individuals in their 60s and 70s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1\\]</u> . It is progressive in nature and always fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1\\]</u> . Current treatment options are limited.\n\n【4】At the direct request of a fully informed patient, a combined surgical procedure was performed to improve current and future quality of life. We are not aware of another such procedure being reported previously. In this case, it was successful and the patient wishes to raise awareness of this treatment option.\n\n【5】It is important to balance the potential risks of this treatment against the potential benefit and emphasise the multidisciplinary team approach required.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】At the age of 58, the patient received a formal diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He had previously been fit and well. His own personal approach to his condition is to use all aspects of modern technology and all treatment options in order to prolong and maximise the quality of his life. Medically, this has included the planning for permanent home invasive ventilation and nutrition. Technologically, this has involved the training of systems to aid with communication and mobilisation. Understanding the progression of his disease, the patient independently decided that he would be best served by the formation of a gastrostomy, colostomy and suprapubic catheter (‘triple-ostomy’). This would allow long term nutrition and more dignified management of toileting. He was aware that this would involve significant risks, particularly due to the anaesthesia required with his deteriorating respiratory function, and therefore requested that these procedures be performed in a single operation and relatively rapidly before his respiratory function deteriorated further.\n\n【8】It became apparent that no patient in the region had ever requested such a procedure. It seemed reasonable, in a fully informed patient who understood the potential risks, to proceed to put a team in place to carry out the treatment. A truly multidisciplinary peri-operative approach was necessary. Peri-operative medicine describes the practise of ‘patient-centred, multidisciplinary and integrated medical care of patients from the moment of contemplation of surgery until full recovery’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2\\]</u> . Prior to surgery, the patient met the three different surgical consultants that would be required for the surgery to discuss risks and benefits and perform informed consent. He and his carers pre-operatively spent time with the stoma team and the ward nursing team in order to plan the care.\n\n【9】A formal anaesthetic pre-operative assessment was undertaken, including spirometry to assess lung function followed by a consultant review to discuss risks and specific plans for post-operative care. The potential for worsening of MND symptoms and the requirement for post-operative invasive ventilation were discussed including the possibility of a tracheostomy and an extended hospital stay. A step down to non-invasive ventilation on the intensive care unit (ICU) was panned and a preoperative discussion with the home ventilation team was engaged.\n\n【10】The combined surgery was performed electively on the 10 July 2018. A general anaesthetic with target controlled propofol and remifentanil was undertaken. Intubation was undertaken with high doses of remifentanil. Muscle relaxants were avoided as their use in MND patients has been proposed to increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, rhabdomyolysis and potential for prolonged neuromuscular blockage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3\\]</u> . Post-operative analgesia was in the form of an oxycodone patient-controlled analgesic pump and a subcutaneous ketamine infusion to minimise the risks of opiate induced respiratory depression.\n\n【11】The three surgical procedures were performed in a standard manner; each being well-established procedures in normal practise. Initially, the suprapubic catheter was placed. Secondly, the colorectal team established a pneumoperitoneum and the sigmoid colon and rectum were then mobilised laparoscopically as per routine practise. The bowel was delivered via a trephine left iliac fossa incision marked pre-operatively by the stoma team and an end colostomy was fashioned. Thirdly, the upper gastrointestinal surgeon then placed the gastrostomy tube. This was performed under direct laparoscopic vision and the stomach was fixed to the abdominal wall by intra-corporeal sutures. The order of procedures was planned as the catheter placement was extra-peritoneal and would fix the bladder out of the pelvis, aiding the laparoscopic pelvic dissection and hence performed first. The gastrostomy was last to avoid any theoretical tension that may have been placed on the gastrostomy by a prolonged pneumoperitoneum. The total operative time was 3 hours and 40 minutes.\n\n【12】Post-operatively, the patient was taken to ICU ventilated to ensure optimisation prior to extubation and allow extubation straight onto bilevel non-invasive ventilation via a facemask. This was rapidly weaned to self-ventilation. This stepwise approach in the setting of ICU ensured optimal return of respiratory function before extubation. The patient spent 1 day in ICU before discharge to a general surgical ward with ICU outreach service support. The patient was discharged on day 15 post-op.\n\n【13】The patient is thrilled with the result of his operation, from his perspective, it has significantly improved his current and future quality of life. At 12 week surgical follow up, there were no issues and he was discharged to the community team. He genuinely sees the triple-ostomy as something which has transformed his life and has absolutely no regrets. Even when ‘massive disability survival _’_ is the primary outcome, there may be patients for whom this is an acceptable outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4\\]</u> .\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】To our knowledge, this is the first time these procedures have been performed in a single operation for the pre-emptive management of MND.

They are discovered incidentally in most cases. Data on their incidence, diagnosis, prognosis and management remain insufficient. The discovery is usually made at an advanced stage of lung cancer with the presence of metastases to other organs. We reported the case of a patient undergoing oncology follow-up for lung adenocarcinoma with discovery of adrenal gland metastases and a solitary pancreatic metastatic mass. His management remains palliative chemotherapy. Surgical treatment is not yet codified in these cases and remains at the discretion of the multidisciplinary oncology teams.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lung cancers are diagnosed at a metastatic stage in 40–50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Common metastases sites of lung cancers remain liver, adrenal, bone and kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Pancreatic metastases of lung cancers are rare and incidental. It is usually seen at an advanced stage of the disease with other associated metastases. Data on its incidence, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment remain poor. Its incidence is 12% in post-mortem patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its prognosis remains guarded given the often advanced stage of the pathology. Several methods of treatment as surgery management, chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy were proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】These metastases may raise a diagnosis issue between a primary pancreatic or secondary lung cancer localization. In most cases, this diagnosis is made at a stage of multiple metastases in patients known to have primary lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the literature, most of the data have been provided by post-mortem examination of patients with primary lung cancer. However, studies are still needed to improve our knowledge of these pancreatic metastases and to improve the coding of their management. Imaging examinations, in particular the computed tomography (CT) scan, play an essential role in the discovery of these pancreatic metastases. It remains the routine imaging examination for monitoring patients in oncology.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We reported a case of 69-year-old male who was diagnosed since a year for lung adenocarcinoma. His treatment based on chemotherapy according to the line treatment of medical oncology of the hospital. He was in good health without any symptomatology. During his follow-up, thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan revealed a roughly rounded, poorly defined lung mass with irregular in shape, enhanced at the periphery after contrast media injection .\n\n【7】Two bilateral adrenal masses were also discovered as hypodense, poorly defined, irregularly, and enhanced after injection of contrast medium .\n\n【8】A hypodense pancreatic corporal mass, roughly rounded, with irregular contours, enhanced after injection of contrast medium, without dilation of the Wirsung. There is associated dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and the main bile duct . On ultrasound, this mass corresponds to a rounded, heterogeneous, echogenic lesion with discrete peripheral vascularization on color Doppler . A endoscopic biopsy for pancreatic mass was performed to confirm the diagnostic of non-primary tumor of pancreas. Histology confirmed a metastatic mass of lung cancer.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest CT scan injected (portal phase) in axial section in a parenchymal ( **A** ) and mediastinal ( **B** ) window showing a pulmonary mass with a necrotic center highlighted in the periphery in upper right lobe (red star).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Abdominal CT scan injected (delayed phase: 10 min) in axial section ( **A** and **B** ) showing bilateral adrenal masses .

There were no surgical indications according to the multidisciplinary consultation. The patient changed the treatment line due to multiple metastases, essentially involving chemotherapy without any radiotherapy.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The most frequent metastases of lung cancer are liver, brain, adrenal and bone. Pancreatic metastases remain rare. There is not enough data on this issue. These pancreatic metastases of lung cancers would represent <5% in patients living with a pancreatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. According to Adsay _et al._ , in autopsies performed on 4955 patients with metastases, the rate of pancreatic metastases was 1.6% and the primary sites in order of increase were renal cell carcinoma followed by lung cancer and colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In Japan, Maeno _et al._ found 26 cases of pulmonary metastases (3%) in 850 patients with lung cancer. In order of frequency, pancreatic metastases involved the following histological types: small cell carcinoma 10.5% and only 2.3% of adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of these metastases remains difficult clinically, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery for other cancers, and is in most cases discovered on imaging, most often on CT scan. The other major difficulty is the distinction between primary and secondary pancreatic tumors. For Klein _et al._ , the CT features that may point to a pancreatic metastasis are the presence of other organ metastases, then often well-limited and more hypodense compared with a primary tumor and the intense enhancement indicative of the hypervascular nature of the metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This distinction is even more difficult in solitary pancreatic masses. In their series, Maeno found that the usual pattern of pancreatic metastasis involved a solitary nodule in 73%, multiple nodules in 11.5% and diffuse swelling in 15.4% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most metastatic lesions are located in the head of the pancreas, leading to obstruction of the bile ducts and jaundice. For some authors in the case of lung cancers, the majority are located in the head or the body of the pancreas with ~76% locating in the head in small cell lung carcinomas, followed by the body in 15% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Generally, three aspects have been described most commonly a solitary pancreatic mass between 50 and 80%. The second aspect is that of diffuse infiltration of the pancreas through the glandular septa between 15 and 44% and the third aspect is that of multiple pancreatic nodules resulting in extensive destruction of the lobules of the pancreatic parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】From a therapeutic point of view, there is no real consensus on the management of these pancreatic metastases. Indeed, the discovery of pancreatic metastasis is made at an advanced stage of primary cancer, lung cancer. Very few cases of surgery are performed. It would be better indicated in cases where the primary lung tumor is well controlled and with a solitary pancreatic mass. In a Japanese study of patients with pancreatic metastases of lung cancer, only eight cases of resection of pancreatic metastases were recorded from 1998 to 2006. All of these cases were with metastases from other organs (liver, adrenals and brain) after satisfactory control of these metastases by chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Adler _et al._ found a low rate of pancreatectomy for pancreatic metastasis of lung cancer with only eight cases of surgery out of 399 patients; this is due to the poor prognosis but also the late discovery of these metastases from lung cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The surgical management of metastases would be an excellent therapeutic, that means to improve the survival of patients outside adjuvant treatments, but no data on this management are yet known in this indication, and therefore needs further study. Roland _et al._ found a survival time after the discovery of pancreatic metastases from lung cancer of ~8.7 months (1–28 months) and only 4 of the 27 patients had received surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, therefore, have an essential role in the management of these patients with metastases, particularly because of the late stage of the disease with the presence of metastases to other organs.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEGEMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the following individuals for their review of earlier drafts of the manuscript: Prof. Latib Rachida and Prof. Omor Youssef, Radiology Department of National Institute of Oncology, Ibn Sina hospital, Rabat, Morocco.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication was obtained from patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Yehouenou Tessi Romeo Thierry is acting as a guarantor of this manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:05:39", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:05:56", "cost": 16.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:05:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:05:39"}

He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection about 3 weeks prior to this (mid-June 2020) presentation. He had returned to work following 2 weeks of isolation, but had difficulty coping due to exertional dyspnoea. Pulse oximetry demonstrated oxygen desaturation to 85%, particularly whilst wearing an N95 mask. His blood pressure (122/76 mmHg) and heart rate (76 beats/min) remained normal. There were no clinically relevant findings other than a body mass index of 25.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . He had poor effort tolerance on a 6-min walk test, managing a distance of only 120 m.\n\n【6】The following differential diagnoses were considered: pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and myocarditis. Chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal . Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 4.80x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l (normal 3.92–10.4) with a normal differential count, C-reactive protein 5 mg/l (normal < 10 mg/l), ferritin 267 μg/l (normal 30–400 ug/l), D-dimer < 0.10 mg/l (0.0–0.25 mg/l) and NT-proBNP of 143 ng/l (normal < 300 ng/l). However, his high sensitivity Troponin T level was elevated at 319 ng/l (normal < 14 ng/l) and showed a steady rise to 490 ng/l. His transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) contractility and no regional wall motion abnormality or myocardial hypertrophy. There was no pericardial effusion. The pulmonary arteries were of normal size. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was normal . The coronary arteries were normal. Based on the clinical findings, rising troponin-T levels, and new T wave inversion in lead III on a repeat 12-lead ECG, a diagnosis of likely COVID-19-related viral myocarditis was made. Treatment with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily and prednisone 40 mg once daily were initiated whilst awaiting a CMR scan.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Normal baseline 12-lead ECG (top) and T wave inversion in lead III on follow-up visit (bottom).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Antero-posterior view of chest radiograph (left) showing normal lung fields and CT of the chest (right) confirming absence of parenchyma lung involvement.</u>\n\n【9】The CMR scan confirmed normal LV and RV function and wall thickness with an LV ejection fraction of 65%, RV ejection fraction of 56% and wall thickness at end-diastole of 7 mm.

The exact pathophysiology still needs to be elucidated. Currently, it is postulated that it may be the result of a cytokine storm, notably Interleukin-6, or direct invasion of the myocardium by the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 likely enters the myocardium by attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cell surface. Pathology findings in the myocardium have been variable and non-specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 can present in the absence of pneumonia, as in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. From the published reports, the clinical presentation is varied, ranging from mild symptoms such as chest pain, fatiguability and palpitations to severe disease such as ventricular dysrhythmias, sudden cardiac death and pump failure. An elevated troponin level is suggestive of myocardial involvement and implies severe SARS-CoV-2 disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, a rise in troponin levels may be due to multiple factors in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The differentials include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or may merely reflect demand–supply mismatch in a critically ill patient. In these patients, additional imaging is useful to exclude myocarditis as a cause of elevated troponin levels. TTE is a useful first-line bedside investigation to assess regional or global LV dysfunction, pericardial effusion, LV hypertrophy and to exclude other causes of a troponin leak. However, CMR imaging has a higher sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. It is particularly useful in cases where echocardiography is normal and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) cannot be easily performed. Myocarditis typically involves the infero-postero-lateral wall at the base of the LV, but can be diffuse in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Myocardial oedema and LGE are characteristic features of myocarditis on CMR imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> as noted in the current case report. In recent reports of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis clinicians have not consistently made use CMR imaging or EMB for diagnosis of myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The underutilization of CMR imaging and EMB makes it challenging to differentiate primary myocarditis from secondary myocardial injury.\n\n【21】In general, the advocated management of viral myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 entails use of immunosuppression, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and cytokine blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u> but recommendations have varied. In addition to heart failure therapy and supportive management, steroids with or without IL-6 inhibitors, and antiviral monotherapy without immunosuppression have all been used. Our patient had localized myocarditis with mild to moderate symptoms in the absence of heart failure or respiratory involvement and was treated with a combination of prednisone and colchicine due to its inhibition of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】This case highlights and reinforces the diagnostic utility of CMR and biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval was obtained from University of the Witwatersrand ethics committee (M200991).</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Ruchika Meel.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:30:19", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:31:23", "cost": 64.695}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:31:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:30:19"}

His only comorbidity was chronic abdominal pain related to his diagnosis. He was managing his pain with the use of illicit opioids calculated between 350 and 500 mg oral morphine equivalents daily, taken as a combination of hydromorphone, hydromorph contin and oxycodone. He had been consuming opioids for ~4 months prior to presenting for APR. He was brought to the operating room and a pre-induction thoracic epidural was placed at the level of T8. Induction of anesthesia was uneventful, and maintenance was achieved with a volatile anesthetic, ketamine infusion of 0.3 mg/kg/hour IV and thoracic epidural infusion of bupivacaine 0.125%, hydromorphone 10 mcg/ml and epinephrine 1: 200 k infusing at 14 mls/hour. Approximately 2 hours into the case the surgeon converted to an open technique with a mid-line laparotomy incision. Hydromorphone boluses of 0.5 mg were given at the anesthesiologist discretion for a total dose of 4.5 mg over 5.5 hours. Surgical resection was successful and emergence was uneventful.\n\n【7】The patient was seen twice daily by the Acute Pain Service (APS) who managed his postoperative analgesia. His epidural was continued at 16 mls/hour and an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was initiated for breakthrough pain. The PCA solution was a combination of hydromorphone 0.5 mg/ml plus ketamine 0.2 mg/ml with the following settings: bolus of 0.5 mg hydromorphone with a 6-minute lockout to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/hour hydromorphone (2.0 mg of ketamine). His surgeon requested strict nil per os (NPO) and nothing per rectum, limiting the adjuncts available for pain control.\n\n【8】The morning of postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient reported his pain as 9/10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS). The pain was described as a deep abdominal burning sensation. His level of sensory blockade was T6 to L1 bilaterally. He had received a total of 10.5 mg of hydromorphone and 4.2 mg of ketamine PCA solution with 18 denied attempts overnight. In an attempt to further optimize his pain control, the epidural was bolused 5 mls and the basal rate was increased to 20 mls/hour. Post epidural bolus, his NRS was 8 and he felt some relief. Reassessment of his epidural block level noted no change in coverage. At this time, a basal rate was added to his PCA of 0.5 mg/hour hydromorphone and 0.2 mg/hour of ketamine, and the remainder of his PCA settings were left unchanged.\n\n【9】On the morning of POD 2, the patient again rated his NRS at 9. His PCA usage including denied attempts from overnight can be seen in Fig. 1 . His epidural was changed at this time to a more concentrated solution of bupivacaine 0.2%, hydromorphone 10 mcg/ml and epinephrine 1: 200 k. A 5-ml epidural bolus was given and the basal rate of 20 mls/hour was maintained. That afternoon, his NRS was rated 7 with little change in his PCA usage. At this time, a 5 mg bolus of preservative-free morphine was given epidurally.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|PCA use POD 1–7. Dark blue—delivered attempts. Light blue—denied attempts.</u>\n\n【11】The morning of POD 3, the patient rated his NRS at 8 noting only small reduction in pain overnight. Concerningly, the patient was refusing to ambulate because of discomfort. At this time, the APS decided to add dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/ml to the epidural solution. A 5-ml epidural bolus was given and a basal rate of 20 mls/hour was continued. That afternoon, the patient rated his NRS at 7, with a noticed reduction in the number of denied attempts in his PCA .\n\n【12】Between POD 4 and POD 7, a noticeable decline in the patient’s PCA use can be seen . Further, a downward trend in his NRS score is also noted during this interval . Over this time, his epidural was titrated down while maintaining an NRS of 5 or less and was eventually discontinued on POD 7. His PCA basal rate was discontinued on POD 5 and PCA discontinued on POD 7 entirely. Additionally, the patient was able to begin ambulation and physiotherapy on POD5. The patient was successfully transitioned to an oral analgesic regimen before being discharged from hospital.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|NRS pain score from POD 1 to 7.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Dexmedetomidine has been established as an effective co-analgesic agent via multiple routes of delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Postoperative dexmedetomidine epidural infusions have been shown in thoracotomy patients to be associated with lower pain scores and significantly reduced PCA use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This same finding has been demonstrated in patient’s undergoing laparotomy for abdominal cancer surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and colonic resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Further, in these studies, it was also shown that patients receiving epidural dexmedetomidine had significantly increased time to first postoperative analgesic request 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and significantly reduced time to first flatus and bowel movement following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】We present the postoperative epidural use of dexmedetomidine in a patient with rectal cancer and opioid dependence, a population group where dexmedetomidine has not been specifically studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Patients with a history of significant opioid use are often excluded from studies adding to the challenge of research informed perioperative pain management in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is known that inadequate postoperative pain control is associated with adverse events including myocardial ischemia, impaired respiratory function and thromboembolic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Escalating doses of opioids in these patients has been associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and a multimodal approach to pain management is recommended to reduce opioid escalation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In our case, we considered it reasonable to trial the addition of dexmedetomidine to the patient’s epidural solution as his pain was seemingly refractory to his mainly opioid-based regimen. Furthermore, opioid-induced hyperalgesia was felt to be a significant contributor to the etiology of the patient’s refractory pain, and thus, additional opioid analgesia would unlikely be effective while increasing the risk of adverse effects. The relatively rapid response of the patient’s pain to the epidural dexmedetomidine is consistent with what has been previously reported in the literature. Adverse effects associated with the use of dexmedetomidine include reduced cardiac output, hypotension, sedation and reduced respiratory rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. None of these effects were noted in any significance in our patient by bedside nursing according to APS monitoring protocols.\n\n【18】In summary, we report a case whereby the use of epidural dexmedetomidine in an opioid-dependent patient produced rapid control of the patient’s refractory postoperative pain from an APR. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to elucidate the role of neuraxial dexmedetomidine in postoperative analgesia for opioid-dependent patients.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Terry Robertshaw, NP and Savanah Prete, NP for their exceptional patient care.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We report no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We did not receive funding for this report.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent was obtained before writing this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mathew P.

We describe a case of a 74-year-old male who developed an aortic-cavitary fistulous tract as a complication of prosthetic aortic valve infective endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed an aorto-cavitary fistula (ACF) connecting the aortic root with the left ventricle, creating an intracardiac shunt, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation physiology. The patient underwent surgery with successful exclusion of the ACF. ACF is an unusual complication of infective endocarditis that creates an abnormal communication between the aortic root and the heart chambers, establishing an intracardiac shunt. This case highlights that physicians should be aware of the possibility of rare cardiac complications in infective endocarditis. TEE is a valid diagnostic test for ACF.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infectious process of the endocardial surface of the heart, most commonly involving the valvular apparatus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The annual incidence of IE is three to nine cases per 100 000 in developed countries like the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patients with prosthetic valves, cardiac devices, unrepaired cyanotic heart disease, intravenous drug use, prolonged bacteremia and history of endocarditis are at the highest risk of developing endocarditis.\n\n【4】The vast majority of IE is caused by _Staphylococci_ or _Streptococci_ . Well-known cardiac complications due to endocarditis include perivalvular abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, dehiscence of prosthetic valves, conduction abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, cerebrovascular accidents and central nervous system infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】This case report describes a rare complication whereby IE originated an aorto-cavitary fistula (ACF), which is formed when an abscess or pseudoaneurysm involving the sinus of Valsalva ruptures, resulting in the formation of a communication between the aortic root and the cardiac chambers, endangering adequate hemodynamics by the formation of an intracardiac shunt.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Brain MRI.

His past medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation on long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of 30% and aortic stenosis with two previous bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve replacements in 2004 and 2014. Two months prior to admission, he was diagnosed with IE caused by Group B _Streptococcus_ involving the aortic bioprosthetic valve. Initially, he presented with complaints of intermittent febrile episodes and night diaphoresis for approximately 8 weeks. At that time, the decision was made to treat him conservatively with oral antibiotics and close clinical monitoring. Blood cultures were negative in two different occasions, and the patient was discharged on stable conditions. However, a day prior to his second hospital admission, the patient noted sudden onset right upper extremity weakness (MRC power grade 3) and dysarthria. Upon further evaluation in the ED, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple embolic strokes .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed a perivalvular cavity around the aortic root, and this cavity was communicating with the aorta. Furthermore, the cavity was also in communication with the left ventricle (LV), creating a dynamic of retrograde flow, with blood passing from the aorta to the LV through the fistulous tract . As a result, the patient developed an ACF due to perivalvular endocarditis, which resulted in symptomatic severe aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【11】The patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further surgical evaluation. His physical examination was unremarkable, except for a slight right facial droop and mild dysarthria. All initial laboratory including new sets of blood cultures were unremarkable. He continued empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone. Sacubitril/valsartan and metoprolol were discontinued due to concerns of rapid progression to complete heart block in the setting of a perivalvular cavity.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

The consensus was that patient’s presentation was likely caused by a perivalvular abscess/pseudoaneurysm, which was further complicated by the formation of an ACF, requiring rapid surgical intervention. Coronary angiogram was performed as part of the preoperative evaluation, revealing smooth eccentric narrowing (50–60%) of the ostial/proximal left circumflex (LCx), which raised the suspicion of possible external compression from the known aortic root pseudoaneurysm/perivalvular abscess seen on CTA .\n\n【15】TEE in the operating room evidenced a large posterior aortic pseudoaneurysm underneath the left coronary artery, corresponding to the narrowing of the LCx. This was then confirmed by surgical exploration and visual inspection. Active infection with pus secretion was noticed around the aortic annulus, with small vegetations on the prosthesis. The surgical procedure consisted of a third cardiac redo surgery with full sternotomy, explantation of previous prosthetic aortic valve and exclusion of the ACF. The aortic root and valve were replaced with a 24 mm homograft, and the LCx was reimplanted.\n\n【16】The patient recovered without significant complications, and he went home with intravenous ceftriaxone through a peripherally inserted central catheter for a total of 6 weeks, and any further oral antibiotic therapy was not required. Close outpatient monitoring with follow-up with cardiology, neurology, infectious disease and primary care provider was arranged in the next week. All neurological manifestations were entirely resolved with treatment and rehabilitation.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】A well-documented complication of IE is the development of periannular abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, cases describing the progression of an abscess into a pseudoaneurysm that ruptures internally, while connecting the aortic root with the heart chambers, and resulting in a subsequent ACF are reported far less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. ACF is caused by the extension and infiltration of the pyogenic and necrotic tissue from the perivalvular abscess into the cardiac chambers. This results in the expansion and rupture of the weakened necrotic myocardium, creating intracardiac fistulous communication. It is possible to develop an intracardiac communication leading to blood flow dynamics similar to those seen in valvulopathies.\n\n【19】Prior to Anguera _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, the data was limited exclusively to case reports. According to this study, the prevalence of ACF is as high as 5.8% in individuals in whom endocarditis infects a prosthetic valve. TEE and cardiac MRI are valid imaging modalities for the detection of ACF in native and prosthetic valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Physicians should consider discontinuation of medications with negative chronotropic properties such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, as ACF has been associated with the development conduction abnormalities like complete heart block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The mechanism of atrioventricular conduction disorder in ACF is the result of inflammation from the bacterial colonization of the valve and surrounding tissues, and the electric conduction system of the heart is no exception. ACFs usually originate from the sinus of Valsalva, increasing the risk of invasive coronary angiography. Other imaging modalities to evaluate the coronary arteries such as coronary CTA may be considered in similar circumstances.\n\n【21】Surgery to repair the fistula is advised. Practitioners should have a high suspicion for cardiac pathology in patients presenting with IE and should not hesitate to consider urgent surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, patients who are severely hemodynamically unstable or those who have multiple comorbidities are not candidates to undergo surgery. Percutaneous procedure is another option in high-risk patients when active infection is healed with antibiotics.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report does not require ethical approval.

We report on a 67-year-old female patient, who was severely affected by post-herpetic NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. Her symptoms did not improve under methylprednisolone pulse therapy and plasma exchange under acyclovir prophylaxis. She received protein A immunoadsorption and a long-term immunosuppression with rituximab. Under treatment, activated T-cells as well as B- and plasma cells decreased in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and anti-NMDA-R IgG titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid declined with near complete cessation of intrathecal autoantibody synthesis. The patient regained near complete independence and profoundly improved on formal neuropsychological assessment. Despite reduction of antiviral defense through of lowered activated T cells and concomitantly decreasing HSV-specific IgG antibodies, no evidence of viral reactivation was detected.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In certain cases, relapsing symptoms following Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) encephalitis are caused by the formation of autoantibodies directed against the GluN1 subunit of the human NMDA-receptor (NMDA-R), linking autoimmune and infective pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.

Patients with post-herpetic NMDA-autoimmune encephalitis often suffer from residual deficits due to the HSV1 infection and experience new or worsening symptoms through NMDA-R–autoantibody formation.

We describe an adult female patient suffering from severe relapsing post-herpetic anti-NMDA-R encephalitis, which failed to respond to MP and PLEX but improved remarkably under IA followed by induction of rituximab treatment at relapse. Both methods of therapeutic apheresis (PLEX and IA) have emerged as possible treatment options for autoimmune encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.

During maintenance treatment, activated T-cells as well as B- and plasma cells decreased in PB and CSF. Anti-NMDA-R IgG titers in PB and CSF declined with near complete cessation of intrathecal autoantibody synthesis. Despite reduction of activated T cells in PB and CSF and concomitant decreasing HSV IgG ASI, no evidence of viral reactivation was detected under treatment with rituximab. Cognitive and motor abilities increased, as demonstrated by NPA and improvement on modified Rankin scale, which declined from 5 to 2 within 12 months. Hence, rituximab in combination with IA, presents a possible treatment option for refractory post-herpetic NMDA-encephalitis as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Pleural effusion in myeloma is rare and may result from myelomatous infiltration of the pleura or heart failure in cardiac amyloidosis. Benign causes of pleural effusion include infection, hypoalbuminemia or chronic renal impairment. Myelomatous pleural effusion (MPE) is diagnosed via pleural fluid cytomorphology and flow cytometry for malignant PCs, protein electrophoresis or pleural biopsy. A 74-year-old man with immunoglobulin A myeloma developed recurrent MPE with possible secondary cardiac amyloidosis. Despite achieving partial remission in serum paraprotein, the effusion was refractory to percutaneous drainage and pleurodesis. The treatment is aimed at eradicating myeloma and relieving respiratory symptoms. Early recognition of myeloma progression into extramedullary infiltration and secondary amyloidosis is important. While chemotherapy intensification in older patients can be challenging, multidisciplinary management is essential in alleviating symptoms and in improving the quality of life.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pleural effusion during the course of treatment for myeloma may be caused by infection, hypoalbuminemia or chronic renal impairment. Rarely, myeloma may progress into extramedullary infiltration of the pleura or secondary amyloidosis which carries poor prognosis. Treatment with chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients, may cause further morbidity, and the overall condition should be managed within a multidisciplinary setting.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A previously fit 74-year-old male presented with lethargy and reduced effort tolerance for 1 month. He had normochromic normocytic anemia (8.3 g/dl), raised creatinine (143 μmol/l), hypercalcemia (3.34 mmol/l), hypoalbuminemia (27 g/l) and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. He was diagnosed with R-ISS Stage II multiple myeloma (MM) following the detection of serum monoclonal paraproteinaemia immunoglobulin A (IgA) Kappa (37 g/l) and Bence Jones protein 789 mg/l. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy demonstrated 47% plasma cells (PCs) infiltration with positivity toward CD138 and Kappa light chain restriction. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotype, however, fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization detected deletion 13q and an extra copy of TP53 gene in 55% of the cells analyzed. The beta-2 microglobulin was raised by 7.2 mg/l. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan demonstrated no bone lesions, however, there was right-sided pleural effusion  possibly due to inadvertent fluid overload secondary to hyperhydration for hypercalcemia, which resolved with frusemide on subsequent chest X-ray . A baseline echocardiogram was normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|PET-CT scan demonstrated right-sided pleural effusion due to inadvertent fluid overload secondary to hyperhydration for hypercalcemia.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|( **A** , **B** ) Chest x-ray with clear bilateral lung fields after treatment with frusemide (A); presence of bilateral mild pleural effusion upon completion of first chemotherapy cycle with concurrent development of AF and dyspnea (B).</u>\n\n【8】After completion of the first chemotherapy cycle, which consisted of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, he developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and dyspnea. Chest X-ray showed mild bilateral pleural effusion . Echocardiogram detected concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with 15-mm thickness and dilated left atrium . The ejection fraction was preserved at 59%. Tissue doppler imaging of the septal wall showed reduced septal velocity of 4 cm/s and elevated E/e’ value of 19.49, with apical sparing pattern and reduced global longitudinal strain value of −16.8% . Myeloma-associated cardiac amyloidosis was suspected. The serum pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was elevated at >9000 pg/ml, however, a troponin level was not available. BM trephine and transcutaneous fat pad biopsies were negative for Congo red stain. CT scan revealed no hepatomegaly or pulmonary alveolar infiltrate.

The effusion was transudative and the cultures were negative for microorganism growth. Pleural fluid immunophenotyping was performed using FACS Lyric flow cytometer system (Becton-Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium) which showed gated cells positivity for CD45 (dim), CD19, CD138 (bright) and aberrant expression of CD56, consistent with myelomatous pleural effusion (MPE).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Pleural fluid cytology with numerous PCs (red arrow) and mesothelial cells (yellow arrowhead; MGG stain 40×).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Flow cytometry plot showing immunophenotyping of pleural fluid.

He achieved partial remission after two cycles of chemotherapy with paraprotein reduction to 6.6 g/l. Unfortunately, the malignant effusion recurred a month later. Bilateral seldinger tubes (12Fr) were inserted with cumulative pleural fluid drainage of 5200 ml on the right and 4250 ml on the left, followed by left talc pleurodesis, and the left chest drain was successfully removed. However, he continued to have persistent drainage on the right, and an indwelling pleural catheter was considered. Lenalidomide was introduced as a part of VRD chemotherapy to salvage the disease. The option of radiotherapy was discussed, however, the patient continued to deteriorate with sepsis and succumbed a few weeks later.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Pleural effusion occurred in 6% of MM patients predominantly due to amyloidosis-related congestive heart failure, while other causes include MPE, infection, hypoalbuminemia and chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. MPE is a rare extramedullary manifestation associated with poor prognosis. The incidence of MPE was 2.65% with a median survival of 2.47 months and occurred at median age of 50 years with a male predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. MPE was the presenting feature in 45.45% of patients, predominantly unilateral in 81.8% patients, and the majority of the disease subtype was IgG Kappa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We report a patient with IgA MM who developed MPE with possible secondary cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【17】The diagnosis of MPE requires demonstration of neoplastic PC on pleural fluid cytology, immunophenotyping, pleural fluid electrophoresis or pleural biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Differentiating neoplastic from reactive PC can be morphologically challenging, especially in the presence of cellular degeneration or inadequate sample size. Immunophenotyping provides diagnostic precision by detecting aberrant antigen expression on malignant PC, especially in patients with negative cytology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Normal PC express CD38 and CD138, while malignant PCs may also express CD19, CD45 or CD56 with light chain restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient demonstrated transudative pleural effusion with morphologically dysplastic PC positive for CD19, CD38, CD 138, CD45 and CD56.\n\n【18】Concomitant AF, elevated pro-BNP and LV hypertrophy raised the suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, which may also have contributed to the patient’s recurrent pleural effusion. Up to 30% of patients with MM have sub-clinical amyloid deposits, while 15% may suffer from overt amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cardiac amyloidosis may be diagnosed non-invasively by cardiac MRI or nuclear scintigraphy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Biopsy of endomyocardial tissue may be needed in equivocal cases or discordant data. Abdominal fat aspirate can be performed, where Congo red stain will detect 70–90% amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Large and persistent effusions refractory to diuretics and thoracentesis are likely caused by pleural amyloid infiltration by inhibition of pleural fluid absorption into the lymphatic circulation, the diagnosis of which may be demonstrated with pleural tissue biopsy via closed percutaneous route or thoracoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】MPE predicts poor outcomes with a short survival time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Treatment is directed at eliminating myeloma with systemic chemotherapy, while symptomatic therapy, such as diuretics, thoracentesis and pleurodesis, may provide some relief to improve the quality of life. Despite reduction in serum paraprotein with bortezomib-based chemotherapy, the patient required multiple admissions for thoracentesis and pleurodesis for the refractory effusion. In the era of novel agents, patients with extramedullary involvement respond poorly to therapy, indicating the biological differences between intramedullary and extramedullary disease.

Current treatment regimes propose Pegylated interferon-alpha for 48 weeks however sustained virological response (SVR) rates remain low. We report a patient who initially responded to Pegylated interferon treatment for HBV-HDV co-infection. Although initial improvement in viraemia from both virsues was seen, SVR was not achieved with ongoing progression of liver injury biochemically.

This case illustrates a successful treatment strategy for persistent HBV-HDV co-infection where proposed treatment regimes elicit an initial response but SVR is not achieved.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hepatitis delta infection is caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV) which requires the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, Hepatitis delta infection is either acquired simultaneously with, or as a superinfection to, existing HBV. Transmission routes are the same as for HBV, including percutaneous and sexual contact with blood products that are infected (and rarely vertical transmission from mother to child). Acute simultaneous HDV-HBV co-infection causes a hepatitis ranging in severity from mild to fulminant, however a complete recovery is usually seen, and <5% progress to chronic. In contrast, HDV superinfection on a background of established chronic HBV carries a much poorer prognosis in up to 90% of cases, accelerating the development of cirrhosis by almost a decade compared with chronic HBV alone.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Hepatitis B and D viral loads over time.</u>\n\n【5】HDV-HBV co-infection is seen in at least 5% of chronic HBV cases worldwide resulting in >15–20 million estimated cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, although this is thought to be an underestimation of the true prevalence. However, following a global vaccination programme for HBV, the overall number of HDV cases has decreased over the last four decades.\n\n【6】HDV-HBV co-infection is regarded as the most serious form of chronic viral hepatitis, leading to accelerated liver-related morbidity and mortality including hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HDV infection can be prevented successfully by HBV immunisation, current treatment options for established HDV infections have disappointing success rates. Current treatment regimes propose Pegylated interferon-alpha 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u> for 48 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> however sustained virological response (SVR) rates remain low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u> with no real advancement in treatment options over the last two decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】We report a patient who was successfully treated for HBV-HDV co-infection with two courses of Pegylated interferon leading to biochemical and virological response.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 42-year-old male with known HBV (diagnosed in Romania in 2011) presented to North Middlesex Hospital with deranged LFTs in September 2013. He did not drink alcohol or have any risk factors for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Subsequent investigations revealed a diagnosis of HBV-HDV co-infection, and histopathology was consistent with advanced fibrosis (Ishak stage 5) with severe portal inflammation. Viral loads of both viruses were detectable with HBV DNA of 39 iU/ml (e-antigen negative/e-antibody positive at presentation) and a rising HDV RNA of 6.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml going up to 8.8 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml.\n\n【10】Treatment with Pegylated interferon-alpha 3 was initiated in April 2014, and an initial encouraging response was documented with HDV RNA down to 220 iU/ml after 14 weeks of treatment. After 6 months, HBV DNA was undetectable and after 8 months, HDV RNA was also undetectable. The patient completed 12 months of treatment before unfortunately being lost to follow up and therefore SVR was not assessed.\n\n【11】Two years later, aged 45, he presented to Luton & Dunstable University hospital with a transaminitis (ALT 61). Although the liver looked radiologically unremarkable, a subsequent Fibroscan indicated F2 fibrosis (7.2 kPa). In addition, viral loads of both viruses had become detectable again (HDV RNA 77 iU/ml, HBV DNA 30 iU/ml). The suspicion that both viruses working in tandem were causing progressive liver damage prompted treatment with a second course of Pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (Pegasys).\n\n【12】Following this second course (which the patient stopped at 6 months due to non-compliance) he was essentially cured of his Hepatitis delta infection (HDV RNA undetectable, HDV IgM negative) with an SVR 12 months after completion of treatment . Furthermore, although Hepatitis B surface antigen remains positive and therefore functional cure has not been achieved, he became a very low level chronic HBV carrier (HBV DNA undetectable) as a result of the treatment. Finally, persistent biochemical normalization has been achieved.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】This is an interesting case because although the initial full course of treatment improved viraemia from both viruses, SVR was not achieved with persistent infection re-presenting as a transaminitis with Fibroscan evidence of ongoing fibrosis. Of note, advanced fibrosis was diagnosed histologically just 3 years prior to the Fibroscan which indicated F2 fibrosis in 2017. This may indicate improvement in fibrosis following initial treatment course (taking the differences in diagnostic modality into consideration), or may be as a result of potential overstating of fibrosis histologically (taking into account the significant improvement in fibrosis over only 3 years as indicated by the histology and subsequent Fibroscan). However, the summative effect of the second course, albeit for a subtherapeutic duration, appears to have achieved very low level HBV carrier status (with persistently undetectable viral load) and Hepatitis delta infection cure as well as biochemical normalisation.\n\n【15】A case described in the literature describes how functional cure of chronic HBV (with HBsAg clearance) as well as SVR of HDV infection was achieved after 12 years of treatment with interferon-alpha 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, subsequent literature including a meta-analysis comparing interferon-alpha, lamivudine and pegylated interferon-alpha for the treatment of HBV-HDV co-infection concluded that pegylated interferon-alpha led to superior SVR rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Two subsequent studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u> highlighted that longer courses of Pegylated interferon have superior SVR rates, however treatment is generally poorly tolerated, which is likely to impact compliance with longer courses. Furthermore, there is still a significant proportion of patients who do not achieve SVR after initial response to treatment with Pegylated interferon despite length of treatment as highlighted by these studies.\n\n【16】Although research into a superior therapy for HDV-HBV co-infection is ongoing, the lack of enzymatic proteins to target in the HDV means that conventional antiviral therapy has limited efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This case illustrates the cumulative effect of a ‘double hit’ of Pegylated interferon-alpha treatment as a successful treatment strategy for persistent HBV-HDV co-infection in patients who do not achieve SVR following initial treatment until a superior management option becomes available.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval is not required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Meha Bhuva.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sambit Sen.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No acknowledgments.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:55:59", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:56:56", "cost": 56.554}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:56:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:55:59"}

The cyst measured 54.7 × 33.4 × 55.0 mm . Normal kidneys and bladder were identified and were separate from the cyst. The amniotic fluid volume was normal. A female infant weighing 3085 g was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks’ gestation. Apgar scores at 1- and 5-min were 8 and 9, respectively. She had poor oxygenation owing to diaphragmatic compression by a giant hepatic cyst and required respiratory assistance with continuous positive airway pressure. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a clear unilocular cyst measuring 98 × 60 × 32 mm and occupying the right side of the abdomen, extending from the inferior aspect of the right liver lobe to the pelvis . The infant’s respiratory condition gradually improved, but the hepatic cyst did not regress spontaneously. We decided that neonatal treatment was desirable because of the symptoms such as apneic attack related to pressure on related structures caused by the cyst, and performed ultrasound-guided percutaneous hepatic cyst puncture drainage when the infant was 15 days old. The fluid inside the liver cyst was clear and contained no bile components. There was no continuity with the bile duct. The liver cyst decreased in size, but rapidly re-grew. The infant’s respiratory status was unstable, and she fed poorly, owing to compression by the hepatic cyst; therefore, we performed fenestration of the hepatic cyst when she was 43 days old. We performed laparotomy via an umbilical arc incision and punctured and aspirated the hepatic cyst contents . The cyst was abducted from the umbilical region, and the cyst wall was excised with an ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device . Laparoscopy confirmed that there was no liver injury or biliary fistula . She received a single-dose of cefazolin intravenously as a prophylactic antibiotic before surgery. Histopathologically, hepatocytes and connective tissue were found in the outer layer of the cyst, and dilated capillaries and lymphatic vessels were scattered throughout. Immunohistologically, the cells supporting the cyst showed the CKAE1/AE3, D2-40, calretinin, WT-1 were positive and CD34 and hepatocyte-1 were negative . The diagnosis was mesothelial cell-derived hepatic cyst. After the surgery, there were no complications and no respiratory assistance was required. Breastfeeding was resumed on the first postoperative day. One year after the operation, CT showed regeneration of liver tissue . We regularly follow her with ultrasonography and she has not had a recurrence for 3 years after her surgery. We show the umbilical wound 3 years after the surgery .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|CT image at 1 month after fenestration.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Umbilical incision 3 years after surgery (arrow).</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Congenital hepatic cysts in fetuses or newborns are relatively uncommon; however, routine ultrasound is detecting an increasing number of them prenatally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

The aforementioned hemiparesis resulted from an earlier (around 1976) hemorrhage of an AVM on the left hemisphere with accompanied intraventricular bleeding. The pupils were equal in size, reactive to light, and there was no relative afferent pupil defect. Moreover, an exophthalmus of the left eye was revealed as well as a known strabismus divergens and a facial nerve paresis on the right side. Furthermore, signs of meningeal irritation in form of a stiff and painful neck were detected. A brain computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted to investigate any intracranial pathology responsible for the headache symptoms as well as the hemiparesis. The results of the CT imaging were similar to those of 10 years ago, detecting no pathological findings. Thus, we proceeded with a cervical spine CT scan due to the accompanied cervical symptoms. The latter revealed an unstable fracture through the base of the dens, type II based on the Anderson and d’Alonzo classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There was no evidence of a spinal hematoma. Moreover, an extended osteolysis was revealed with reactive sclerosis of denses and axis’ endplate and margins, as shown in Figs 1 and 2 _._ The dens fracture was evaluated as a pathologic fracture. The fall incident could not explain the expanded osteolysis. Our assumption, based on the conducted imaging processes, is that the fracture was caused by a large AVM, which extended from the right side of the axis till the basis of the dens. The AVM also spread into the surrounding soft tissue.\n\n【11】During the hospitalization period, the neurological status of the patient remained unchanged, with persistent mobility difficulties. Taking into consideration the giant craniocervical AVM, the osteolysis of dens coupled with the decreased general condition of the patient, as well as her wish to avoid any kind of treatment, a conservative approach was chosen. The conservative treatment involved the adjustment of analgesics, a stiff neck collar for at least 6 weeks and regular application of physiotherapy.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Here, we publish a rare case of an osteolytic lesion caused by a giant AVM. Up to date, only a few case reports exist, describing a comparable condition. Our assumption is that the giant AVM gradually infiltrated the adjacent vertebral body causing osteolytic lesions over years. This assumption is based on the fact that the osteolysis was a previously unknown radiological finding of a known AVM and that the fall incident could not explain this finding. Due to the patient’s rejection of further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, an angiographic or histological confirmation of our assumption was not possible. For the same reason it was impossible to clarify the precise localization of the AVM. The lack of a comprehensive diagnostic control in order to exclude other types of osteolytic lesions, such as tumors, sets a limiting condition. Angiography remains the gold standard of depicting an AVM and cannot be replaced by the advanced imaging technique of CT.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the valuable contribution of all the clinical colleagues who contributed to the fulfillment of this work.

Availability of reports on PTs with size of 31 cm or more in diameter in the literature are extremely rare. Herein, the case of a 17-year-old female patient with a giant recurrent right breast PT is reported. Histologically, the tumour showed proliferation of stromal tumour cells consisting of spindle cells with uniform nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and proliferation labelling index for Ki67 of <10%. PTs require meticulous surgical excision due to the fact that they have a high rate of recurrence and status of surgical margins must be included in the pathology report. This is because recurrent cases of PTs tend to grow faster than the primary ones with a high chance of transforming to malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial tumours of the breast with incidence accounting for <1% of all breast tumours and 2.5% of fibroepithelial tumours, and they are classified as benign, borderline or malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These tumours are fast growing tumours and can reach a median size of 4 cm and sometimes can grow up to 50 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are few reported cases of PTs in adolescents. The mean age of PTs at diagnosis is 45 years (range 35–55 years) and commonly occur in third and fourth decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Until 2015, there were only 20 cases of PTs in adolescents that were already reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Approximately 70% of PTs are benign; however, 20% of them undergo malignant transformation whereas 10% are usually borderline at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Herein, an adolescent female with a highly recurrent and benign giant PT is being reported.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 17-year-old female was brought as an outpatient in the department of general surgery with a 2-year history of a huge ulcerating, painful and tender right breast mass. On physical examination, she was ill-looking, febrile and mildly wasted. She reported four different excisions in the past 2 years. Two excisions were done at a health centre and unfortunately the excised tumour masses were not evaluated histologically due to lack of pathology laboratory. The subsequent two excisions after recurrence were done at two different private hospitals. One histological report indicated fibroadenoma and the fourth report revealed benign PT. The right breast was very huge with ulcerating skin surface and was forming nodules . Ultrasound revealed a tumour, which measured 31 × 30 × 21 cm, calcified with regular borders and not fixed to the underlying tissue, but the left breast was normal. Chest X-ray showed clear lungs. Both fine-needle aspiration cytology and mammography could not be done because were not available. Modified radical mastectomy was performed by involving a significant amount of pectoralis major muscle. Macroscopically, the tumour was extensively necrotic, haemorrhagic and nodular. Grossly, the surgical margins were 3.4 cm far from the tumour . On microscopic examination, the tumour was hypercellular and was composed of uniform and slender spindle cells, and it was forming fascicles . The cells had uniform vesicular nuclear chromatin and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . A few mitotic figures <5 per 10 high-power fields were also seen . All ER, PR, HER2, SMA, S-100, vimentin and P53 antibodies were negative except Ki67 that showed proliferation labelling index of <10%. After a postoperative period of 8 months, she was found to be free from local recurrence or metastasis following evaluation with chest and abdominal computed tomography scan.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Clinical appearance of the lesion; ( **B** ) cut surface of the tumour is showing haemorrhage and necrosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **A** ) Stromal hypercellularity of the lesion.

About 20% of the patients have palpable axillary lymphadenopathy and a significant proportion of the patients have history of fibroadenoma with up to 20% of them being with high local recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis study done by Lu _et al_ . in China reported the pooled local recurrence rates for benign, borderline and malignant PTs to be 8, 13 and 18%, respectively. This shows that the tendency of PTs to recur locally increases with increase in aggressiveness of the tumour. The study also reported that mitoses, tumour border, stromal cellularity, stromal atypia, stromal overgrowth and tumour necrosis can independently predict development of local recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The categorization of PTs into benign, borderline and malignant was described in the study by Salvadori _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Confirmation of diagnosis of PTs is done by histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Mammographically, PTs are clearly defined masses with a smooth and occasionally lobulated border, whereas on ultrasound they often show smooth contours with low-level homogenous internal echoes, intramural cysts without posterior acoustic enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Mammographically, both PTs and fibroadenoma show coarse microcalcification, but ‘malignant’ microcalcification in PTs is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It has been found that the presence of both epithelial and stromal elements within the cytological smear supports the diagnosis of PTs and not fibroadenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Surgery is the initial treatment for PTs with preferred wide excision for clear surgical margins, particularly for malignant ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The mean time for local recurrence has been reported to be around 2 years. This is different from the present case in which there were three consecutive local recurrences within a period of 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Options for failure to obtain negative surgical margins include re-excision, radical resection of the chest wall and reconstruction using a composite mesh (inner polytetrafluoroethylene and outer vypro), pedicle latissimus dorsi flap and a split skin graft for the recurrent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiotherapy have no proven benefits in the treatment of PT in regards to its recurrence and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In a study by Kario _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> reported that stromal overgrowth increases the possibility of local recurrence by seven times, whereas surgical margin <1 cm increases the risk by five times.\n\n【14】The case described in this report sheds light on the importance of evaluating histologically all excised breast lumps in order to confirm the diagnosis and not generalizing that every benign looking breast lump is fibroadenomas. This may help to avoid missing of the proper diagnosis as it was in the present case. This report also explains the importance of wide local excision for giant PTs (>10 cm in diameter), which helps to prevent local recurrence.\n\n【15】In summary, PTs are extremely rare in adolescents and they grow rapidly with a high risk of local recurrence. Ensuring wide excision during surgery is of utmost importance for obtaining negative surgical margins in order to prevent possibility of local recurrence.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author confirms that he had obtained a written informed consent from the patient’s parents for publication of the case details and any accompanying images.

The development of tolerance and immunogical effects of these agents in people living with HIV are not well assessed as these persons are often excluded from clinical trials. Herein, we report a case of a Caucasian woman who received multiple sequential immunotherapies for severe ulcerative colitis. Due to steroid-refractory disease, receipt of maximal doses of mesalamine and initial repeated decline of surgical intervention, she went on to receive biologic immune inhibitors like tumor necrosis fator-α blockers infliximab and adalimumab, the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab, anti-interleukin 12/23 blocker ustekinumab and Janus Kinase inihibitor tofacitinib without achieving remission. Only minor infectious complications were encountered and no significant changes in CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio occurred. This case provides support for the safety and tolerability of the above immunotherapies in people living with HIV with suppressed viral load on antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), one provides immunosuppressive therapy with the hope of tempering excessive inflammation while preserving immune function. However, if the proper balance between immunosuppression and immune preservation is not achieved, an individual will be tipped into immunodeficiency with increased infection risk. People living with HIV (PLWH) are often excluding from clinical trials involving biologics based on concerns of additive immunosuppression and infection risk. Consequently, little data are available to guide clinicians in managing PLWH who suffer from advanced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, we present the case of young woman with HIV infection and extensive UC refractory to many therapies. Following repeated decline of surgical intervention, she was treated with multiple sequential immunomodulators and did not experience any major adverse effects.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old, Canadian-born Caucasian woman was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. She began antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil 300 mg/emtracitabine 200 mg orally once daily and raltegravir 400 mg orally twice daily in 2012, when her CD4 count rapidly dropped to 86 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Later that year, she began experiencing frequent episodes of bloody diarrhea, with up to 20 stools daily, with cramping, rectal bleeding and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Stool was repeatedly negative for _Clostridium difficile_ and ova and parasites. Colonoscopy demonstrated severe pancolitis and biopsies consistent with active UC with acute cryptitis, crypt abcesses with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal erosions, acute inflammatory exudate with architectural disortion. Hematoxylin and eosin stains for cytomegalovirus and histochemical exams for Herpes Simplex Virus I/II were negative. Despite high doses of oral prednisone (40–60 mg daily) and several emergency room visits to receive intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for flares, she was deemed steroid-refractory.\n\n【6】Later that year, she received maximum doses of oral mesalamine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as mesalamine suppositories and enemas. She then received infliximab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012–2013)</u>, an antitumor necrois fator-α (anti-TNFα) monoclonal antibody, until antibody formation. Despite maximum doses of adalimumab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u>, her UC remained refractory although no antibodies were detected using a drug-tolerant assay and medication levels were therapeutic (>12 μg/ml, the highest limit of detection). Attempts to taper her steroids resulted in flare-ups and a cushingoid feature. She declined colectomy as she felt this would interfere with her lifestyle, especially since she was getting married, and concerns about her future fertility.\n\n【7】One of the options explored was the use of vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against α4β7 integrin, via a clinical trial. However, due to the patient’s HIV infection she was not eligible to participate in any of the recruiting trials at the centre as HIV infection is frequently an exclusion criteria. Colonoscopy in 2015 revealed severe inflammation with ulcerations and friability consistent with Mayo 3 colitis, despite high-dose steroids and adalimumab, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 80 mg weekly. By December 2015, vedolizumab was obtained through standard of care and initiated at 300 mg IV at weeks 0 and 2, 6 (loading dose) and then every 8 weeks thereafter as a maintenance dose. She was still bleeding from the rectum and had decreased weight, therefore daily prednisone 10 mg orally was maintained. She achieved clinical remission by March 2016 and steroids were stopped. Two months later, she developed right foot cellulitis following a minor trauma during a pedicure and required 48 hours of IV followed by oral antibiotics.\n\n【8】Colonoscopy in June 2016, 3 months after stopping steroids, showed worsening condition with Mayo 3 colitis, so she was changed to vedolizumab 300 mg IV q 4 weeks and prednisone increased to 40 mg orally (po) daily. Anti-α4β7 antibodies were not detected. She was passing bright red blood per rectum 12 times in 24 hours and having five stools per 24 hours with lower abdominal cramping and rectal pain. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinab 10 mg po twice daily, was initiated October 2016 and prednisone 40 mg po daily maintained. Symptoms persisted requiring admission for IV prednisolone, but she continued to decline surgical colectomy. She also developed a bacterial vaginitis treated with metronidazole cream and later a skin furuncle, treated with oral antibiotics.\n\n【9】Following tofacitinib, she received interleukin 12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab March–September 2017. She gained 30 pounds in 1 year (body mass index 37), increased abdominal fat and bilateral cataracts due to cortisone. Attempts to decrease prednisone below 30 mg daily led to bloody diarrhea (12–17 bowel movements daily))</u> with rectal stump and temporary end ileostomy by June 2018. She improved and was seen for follow-up a month post-op, at which time she was having increasing right lower quadrant pain and rising CRP. A computed tomography scan demonstrated collections in the subcutaneous fat surrounding the ostomy and a second collection centimeter with rim enhancement and fat stranding. These were drained and cultures grew _E. coli_ and _B. fragilis_ . She responded to IV antibiotics for 3 days followed by oral step-down antibiotics to complete 2 weeks. Eight months following her colectomy, she developed polyarthralgia in her interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, knees and feet with a normal CRP and a negative Rheumatoid Factor while off prednisone, thought to be either inflammatory or mechanical polyarthralgia. Pathology on surveillance sigmoidoscopy March 2019 demonstrated chronic active proctitis with ulceration consistent with chronic idiopathic IBD. Throughout this entire time, her CD4 range was between 400 and 900 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.41:1.12, and HIV viral load remained suppressed since November 2012.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Colonic resection histology. The colonic mucosa shows characteristic features of chronic ulcerative colitis including crypt architecture alteration, cryptitis, crypt abscess and focal mucosa ulceration. There is no evidence of dysplasia.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Due to repeated decline of surgery in order to preserve her quality of life and fertility, this woman with HIV and refractory UC received all available conventional therapies including mesalamine, glucocorticoids, thiopurines, antagonists to TNF- α, IL-12/23 blockers and anti-α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin. She also received a small-molecule JAK inhibitor. TNF-α inhibitors and α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blockers are used with extreme caution in PLWH due to concerns of additional immunosuppression and subsequent infection risk. However, during her 6 years of being on immunosuppressants, the patient only experienced one episode of cellulitis, bacterial vaginosis, a skin furuncle and peristomal abscesses, all of which were easily managed with traditional therapies. Another concern with the use of integrin receptor antagonists in PLWH, although rare, is the possibility of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy due to John Cunningham (JC) virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent blood plasma JC virus testing prior to vedolizumab initiation and this polymerase chain reaction testing was negative. She also denied any neurological signs or symptoms throughout treatment.\n\n【13】This woman’s case demonstrates that the spectrum of drug classes available and sequential use of biologics for treatment of UC were safe in this patient with well-controlled HIV infection ART, including an TNF-α blocker, JK inhibitor, IL-12/23 blocker and the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab. Our patient did not incur any significant changes in her CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio during the course of her treatments and infections were relatively minor. Although we did not use combination biologics in this patient, their efficacy and safety for IBD and other and other inflammatory diseases associated was explored in a systematic review of observational studies which did not find any differences related to improvements in disease condition, adverse effects or infection rates in patients receiving combined treatment compared to placebo groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A clinical trial (NCT02764762) examining efficacy and safety of combined vedolizumab, adalimumab and oral methotrexate in patients with Crohn’s Disease is in progress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Until evidence from clinical trials is available on efficacy and safety of biologics and combination therapy in PLWH, case reports and case series provide a channel for dissemination of these experiences within the medical community.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Pathologist, Dr Zu-hua Gao, for provision of the histology image.

A new risk factor for this infection is COVID-19 which facilitates mucormycosis by different mechanisms. The rhino-orbito-cerebral involvement is the most common form. Involvement of other anatomical regions may occur in rare situations. As we presented here, a 51-year-old woman presented with respiratory distress and subglottic lesion during COVID-19 (Delta variant) treatment which was diagnosed by histopathological examination as a subglottic mucormycosis postoperatively. The patient underwent tracheostomy and debridement of the necrotic tissues followed by antifungal treatment. New manifestations of COVID-19 are appearing over time. The association between coronavirus and mucormycosis of the laryngeal and airway region must be given serious consideration.

The rhino–orbito–cerebral form of mucormycosis is the most common form which is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Although, pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare manifestation detected in patients with hematological malignancies and transplant recipients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of mucormycosis is characterized by the presence of angioinvasion of Mucorales hyphae and also with culture confirmation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. Mucormycosis is an opportunistic infection and usually a rare condition. Uncontrolled DM and other immunosuppressive conditions such as neutropenia and corticosteroid therapy are known risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A new recognized risk factor for this opportunistic infection is the rampant use of corticosteroids in a background of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which facilitates mucormycosis by different mechanisms including, low oxygen and acidotic environment, high iron and glucose level and impaired function of phagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although it affects most commonly the paranasal sinuses, the presence of mucormycosis in the laryngeal tract is a very rare condition. In this context, we review a rare case of subglottic invasive mucormycosis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old woman presented with malaise, fever and shortness of breath 4 weeks before admission. She had a history of DM and hypothyroidism and was treated with Metformin and Levothyroxine. She had no history of COVID-19 exposure. Physical examination revealed a conscious woman with no respiratory distress. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 105/70 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats/min, body temperature 38.2°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and no pulmonary rales nor crackles. Although, the initial laboratory test showed poor controlled DM (fasting blood sugar: 245 mg/dl and HbA1C: 11). A Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was done and revealed multilobar ground glass opacification, which was in favor of COVID-19 infection . She was admitted to the ward based on peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88% and received 4–5 l per minute of oxygen nasally. Dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day/IV and Remdesivir 200 mg stat and then 100 mg daily/intravenous (IV) were started. Also, she was given regular and NPH insulin, and they were adjusted every day to control plasma glucose. RT-PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2; COVID-19 Delta variant). During the course of treatment, on September 22 at 4:00 P.M, she developed mild hot potato speech, dyspnea and subtle respiratory distress. Indirect laryngoscopy could not be done due to severe pooling and lack of patient’s cooperation. As her symptoms worsen over time, a spiral chest, PNS and neck CT scan with IV contrast was done and revealed normal paranasal sinuses and the lung parenchyma, with resolved pulmonary opacities. Soft tissue swelling of the right side of the supraglottis, glottis and subglottis were depicted on the neck CT scan. A non-enhancing soft tissue in favor of necrosis was visible in the posterior subglottis, with extra laryngeal extension posterior to the upper trachea . Based on the initial impression of bacterial subglottis infection, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) were started giving an infectious disease consultation, other treatment was continued with close observation. Initially, her respiration got better, but over the next 2 days, her breathing became progressively labored. Video laryngoscopy was done and revealed a yellowish lesion in the subglottic area . She underwent an emergency awake tracheostomy. Following tracheostomy, direct laryngoscopy revealed ~1\\*1.5 cm white to yellowish lesion similar to crusting and necrosis in the subglottis. Multiple biopsies were taken and sent to the laboratory for histopathological and mycological evaluations. Microscopic examination showed scattered areas of necrosis infiltrated by numerous large, branching non-septate hyphae. The hyphae mostly demonstrated significant branching at 90-degree angles. Also, scattered inflammatory cells infiltration was seen in surrounding vital tissue. Additional ancillary histochemical staining (Periodic Acid Schiff—PAS- and Grocott’s Methenamine Silver—GMS) confirmed the presence of the fungal hyphae throughout the specimen, in favor of mucormycosis . Dexamethasone was discontinued and she was given liposomal amphotericin B 250 mg/IV/daily. The follow-up laryngoscopy showed a subglottic lesion about 1-week post-operation. Therefore, she underwent another direct laryngoscopy with debridement of the subglottic necrosis. The following indirect video laryngoscopy after about 1 week after the second debridement showed no sign of any necrosis or lesion. The general condition of the patient was completely improved after 4 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B and there was no evidence of recurrence during the outpatient follow-ups after 4 weeks of oral Posaconazole (5 cc/every 6 h) .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Chest CT scan was done and revealed multilobar ground glass opacification, which was in favor of COVID-19.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Axial contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck depicts soft tissue swelling of the right side of the supraglottis, the glottis and the subglottis.

There are only a few reports that described subglottic mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8–11 \\]</u> and its prevalence is unknown. Depending on the underlying conditions and the risk factors, mucormycosis have a specific predilection to affect common anatomic sites like sinus, orbit and respiratory tracts in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Wolf _et al._ reported a poor control DM patient with an intraluminal mucormycosis in the first tracheal ring that was treated after infected tissue resection and prolonged amphotericin B 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In another report Mohindra _et al._ described a female DM patient with tracheal mucormycosis after H1N1 influenza 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It seems that like our case DM is the main predisposing condition correlated with upper respiratory mucormycosis.\n\n【13】The differential diagnosis for the necrotic lesion in subglottis includes secondary ischemic injury to the tracheal wall due to prolonged intubation, neoplastic lesions (chondrosarcoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and lymphoproliferative disorders), inflammatory diseases (Wegener’s granulomatosis and sarcoidosis) and infectious disease (bacterial, tuberculosis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>). Biopsy of the lesion is important for precise diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【14】Current guidelines recommend a combined medical and surgical approach for achieving the best outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Liposomal amphotericin B is the mainstay antifungal treatment for mucormycosis. Surgical debridement of the involved area in conjunction with antifungal treatment is also necessary as performed in this case and the in older reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The mortality rate and survival of the patients with mucormycosis depend on several factors. Although, many studies reported a high mortality rate for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14–16 \\]</u> but the severity of underlying medical disorders, early initiation of antifungal therapy and effective surgical debridement have key roles in the prognosis of the patients. Surgical debridement without reversing the immunocompromised conditions is not adequate and may lead to disseminated disease and also required repeated debridement. Even one study demonstrated that controlling the underlying DM, and antifungal therapy without surgical debridement is a good treatment option in localized diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, special consideration should be given to the underlying immunosuppression status and stop the rampant use of corticosteroid because mucormycosis usually do not affect an immunocompetent person. Furthermore, it has been shown that patients with tracheal mucormycosis and limited pulmonary involvement have better survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Our patients had isolated subglottis involvement without rhino–orbito–cerebral or pulmonary mucormycosis. Fortunately, early diagnosis and combined antifungal therapy and serial surgical debridement of necrotic tissues in conjunction with aggressive control of the blood glucose and also, discontinuation of dexamethasone are the keys to our successful outcome.\n\n【16】The interesting aspects of this case were the presence of mucormycosis in a rare anatomical site with atypical clinical presentation. The patient developed the symptoms in a period of active COVID-19 (Delta variant) disease. The management of the patient was similar to current guidelines.\n\n【17】During the COVID-19 era, any necrotic tissue in the airways in immunocompromised patients should raise suspicion of mucormycosis and be diagnosed early with a rapid biopsy of the affected area.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The project received institutional research ethics board approval prior to the beginning of the study from the Otolaryngology Research Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex Ethics Board.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MSZ and BA did the tracheostomy, tissue debridement of the patient and gathered the necessary data and were the major contributor in writing the manuscript.

GMPC often manifests with obstructive urinary symptoms, urinary retention or pelvic pain. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice, however, not all patients are suitable for a surgical intervention, thereby presenting a case for alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment options. In this report, we present the first case of a patient in whom GMPC was concurrently diagnosed with an unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), with both lesions showing complete resolution following a 3-year course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old male was referred to our center for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion for localized PCa with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 8.0 ng/ml.

On the right side, the locules were of intermediate T2 signal with areas of restricted diffusion, likely relating to blood products. On the left side, the locules showed higher T2 signal with no restricted diffusion, and areas of low T1 or high T1 signal intensity, likely relating to either simple fluid or proteinaceous material, respectively. No imaging features of local invasion were observed, with the described radiological appearance being in keeping with GMPC. A subsequent flexible cystoscopy showed no invasion of the mass into the bladder, and no malignant cells were seen on diagnostic cytology. The patient was prescribed an LHRH agonist with a 3-month interval MRI demonstrating a significant reduction in size of GMPC, then measuring 43 × 29 × 40 mm (26)</u>** .

The 4-fold reduction in the GMPC volume reported after the initial 3-month ADT, alongside its further reduction seen on EBRT computed tomography (CT) planning scan, highlight the key role of castration in the observed phenomenon, likely driven by targeting the androgen receptor, which is known to be expressed on GMPC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These findings are in line with the single published report of noninvasive treatment of recurrent unresectable GMPC with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which also demonstrated a positive result, with no further recurrence observed on continuous ADT. In the present report, interim EBRT could also have an add-on effect on GMPC resolution, e.g. by means of destroying its feeding vessel. Overall, these findings suggest that ADT is effective in treating both primary and recurrent GMPC, thereby serving as a promising alternative to invasive surgical treatment.\n\n【12】GMPC can be diagnosed at any age between 16 and 80 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with its presenting symptoms being similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including lower urinary symptoms, urinary retention, hematuria and elevated serum PSA levels.

T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging may provide additional information on the presence and the nature of any GMPC soft tissue components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Being aware of radiological features of GMPC, alongside other pelvic masses or congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract, is of considerable clinical relevance given the increasing use of MRI for diagnosis, local staging and follow-up imaging of PCa, which may lead to a more frequent incidental detection of this rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Additionally, to our knowledge, the concomitant diagnosis of GMPC and biopsy-proven PCa demonstrated in this report has not been presented previously.\n\n【13】As there are no pathognomonic histopathological signs of GMPC that could enable its confident diagnosis by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, it is important to consider several differential diagnoses that include other lower male genitourinary tract cysts (Müllerian, prostatic, seminal vesicle and utricle), prostatic leiomyoma, lymphangioma, teratoma, liposarcoma, hydatid disease and phyllodes variant of atypical prostatic hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Given the size and possible adherence to surrounding organs, complete surgical excision of GMPC, which is required to prevent the disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, often becomes a traumatic operation with major complications being bladder and rectum perforation, pelvic abscess, anal canal injury and rectal leak 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. As evidenced by this report, a short-term ADT course may be used as a preoperative volume-reducing step aimed at decreasing the invasiveness of GMPC surgical removal. In cases when radical treatment is contraindicated or can be avoided due to the mild nature of GMPC-related symptoms, strong consideration should be given to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option capable of achieving complete GMPC resolution.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】In conclusion, we reported the first case of complete regression of a GMPC observed on consecutive MRI scans following 3 years of ADT with an LHRH agonist. The reported observation warrants further attention to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option for patients with GMPC in whom complete surgical resection is either contraindicated or can be deferred.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this report.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent to publish the anonymized MR images was obtained in writing.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The guarantor of the study is Dr Tristan Barrett.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:06:49", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:07:49", "cost": 59.803}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:07:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:06:50"}

This was reported to be a sign of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). On Day 13, due to poor clinical progression and multiple negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for COVID-19, an alternative diagnosis was sought. Subsequently, this led to a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. This case demonstrates complicating factors in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the presence of cognitive bias during a pandemic, which may lead clinicians to overlook a diagnosis, which may otherwise be addressed earlier.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Typically it presents with fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, in addition to ground-glass opacities (GGO) on chest computed tomography (CT) typically in the peripheries, but can be seen to vary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which occurs due to the opportunistic fungal pathogen _Pneumocystis jirovecii._ Historically, it is associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), however, due to increasing use of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence is now greater in non-HIV associated cases of, for example, malignancy and immunosuppression, which have a higher rate of mortality, reported between 30% and 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Typically it presents with exertional dyspnoea, fever and non-productive cough, with bilateral GGO on chest CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is commonly in a central distribution but can vary and be in a more diffuse pattern, alongside less common findings of consolidation, nodules and cystic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】This case presented difficulties in diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting lessons to be learnt.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 52-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of worsening abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. On examination she was peritonitic, tachycardic, hypotensive and tachypnoeic with a new oxygen requirement of 4 L.\n\n【8】She had a history of lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases diagnosed 3 months prior to this presentation, for which she had a craniotomy with resection of metastases and cyberknife radiotherapy. In addition, she was on a weaning regime of oral dexamethasone for the brain metastases, on 2 mg three times a day at presentation, reduced from 8 mg twice daily over the prior 3 months since the diagnosis of malignancy. She had no other significant past medical history and the only other medications she took were lansoprazole for gastric protection whilst on dexamethasone and hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. She had not started other treatments for her malignancy prior to this presentation.\n\n【9】Imaging demonstrated perforation of the large bowel secondary to diverticulitis, and a coincidental finding of bilateral, patchy GGO of both the central and peripheral lung fields. This was reported to be a probable sign of COVID-19 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[ Fig 1 and 2 \\]</u>. Subsequently, she underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and ileostomy formation.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|A coronal slice of CT chest showing bilateral ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|An axial slice of CT chest showing bilateral ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n【12】Post-operatively, due to the chest CT findings, she was managed as COVID-19 positive. Five reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 tests, however, were negative (nose/throat swabs on Days 1 and 10, bronchoalveolar lavage samples on Days 2 and 4, endotracheal secretions on Day 13). On Day 13, due to poor clinical progression preventing successful post-operative extubation, with increasing bilateral areas of ground glass changes on CT, persistently raised inflammatory markers and ongoing pyrexia (despite broad antibiotic cover), an alternative diagnosis was sought to explain the chest CT findings. A screening for alternative respiratory infections was carried out, which detected _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ DNA in sputum and Beta D gluten antigen in serum.\n\n【13】Subsequently, the patient was commenced on 21 days of co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP, resulting in significant clinical improvement and hospital discharge.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】This case highlights two discussion points.\n\n【16】The first is the diagnosis of COVID-19, due to the discrepancy between the multiple negative RT-PCR tests and the chest CT that was reported as possible COVID-19. This discrepancy is discussed in a systematic review of the accuracy of RT-PCR testing at the time, which concluded that false negative results ranged from 2% to 29% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In addition, a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, found that in patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% had positive chest CT findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Subsequently, they concluded that a chest CT had a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in comparison to RT-PCR from swab samples, and made the suggestion that CT should be considered as the primary diagnostic tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The second is the diagnosis of PCP, which arguably should have been on the early list of differentials for a number of reasons.\n\n【18】First, the patient was potentially at risk of developing PCP due to the use of dexamethasone without PCP prophylaxis. This use of corticosteroid prior to the development of PCP is found in up to 90% of cases, and guidelines suggest the use of prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole when a patient is receiving more than the equivalent of 20 mg of prednisolone a day for >4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, her risk of developing PCP may have been compounded by her underlying malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Second, the bilateral GGO on CT that were reported to be a probable sign of COVID-19 were arguably more in keeping with PCP which has a more central distribution in comparison to the peripheries in COVID-19, however, this can vary in distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The diagnosis of PCP in this case may have been influenced by the presence of cognitive bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cognitive bias refers to the unconscious thoughts and behaviours that influence decision-making 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. ‘Availability bias’, in particular, which is the influence of observing a high prevalence of a particular disease, such as COVID-19 during the pandemic may have played a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Subsequently, with COVID-19 at the forefront of the clinician’s mind, additional diagnoses of COVID-19 may have been made prior to the consideration of differentials, for example, those that cause GGO on CT, not only limited to PCP, such as influenza pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】In conclusion, with SARS-CoV-2 likely to become endemic in our society, it is crucial that we continue to enhance our knowledge of COVID-19 to improve our diagnosis and management. Furthermore, with the possibility of pandemics becoming a more common occurrence, it is paramount that clinicians maintain an awareness of the presence of cognitive bias in diagnosis during a pandemic. Similar cases in which cognitive bias has influenced clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic are not widely discussed in the literature. This should arguably receive more attention to allow clinicians to address their clinical practice to reduce such biases. These biases may otherwise result in a delay in reaching the correct diagnosis, which could be fatal.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEGMENT\n-------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no funding to report for this submission.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N/A</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors stated in the manuscript, accept full responsibility for the work, had access to the data, and controlled the decision to publish.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:38", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:43:54", "cost": 16.123}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:30", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:43:38"}

One of the poor prognostic indicators of breast cancer is distant metastasis, with bone and brain being the most frequent metastatic sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

The average time to gastric metastasis after the diagnosis of breast cancer is reported to be within 5–10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, with an average survival time after gastric metastasis diagnosis to be as short as 7 months (0 to 41 months), even in uncomplicated cases.

In this report, we describe a case of gastric metastasis from a primary breast cancer occurring 20 years after mastectomy.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 79-year-old woman who had undergone a left breast mastectomy 20 years ago presented with epigastric discomfort. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography at our hospital revealed a thickened gastric wall and type 4 advanced gastric cancer without direct invasion of the surrounding organs. In addition, there was no obvious lymph node enlargement; however, evidence of suspected bone metastasis in the thoracic vertebrae and sciatica were found. Endoscopic findings from the previous physician showed stiffness and enlarged folds of the gastric body, and histopathological examination led to the diagnosis of linitis plastica gastric cancer. She was then referred to our hospital for close examination and treatment of type 4 advanced gastric cancer. Although mastectomy was performed many years ago and the symptoms were not typical, we performed an EGD again in consideration of gastric metastasis of breast carcinoma. Biopsy samples were taken from the lesion in the gastric body , and from the antrum, which appeared normal on EGD . All biopsy sites showed signet-ring cell carcinoma infiltration. IHC revealed diffuse nuclear expressions of estrogen receptor and GATA binding protein 3 in the neoplastic cells, whereas E-cadherin was mostly negative in the neoplastic cell membranes . Chest and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormal findings in the right breast, and this case was considered to have gastric metastasis due to postoperative recurrence of left breast cancer. This is a very rare case of breast cancer observed 20 years after mastectomy. IHC led to a definitive diagnosis, and chemotherapy was decided. Currently, she is on oral therapy with 2.5 mg/day letrozole. During the course of treatment, she presented with cellulitis of the left upper extremity for a time, which improved, and she is continuing her current treatment with no side effects of chemotherapy or significant elevation of tumor markers.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|**Endoscopic images** The gastric body mainly exhibits gastric wall stiffness and poor wall distension (a), with no erosions or ulcerations suggestive of a primary lesion; normal mucosa is observed in the pyloric antrum (b).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|**Metastasis of breast cancer to the stomach** Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows an infiltrating adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features in the gastric lamina propria; IHC reveals diffuse nuclear expressions of estrogen receptor and GATA binding protein 3 in the neoplastic cells, whereas E-cadherin is mostly negative in the neoplastic cell membranes.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】The common metastatic organs affected by breast cancer include bone, brain, liver and lung. Gastric metastasis from breast cancer is very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, a few cases of gastric metastases from breast cancer have been reported, and it is often difficult to distinguish between primary or metastatic gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Accurate diagnosis of both is very important in determining the course of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two based on clinical course, endoscopic findings and imaging studies. IHC is considered as an important differentiating factor in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, GATA binding protein 3, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, mammaglobin, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 and E-cadherin leads to a definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. It has been reported that the average period of diagnosis of gastric metastasis after the diagnosis of primary breast cancer is ~7 years (ranging 0–13 years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In other words, cases of gastric metastasis 20 years after mastectomy are relatively rare. In female patients with suspected gastric cancer, it is always important to consider the possibility of gastric metastasis from breast cancer. Therefore, performing additional IHC should be considered, regardless of breast cancer or treatment history.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n---------------------------</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author (RJ) upon reasonable request.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank our study participants for their invaluable contribution to this project.

He was the first child in the family, born at term weighing 4 kg, following a normal pregnancy. There were no concerns in the neonatal period. At 10 months old, he suffered from fever measured at (39.5–40)°C at a rate of 2 to 3 times daily, partly controlled with antipyretic, associated with difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the pediatric department for 72 days. During admission, he had extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and needed oxygen. He was diagnosed with staphylococcal pneumonia and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. At 14 months old, he was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks with a lung infection requiring an invasive ventilator for 1 week. There was not any other medical, surgical or family history. He was passive exposure to tobacco smoke. The child underwent all the compulsory immunizations recommended for his age. On physical examination, his body weight was 14 kg (90.32%), length was 85 cm (58.706%), temperature 39°C, oxygen Saturation 95%, arterial blood pressure was 90/55 mm Hg, he was vitally stable and generally well. The patient underwent multiple investigations that showed hypochromic microcytic anemia \\[Hb 10 g/dl, MCV 59 fl\\] with an inflammatory response \\[C- reactive protein (CRP) 52 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84 mm at the end of 1st hour\\]. Other investigations including hepatic and renal function, blood glucose, and blood gas urinary investigations were normal. Chest X-Ray showed cloudy bilateral infiltrations . Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue . Echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), abdominal ultrasound, and direct investigation of Bacillus Koch in sputum on three-morning samples were performed that were normal. Pulmonary pressure was normal. Cystic fibrosis mutations, Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM) and alpha 1 Antitrypsin were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest-X-Ray demonstrating bilateral hazy infiltrates.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue.</u>\n\n【8】During the hospitalization, subcutaneous emphysema appeared in the neck  with nearly confluent erythematous macules and papules like seborrhea dermatitis appeared throughout the scalp and expanded to the back and abdomen . Histologic examination of a punch biopsy obtained which showed focal surface erosion with diffuse and nodular dermal infiltration by atypical relatively large cells, histiocytic like, with moderate eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm and slightly irregular or grooved nuclei. Some areas of the tumor show significant mitotic activity. Most of the tumor cells are found to be positive for S100 protein, and numerous ones of tumor cells are positive for CD68 that would confirm the diagnosis for LCH.

At this stage, the disease was in a regressive state and the patient proceeded to the second-line continuation chemotherapy consisting of three drugs (oral prednisone pulses, every three  weeks vinblastine and etoposide \\[Vp16\\]). He completed the 52 weeks of the continuation phase, and recent imaging confirmed that he still has the non-active disease.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】LCH is an unknown etiology, with several hypotheses that investigate whether it has a neoplastic or inflammatory origin, immunological, genetic or infectious (mainly viral) as triggering factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Historically, the first case of LSD was described by Letterer in 1924 and then defined the clinic pathological syndrome by Siwe in 1933 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. LSD usually appears within the first two years of life as cutaneous lesions in the scalp, face, thorax and perineum that are similar to seborrheic dermatitis. Many systemic symptoms may include ear drainage, anemia, fever, lymphadenopathy, osteolytic lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Pulmonary LCH (PLCH) includes cough, tachypnea, cyanosis, clubbing, hemoptysis or it may be asymptomatic. Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema are lower incidences in infancy compared with adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】In our case report, the pulmonary symptoms (recurrent pulmonary infections, subcutaneous emphysema) were the predominant symptoms, then the cutaneous lesions appeared and this considers rare in the literature. In the early stage of PLCH, chest X-ray reveals diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltration, symmetric linear and nodular opacities that develop in the later stage to cystic, bullous formation and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although the condition is not chronic in our patient, damage to the pulmonary tissue was significant. The diagnosis is detected through the lung or other affected tissues biopsy that appears accumulation of Langerhans cells with variable numbers of eosinophils. Langerhans cells are immunohistochemically positive with antibodies to S-100 protein and CD1a 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Treatment of LSD depends on the number of organs affected. The treatment ranges from minimal therapy to intensive chemotherapy (Vinblastine and etoposide) associated with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In summary, this was a rare case report of LSD with unusual clinical presentation. The diagnosis was based on histological examination and immunophenotyping of the biopsied tissue.

A 62-year-old male physician presented to emergency room with chest discomfort followed by thought to be normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and normal echocardiography results. His serial hs-troponin test showed remarkable escalation three hours from the initial (107 ng/l into 4.978 ng/l), suggesting a high-risk non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). An early invasive procedure was performed, showing acute total occlusion (TO) in the obtuse marginal 1 branch. We retrospectively reviewed our examination to diagnose better the presence of TO in NSTEMI patients presented with non-diagnostic examination. Our evaluation showed a minor change in the form of an ‘N-wave’ pattern on the ECG, which was not yet an established guideline criterion for prompt angiography. Although ECG pattern is often normal in LCx occlusion, recent study shows the presence of ‘N-wave’ ECG pattern in 10% of NSTEMI cases following TO at LCx.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential diagnostic tool in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as its availability and usability in determining the involvement of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). Unfortunately, over 25.5% of total occlusions (TO) present without classic ST-T changes on the surface ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–4 \\]</u>. These subgroups of patients are identified as STEMI-equivalent, one of whom was characterized by the presence of an N-wave. N-waves are present in 10% of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients and associated with an equivalent risk with STEMI patients. The recognition of N-waves can be helpful to determine urgent revascularization. The study conducted by Meyers _et al_ . stated that ECG findings other than ST-elevation criteria could identify TO sooner and more accurately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 62-year-old male physician presented to the emergency room with a 2-hour history of migratory discomfort involving epigastric, back and central chest. The pain was episodic, non-radiating and migrated from place to place. He initially had a one-month history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption due to toothache. He used self-prescribed intravenous anti-dyspepsia, anti-spasmodic, sublingual nitrates and even a Fentanyl patch to relieve his symptoms. The treatment obscured the major complaint, with a 7/10 score on the pain scale. As he seemed anxious, 2 mg of morphine was given to relieve symptoms.\n\n【6】The patient was alert and had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and previous chest pain. His physical examination was within the normal limits, with blood pressure 130/84 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, oxygen saturation 94% (room air) and respiratory rate 20 per minute.\n\n【7】ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm without signs of ischemia . Blood samples showed an increase in troponin (107 ng/l), which drove suspicion of ACS. Further cardiac examination was planned with the re-evaluation of possible ECG changes, 3-hour cardiac troponin (cTn) samples and echocardiogram.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|electrocardiogram performed during examination in ED.

The echocardiogram  showed normal cardiac chambers with no regional wall motion abnormalities.\n\n【12】Clinical, ECG and echocardiography examinations weren’t diagnostic for Myocardial Infarction (MI) as HEART score classified him as low risk (Risk of MACE 0.9–1.7%). However, there was a remarkable escalation of repeated hs-Troponin (4978 ng/l), which is associated with high-risk NSTEMI. According to our laboratory protocol, the repeated hs-Troponin measurement was performed within 3-hour intervals. Due to the pronounced hs-troponin spike, widespread, ongoing ischemia was suspected, and an immediate invasive strategy was preferred.\n\n【13】An initial 300 mg aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor were given. Inpatient diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG) was carried out via femoral approach , revealing multiple stenoses and ectasis. Driven by high hs-troponin following an atypical presentation of ACS, careful observation of the CAG resulted in recognizing an osteal TO of the obtuse marginal 1 (OM1) branch. A late contrast-filled vessel at the anterolateral region of the myocardiogram  was believed to be a hidden culprit lesion.\n\n【14】Due to the tortuosity, a Hi-Torque Versaturn Abbott Guiding Wire was used unsuccessfully . Next, a GW Fielder XT was used and managed to enter the total lost OM1 branch . Further procedures were routine, with predilatation balloon and implantation of a sirolimus-eluting stent at the proximal LCx to the OM1 branch . An immediate invasive strategy was performed with an established TIMI-3 flow through IRA, and the symptoms were immediately resolved after the procedure .\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】We present a case of patient with migratory discomfort and history of initial self-prescribed drugs, which probably masked unstable angina and clinical presentation. Routine evaluations of ACS were performed, which showed thought to be normal serial ECG, normal echocardiography findings and the spike in high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). Driven solely by the astounding elevation of hs-cTn, CAG was carried out and showed TO of OM1 branch. An immediate invasive strategy was performed with good results.\n\n【17】The presence of TO showed a gap between ECG pattern and spike of the hs-cTn result. The possible reason is due to the LCx occlusion, which is known as the ‘blind area’. Around 30% of patients with LCx occlusion might show a non-diagnostic ECG since the standard 12-leads are not applied facing the inferolateral wall, mainly supplying the basal part of the left ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. There has been a shift in the literature toward finding ECG patterns highly suggestive of TO. Niu _et al_ . were the first to report the presence of the so-called ‘N-wave’ and the involvement of the QRS complex in LCx occlusion. N-waves is defined as (i) a notch or deflection in the terminal QRS complex on the surface ECG; (ii) the height of the notch or deflection of _\\>_ 2 mm; (iii) a continuous change of the notch in 24 hours, even disappearance or transition into the s wave and (iv) prolongation of QRS duration in these leads marks the delayed activation of the ischemic zone. The presence of N-wave in the lead II, III, AVF is associated with 77% sensitivity and 89% specificity of LCx lession, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Right after the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) procedure, a comprehensive re-assessment was made. We realized the decision to perform an immediate invasive strategy was based on vague symptoms, ‘normal ECG’ and spike Delta/changes hs-Troponin with an interval of 3 hours. However, after noticing the inferior leads N-wave , we believe it could have shortened the ischemic time by much faster decision and investigation focusing on the LCx. It is estimated that 27% of NSTEMI patients have an occluded infarct artery, more frequently found in an artery supplying the inferolateral wall. The simple bedside N-wave pattern could be an additional diagnostic tool to unmask the TO, which certainly needs prompt reperfusion (STEMI-Equivalent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|an electrocardiogram showing the so-called ‘N-wave’ in the inferior leads is consistent with left circumflex occlusion (OM1 branch). Noted the presence of N-waves in the initial ECG ( **A** ) and repeated ECG ( **B** ). The presence of N-waves in our cases is consisted of (i) a notch or deflection in the terminal QRS complex on the surface ECG (black arrows in the inferior lead); (ii) the height of the notch or deflection of 3 mm (oval box) and (iii) prolongation of QRS duration in inferior leads (black lines)</u>\n\n【20】The diagnostic work-up in our patient was driven by a surge in hs-troponin since serial ECG and echocardiogram were non-diagnostic for AMI. A re-evaluation of ECG after immediate invasive strategy showed the presence of N-wave and delayed activation of QRS complex, which is consistent with LCx occlusion. We found a pitfall in recognizing this pattern as it hasn’t been listed in recent guidelines. A thorough evaluation of STEMI-equivalent pattern ECG might be helpful for a clinician in determining the revascularization timing.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M.Y.A.

Although diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known complication of diabetes, diabetes mellitus is usually protective of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to DKA is extremely rare; however, cardiogenic shock is a potential complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. We present a rare case describing diabetic ketoacidosis leading to profound acidosis causing stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that is successfully managed with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】The patient is a 25-year-old woman with no prior medical problems who felt weakness and lethargy for 2 days. She was found unresponsive and brought to the hospital. Initial physical exam revealed Kussmaul breathing at a rate of 32 respirations/minute, heart rate of 113 beats per minute and blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg. The patient’s extremities were cool and clammy. Initial glucose was incalculably high. She received 3 liters (L) fluid and started on insulin at 6 units per hour. Initial lab work revealed pH < 7.0 and a bicarbonate of 2 meq. Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with borderline prolonged QTc at 501 ms. BNP elevated at 329 on admission. Initial troponin 0.27 ng/mL, peaking at 4.68 ng/mL.\n\n【4】Shortly after her arrival to ICU, she became hypotensive. The patient’s acidosis was managed aggressively with 8 additional liters of isotonic fluid, a sodium bicarbonate drip, a total of 550 meq of sodium bicarbonate, electrolyte repletion and maintenance on an insulin infusion. Bedside cardiac ultrasound was concerning for an ejection fraction (EF) 20–25% with regional wall motion abnormality, suspicious but typical for stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission confirmed these findings and demonstrated basal and mid anterior wall abnormalities as well as basal and mid-septal abnormalities, consistent with the typical pattern of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . A bubble study was negative for shunts. Cardiology and cardiac surgery were consulted emergently.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic Echocardiography, Hospitalization Day 1. Apical four chamber view. Ejection fraction 25%, multiple wall motion abnormalities. Basal and mid anterior wall abnormalities as well as basal and mid septal abnormalities, consistent with typical pattern of stress induced cardiomyopathy.</u>\n\n【6】The patient continued to be acidotic and persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and bicarbonate repletion, ultimately requiring five different vasopressors and inotropes: including norepinephrine, epinephrine, milrinone, phenylephrine and vasopressin at maximum doses per hospital policies. Patient clinical picture was more consistent with cardiogenic shock at this point. The patient was also developing an acute kidney injury with oliguria despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. She was not a candidate for a mechanical assist device, including Impella, because of her short stature, so the decision was made to initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). TEE was performed at the request of the cardiac surgery team at time of VA-ECMO cannulation. With initial settings of pump speed 3905 revolutions/minute (rpm), blood flow 4.75 liters/min, FiO2 of 100%, Sweep O2 of 2, she was transferred to a tertiary center.\n\n【7】The cardiac transplant team evaluated the patient while she remained on VA-ECMO for 6 days. Right heart catheterisation was performed on hospital day 6 while the patient was maintained on milrinone, revealing central venous pressure 17, pulmonary artery pressure 35/24 通用删除7(英):<u>(27)</u>, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 23, cardiac output 7.4, cardiac index 4, systemic vascular resistance 832, prior to decannulation. A left heart catheterisation revealed no coronary artery disease.\n\n【8】Further work to evaluate potential alternative causes of cardiomyopathy included COVID testing that was negative on admission; additionally, COVID antibodies were negative. Viral titers including Epstein–Barr virus, Coxsackie virus, Human Herpes Virus, Parvovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis panel and HIV were essentially unremarkable. Autoimmune cardiomyopathy was considered, and ANA and ANCA were negative. All four criteria for diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy were met based on the mayo clinic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy  revealed no significant inflammation, granulomas, giant cells or fibrosis. Additional staining with Congo Red excluded amyloid deposition. Additionally, iron staining did not reveal any significant hemosiderosis. The only explanation for this patient’s cardiomyopathy is stress-induced cardiomyopathy, secondary to profound acidemia in DKA. The patient’s hospital course was further complicated by the development of polyglandular failure and polyradiculoneuropathy of bilateral lower extremities, confirmed with EMG testing, ultimately consistent with toxic/inflammatory neuropathy secondary to profound shock and metabolic derangements after extensive imaging and lab studies, including MRI, US, were unrevealing for other attributable causes. A diagnosis of type I diabetes mellitus was confirmed with anti-GAD antibodies. It was felt that her polyglandular failure was strongly related to an autoimmune process related to her type-1 diabetes. The patient received five sessions of IVIG.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Endomyocardial biopsy. Hematoxylin and eosin stain. No significant inflammation, granulomas or giant cells.</u>\n\n【10】Before decannulation, cardiac and renal function improved. The patient was successfully decannulated after 6 days. Her cardiac and renal function eventually fully recovered. Repeat TTE on hospital day 6 demonstrated a recovery of EF to 50% with global hypokinesis . She was transferred out of the cardiac ICU on hospital day 10 and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation unit after a 23-day hospital stay, maintained on daily aspirin, lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Transthoracic echocardiography, hospitalisation day 6.

It has been described more frequently in recent years as a cause of cardiomyopathy, when ischemic cardiomyopathy and all other potential causes are ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is a potentially fatal possible complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy if it is not recognised and managed appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is described in less than 10% of cases related to stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】We present a rare case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that was successfully managed by VA-ECMO in a previous healthy 25-year-old female who was diagnosed with severe DKA.\n\n【15】Various endocrine conditions have been described as precipitating stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Although diabetes has been described as protective against stress-induced cardiomyopathy, the patient’s profound acidosis was significant enough to overcome any protective benefit and lead to cardiogenic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. All other causes of transient cardiomyopathy were ruled out with extensive work during her admission.\n\n【16】The prompt recognition of cardiogenic shock is vital to ensuring favorable outcomes. In our case, cardiogenic shock was identified within the first few hours of presentation, and prompt management and initiation of VA-ECMO led to the patient’s meaningful recovery.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no acknowledgements to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Riley Gurreri, DO.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:02", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:30", "cost": 28.441}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:02"}

Sporadic cases are still reported, particularly among alcoholics and malnourished. Herein we present an unusual case of a previously healthy 15-year-old Caucasian girl, who was recently hospitalized for low velocity spine fractures, back pain and stiffness over several months and rash for 2 years. She was later diagnosed with scurvy and osteoporosis. Dietary modifications were instituted together with supplementary vitamin C, supportive treatment with regular dietician review and physiotherapy. Gradual clinical recovery was seen over the course of therapy. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing scurvy even among low-risk populations to ensure prompt and effective clinical management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Vitamin C not only plays a vital role in the maintenance of oxidation–reduction (redox) balance, tyrosine metabolism and carnitine synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but it also affects the treatment outcome of chronic degenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The deficiency of vitamin C, termed as scurvy, is the manifestation of clinical syndrome from its deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In scurvy, small blood vessels become fragile and easily rupture causing small bleeding areas around the hair follicles, known as perifollicular haemorrhage—a tell-tale sign of a severe vitamin C deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Apart from that, vitamin C deficiency also causes alteration in the structural collagen, contributes to defective osteoid matrix formation and leads to an increase in bone resorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In 80% of cases, scurvy manifestations include musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, haemarthrosis or muscular haematomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Radio-imaging may show osteolysis, loss of joint space, osteopenia or periosteal proliferation, with trabecular and cortical osteoporosis being a common observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Our article aims to describe a challenging case of a young lady who presented with recent low-energy spinal fractures in the presence of long-standing diffuse perifollicular papules and perpetual fatigue.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 15-year-old, otherwise healthy, Caucasian girl was referred to us by our orthopaedic colleague for detailed assessment following a T12 wedge fracture caused by a low impact trampoline injury. There were features of osteoporosis and a significantly reduced Z score on a DEXA scan.\n\n【8】She also complained of progressive fatigue with persistent low back pain and back stiffness for the past 8 months. Thoracolumbar X-ray showed widespread biconcave and plate depression over the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae , with minor loss of T9 vertebral body height and minor depression of the superior endplate of T8.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|(A) Widespread biconcave and plate depression over thoracic and lumbar vertebrae  in comparison with (B) normal thoracolumbar lateral X-ray.</u>\n\n【10】Physical examination noted a slim body habitus with mild kyphosis. Her body mass index was 16.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> at third percentile  with a weight of mere 36.2 kg, well below the fourth percentile for her age and height. In view of the multiple wedge-shaped compression fractures throughout the thoracolumbar region on imaging that were likely to be related to significant insufficiency of the endplate, our orthopaedic team has considered the diagnosis of Scheuermann disease, especially in view of other signs to suggest haematological disorder and no prior history of prolonged steroid therapy. She was then referred to a dietician and was given a review appointment.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Body mass index percentile chart.</u>\n\n【12】However, 5 months later, she was readmitted for lethargy with patches of ecchymoses noted over bilateral knees. Examination also revealed perifollicular purpuric macules over bilateral lower limb and forearms , claimed to be present since the past 2 years with no abrupt worsening.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|The figure shows diffuse perifollicular haemorrhages and hyperkeratotic papules on left forearm extensors.</u>\n\n【14】There were no joint swelling, joint tenderness, palpable masses or lymphadenopathies on peripheral examination. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable. Her blood pressure was normal for her age and height with a normal resting heart rate.\n\n【15】Our first clinical impression at that point was autoimmune disorders or vasculitis. An extensive work-up was performed (including serum electrolytes, trace minerals and thyroid function) with equivocal results. Her renal, liver functions, coagulation profile, Vitamin B12 and folate level were within normal limits, and Vitamin D level and iron studies were within acceptable range. Her immunological screening with rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibody came back negative. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 42 mls/h (N:0–20 mls/h) and C-reactive protein was 6 mg/L ( _N_ < 5 mg/L).\n\n【16】A suspicion for scurvy was only established after a detailed dietary history suggested anorexic behaviour of restrictive type since the age of 10. Vitamin C level was sent and subsequently came back undetectable ( _N_ \\= 26–85 umol/L). Her breakfast typically includes two slices of dry toast and plain pasta, with chocolate rice cakes for lunch and tea. She exceptionally lacks red meat, fish, chicken, green vegetables and fruits in her diet. Otherwise, there was no history of prolonged diarrhoea or vomiting, and no history of gastrointestinal diseases in the family. Coeliac disease screening was also negative.\n\n【17】She was prescribed with oral Vitamin C supplement 500 mg daily, ferrous fumarate 1 capsule twice daily (100 mg elemental iron) and calcium carbonate 10 mmol 6 hourly. A referral for psychiatric assessment and psychological services to rule out psychogenic cause of poor dietary habit was made, and she was also seen by a dietician for proper dietary advice and consultation.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】We presented a rare case of symptomatic scurvy in a Caucasian adolescent. The case posed as a diagnostic challenge as scurvy is exceedingly rare in a first world country. Our patient was initially referred due to concerns of anorexia nervosa or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), therefore routine evaluation of vitamin D and calcium level were sent as part of the standard practice. We only sent for vitamin C level when she developed other associated symptoms.\n\n【20】Scurvy is a clinical cutaneous diagnosis presenting with diffuse perifollicular purpura with corkscrew hair in the presence of low Vitamin C level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is a rare nutritional deficiency and is almost forgotten in developed economies; the disease is commonly associated with malabsorption, malnutrition, alcoholism and old age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The normocytic nonregenerative anaemia associated with scurvy is multifactorial, often coupled with iron, vitamin B9 and B12 deficiencies with evidence of systemic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, our case serves as a reminder to the clinicians to be wary of the disease as it is still being sporadically reported. Its clinical appearance can be dramatic, but the disease is readily and completely reversible with restoration of vitamin C levels.\n\n【21】Hence, scurvy should be considered in an appropriate clinical setting, in patients with bleeding tendencies and cutaneous features, after ruling out other haematological conditions. This case highlights that vitamin C deficiency is still relevant in the modern era and raises the need to educate the primary care provider, who are often the first contact, for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research authorship and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study has been registered with the National Medical Research Register of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR-21-1392-60 859).</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication of the case and photographs used was obtained from the legal guardian.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ku Md Saad and Glackin will act as the guarantor for the paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:23", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:47", "cost": 24.574}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:23"}

Most common cause of esotropia in high myopic elderly is Heavy Eye Syndrome. An uncommon cause in young adults is Acute Acquired Comitant Esotropia often associated with excessive indulgence in near work. A 21 year old male patient presented with diplopia for one year, more for distance than near and spent more than 8-10 hours for near tasks. Unaided visual acuity in BE was 2/60 and was 6/9 in RE and 6/6 in LE with correction. Prism base cover test revealed 25 BO PD for distance and 20 BO PD for near. Diplopia was seen in all position of gaze. Right Eye Lateral rectus resection 8 mm was done and HPE report revealed features of Lateral rectus Muscle atrophy. It is important to understand the pathogenesis of this entity and consider other possible causes of esotropia in myopia. Key words: Myopia, Esotropia, Comitant, Diplopia.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Esotropia in myopia is a rare entity with varied presentation in different age groups. The examination and management of such patients can be very challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most common etiology of progressive esotropia in high myopia in an elderly is the ‘Heavy Eye Syndrome’, which presents with diplopia secondary to progressive esotropia and hypotropia with limitation of abduction and elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Another uncommon form of esotropia in young adults is Acute Acquired Comitant Esotropia (ACCE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Prolonged adduction of the medial rectus muscle due to near-target convergence may cause shortening of the medial rectus muscle and reduced ability to maintain orthotropia at a distance as proposed by Guyton 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This paper reports a similar case of a young adult with high myopia with diplopia.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 21-year-old myopic patient presented with diplopia for 1 year. It was more for distance than during near work. He did ~8–10 hours of near work without using glasses as it reduced his diplopia.\n\n【8】The patient had no history of head trauma, use of systemic medication or systemic illnesses. Ophthalmic examination revealed unaided visual acuity (VA) of 2/60 in both eyes and used −5.75 DS in the right eye (RE), giving VA of 6/36 and −5.75DS/−0.50 DC @180 in the left eye (LE), giving VA of 6/24. Cyclo-refraction revealed wet retinoscopic values of −8.00 DS/−1.50 DC @180 and −7.75 DS/−2.00 DC @180 in RE and LE, respectively.\n\n【9】On orthoptics examination, the Hirschberg test revealed 2 mm (30 diopters) eso-deviation in RE. Extra ocular movement was full. The worth four dot test revealed diplopia for distance and near, with maximum separation of images in levoversion. The Prism Base Cover Test with correction revealed 25 Base Out (BO) Prism Diopter (PD) for distance and 20 BO PD for near ; and without correction, it was 16 BO PD and 8 BO PD for distance and near, respectively. Accommodative convergence to accommodation ratio was 4:1 and was done by the gradient method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The axial length measurement of RE was 26.91 mm and 26.99 mm of LE. His corneal topography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbit were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|RE esotropia without glasses.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|RE esotropia increased with glasses.</u>\n\n【12】He was prescribed glasses after a post-mydriatic test. A prism trial of 6 BO PD in RE and 6 BO PD in LE was started, which removed diplopia for near and decreased for distance.\n\n【13】Definite management was done after 3 months with RE 8 mm lateral rectus (LR) resection. During surgery, thinning of LR muscle was seen, and its histo-pathological examination revealed features of chronic myopathy with primarily collagenous tissue with a single area of scattered muscle fibers and marked endomysial fibrosis, suggestive of LR Muscle atrophy .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Histopathology section using special stain of LR muscle section.</u>\n\n【15】After 1 month, the patient was orthotropic with BCVA 6/6 in both eyes with glasses and no diplopia .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|RE orthotropic 1 week after surgery.</u>\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】AACE is a special subtype of esotropia that is characterized by the acute onset of comitant esotropia with diplopia and is more common in older children and adults. Ocular motility is generally normal without the evidence of paralysis of the extraocular muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. AACE is classified into three clinical types by Lee _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>: (i) Swan-type esotropia that occurs in eyes with fusion disruption, (ii) Burian-Franceschetti type of esotropia characterized by minimal hypermetropia and diplopia, often associated with physical and psychological stress and (iii) Beilschowsky-type esotropia that occurs in adolescents and adults with varying degree of myopia. The mechanism of Beilchowsky-type AACE is thought to be uncorrected myopia with excessive near work, resulting in the inability to maintain the balance between the converging and diverging forces of the eye, and the subsequent development of increased tonus of the medial rectus muscle, leading to esotropia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a study of acquired distance esotropia associated with myopia in young adults by Zheng K _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, 11 adult myopic patients with distance esotropia were studied, who were engaged in near work for an average of 12 hours per day. Among them, seven underwent a pathological examination of their LR muscles, which showed no muscle fibers but rather collagenous fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In another study by Zhu M _et al._ , it was found that ACCE was more common in young adults who performed excessive close visual activities and used digital devices late night 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Since most of our daily activities are performed over smart phones, smartphone use is the majority of ‘near work’. Decreasing near work activities can help decrease the progression of esotropia in myopia in young adults.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I extend my sincere thanks to the patient for trusting me with his treatment.

The TC mostly affects males between the ages 30 to 50 years old at the ventral side of wrist. There are two different forms of TC that have been proposed in previous studies: an idiopathic cause (primary TC) and a joint related diseases cause (secondary TC). Even though trauma has been written to be a common reason for TC, a case of a secondary TC affecting the dorsal wrist following a triquetrum fracture has never been written before. The aim of this report is to present a rare case of a solitary post-traumatic TC at the dorsal wrist following a triquetrum fracture. We describe the clinical presentation, imaging modalities, histopathological and treatment challenges to manage this difficult lesion.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Synovial chondromatosis (SC) is a rare benign lesion of the synovium found in joints and tendon sheaths that undergo metaplasia leading to cartilaginous nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>.

Even though trauma has been written to be a common reason for TC, a case of a secondary TC affecting the dorsal wrist following a triquetrum fracture has never been written before. The aim of this report was to present an unusual case of a solitary post-traumatic TC following a triquetrum fracture.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 62-year-old woman with a past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension and no toxic habits, presented with an 18-month history of progressive pain, swelling and enlarging mass on the dorsum of her dominant right wrist. Patient reported that the mass progressively changed from a soft to a hard consistency during this time, producing a restriction on the range of motion (ROM) at the hand. Two years before our initial visit, she had a non-displaced triquetrum fracture after falling from standing height at her home .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Right ( **A** ) oblique, ( **B** ) anteroposterior and ( **C** ) lateral hand X-rays with a triquetrum fracture (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Right ( **A** ) anteroposterior, ( **B** ) oblique and ( **C** ) lateral hand X-rays before intralesional biopsy.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Right magnetic resonance imaging of the right wrist in ( **A** , **D** ) ‘coronal,’ ( **B** , **E** ) sagittal and ( **C** , **F** ) axial view revealing a dorsal wrist mass.</u>\n\n【9】At evaluation, a non-obese (body mass index = 24) patient with a palpable, soft and non-tender mass on the dorsum area of her right wrist was noted. The right hand had no neurological or vascular compromise. She had swelling and pain in dorsal wrist, with limited ROM of fingers at active and passive extension. Laboratories studies were negative for rheumatologic disease. Radiographs revealed a partially calcified mass in the dorsal aspect of the wrist concerning for a possible osseous or cartilaginous lesion . A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right wrist showed an extensor tenosynovitis and a heterogenous lesion (measuring 2.6 × 1.3 × 2.5 cm) at the level of the first carpal row; suggestive for focal pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), soft tissue chondrosarcoma or TC .\n\n【10】After MRI results, an initial open intralesional biopsy was performed due to the assessment of an indeterminate soft tissue lesion with high probability of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The pathology report from initial biopsy revealed a TC lesion. Upon diagnostic confirmation, patient was oriented on the prognosis and scheduled for an open mass excision. At surgery, patient was blocked with a supraclavicular anesthesia. A dorsal surgical incision was done at the previous initial biopsy site, along with a wide dissection of extensor tendons and extensor tenosynovectomy. The extensor retinaculum was surgically opened and a wrist joint arthrotomy was performed. At further exploration, a 2.2 × 1.3 cm soft tissue tannish trabeculated rubbery mass was excised from the carpus with an extensive curettage . The joint capsule was irrigated, and extensor retinaculum and adjacent tissues were rearranged for wound closure. Patient tolerated procedure without major complications. The pathology specimen was sent to National Institute of Health which revealed similar findings to initial biopsy, confirming a well-differentiated lesion consistent with TC.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Intraoperative view of right dorsal wrist with ( **A** ) mass bed and bony excavation and ( **B** ) extracted calcified mass.</u>\n\n【12】At 1-week postop visit, patient had significant improvement of associated pain symptoms, wounds healed appropriately, and an adequate hand ROM returned. After 2 years of follow-up, patient continues to do well, and no recurrence or metastasis have been observed .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Histopathology of excised mass from ( **A** ) low power to ( **C** ) high power field showing a well-differentiated cartilaginous lesion of a tenosynovial chondromatosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 6**|删除段之间换行|Postop evaluation of intact wrist in ( **A** ) flexion, ( **B** ) extension, ( **C** ) supination and ( **D** ) pronation.</u>\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This report highlights a rare case of TC lesion at the dorsal wrist manifested after a triquetrum fracture. TC is a rare progressive benign tumor from the synovial lining of tendon sheath that mostly affects males between the ages 30 and 50 years old. The TC have been more commonly reported at the dorsal side of hand and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The exact pathogenesis of TC is unknown; however, it has been postulated that tendons undergo an initial neoplastic proliferation of cartilage tissue with hyperplasia in synovial and cartilage nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Two different forms can underly the differences of TC etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The primary TC relates an unknown etiology while the secondary TC involves previous history of osteoarthritis, osteochondral fractures or neuropathic arthropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of a TC is challenging due to the clinical and imaging variability presentation. Clinically, a wrist can present with swelling, pain, finger deformities and reduced ROM caused by compression of nearby structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A wrist X-ray can reveal calcification or ossification of cartilaginous nodules, bone erosion or have normal findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Additional imaging tools, such as MRI, play an excellent role in the location of loose bodies, proliferative synovium and extension of TC lesion prior to surgery. However, TC can be mistaken in MRI for other soft tissue conditions such as periosteal chondroma, PVNS and soft tissue chondrosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. In cases where there is an inconclusive diagnosis made by MRI, a biopsy with histological analysis remains the gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The standard treatment for TC is complete excision of the neoformation and adjacent synovium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Postoperative TC recurrence of the wrist has been reported in 3–23% of cases, requiring additional surgery for excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In cases where there is a high suspicion for a malignant soft tissue tumor of the wrist, an intralesional biopsy can be performed prior to the complete excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our patient, the involvement of loose bodies was not present at initial X-ray and MRIs; and a high suspicion of malignant soft tissue was noticed. Based on the imaging studies and the preference of the principal investigator, an intralesional biopsy was performed prior to an excisional biopsy.\n\n【20】A clinical diagnosis of secondary TC should be suspected in patients with history of prior wrist bone fracture. If clinical and imaging modalities are inconclusive for TC, an initial intralesional biopsy can be performed prior to the complete excision of the mass. After surgery, patients should be monitored regularly for possible recurrence of TC.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thanks to Dr. Edwin Portalatín for reviewing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING INFORMATION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Danny Mangual.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:48:57", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:49:06", "cost": 8.676}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:49:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:48:56"}

The point is to understand’.\n\n【1】Albert Einstein.\n\n【2】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sneakily entered our lives early on in 2020 and the adverse health effects associated with it continue. We now understand more about the virus and about how to manage patients. Large-scale studies have been initiated across the globe and one provided an ally in our fight against COVID-19 in an old fashioned drug, dexamethasone reducing mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Others showed reduction in hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> or simply reinforced the safety of continuing medications during COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We have also realized how catastrophic the virus can be. We learned that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which causes COVID-19, enters the cells using Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. These receptors are found abundantly not only in the pulmonary but also other organ systems such as the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Consequently, extra-pulmonary effects of COVID-19 are not at all surprising. With an increasing number of cases and a forthcoming second wave infection, clinicians must be aware of these multisystem manifestations. In this article, we aim to discuss the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the respiratory and some of the other major organ systems in the human body.\n\n【3】RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\n------------------\n\n【4】The principal manifestation of COVID-19 is in the lungs, where respiratory failure is a leading cause of death. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to the ACE2 receptors, that are highly expressed in the alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), explaining the vulnerability of the respiratory system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_Post mortem_ studies elucidate the observed pathology upon macroscopic and microscopic examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Gross lung findings include patchy to diffuse consolidation, severe interstitial congestion, and thromboembolism while histology demonstrates hyaline membranes, extensive capillary congestion, and microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, consistent with exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) . Whilst aforementioned findings resemble those found in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19-associated ARDS displays a peculiar phenotype owing to dissociation between severity of hypoxaemia and relative maintenance of lung mechanics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|_Post mortem_ examination of COVID-19 patients reveals diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction; microscopic lung findings: ( **A** ) Exudative DAD showing discrete hyaline membranes and prominent capillary congestion; ( **B** ) syncytial cells of pneumocyte II origin; ( **C** ) Extensive capillary congestion without DAD; ( **D** ) Microthrombi in alveolar capillaries; image reproduced from Menter _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> under the terms of the creative commons attribution license</u>\n\n【7】Despite COVID-19-associated ARDS meeting the criteria, it has been proposed that patients developing it could be categorized into type 1 ‘non-ARDS’ and type 2 ‘ARDS’ depending on lung compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Distinction between them can be made based on computed tomography (CT) scans  or, albeit substandard, response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Type 1 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with reasonable lung compliance while type 2 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with poor lung compliance. This has important clinical implications when deciding management in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|In these two patients, following variables were recorded: Type 1 lung weight (1192 g), gas volume (2774 ml), percentage of non-aerated tissue (8.4%), venous admixture (56%), P/F 通用删除7(英):<u>(68)</u> and respiratory system compliance (80 ml/cmH <sub>2 </sub> O); Type 2 lung weight (1441 g), gas volume (1640 ml), percentage of non-aerated tissue (39%), venous admixture (49%), P/F 通用删除7(英):<u>(61)</u> and respiratory system compliance (43 ml/cmH <sub>2 </sub> O).

Myocardial injury, in turn, has been shown to be independently associated with high mortality and various complications such as ARDS and electrolyte disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. There is also rising awareness of acute plaque rupture and consequently, acute coronary events in patients with underlying coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Additionally, the surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines as part of the systemic inflammatory response to COVID-19 can result in myocarditis and other changes including myocardial fibrosis , oedema and pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Interestingly, all these changes were seen in much younger non-hospitalized patients and were associated with adverse events and poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Focal myocardial fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID-19: a 29-year-old male patient (first row) underwent cardiac CMR 1 month after the onset of palpitations.

A study by Puntmann _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> involving 100 COVID-19 recovered patients showed lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to healthy and risk factor-matched controls and significantly raised troponin T levels. After a follow-up of 71 days, 78% of patients had abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance findings. These patients might be in the very early stage of cardiac involvement and perhaps need longer follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> to identify any potential long-term complications, especially in those patients with persistent symptoms attributed to COVID-19.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|**A** and **B** , Histologic findings in an adult man with severe CMR imaging abnormalities 67 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.

ACE2 receptors, found in enterocytes and oesophageal epithelial cells, play an important role in regulating intestinal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> which may, at least in part, explain typical GI symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, which can occur with or without respiratory symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Unsurprisingly, there has been evidence of the virus in faecal samples even after clearance of the virus in the respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, posing questions and challenges for the future.\n\n【17】In addition, a radiology study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> of 412 patients found bowel wall abnormalities in 31% of CT scans and pneumatosis  or portal venous gas in 20% of CT scans in ICU patients. Furthermore, 54% of abdominal ultrasounds, performed mainly for abnormal LFTs, were suggestive of cholestasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, a precursor to liver injury. SARS-CoV2-mediated liver injury can be direct through binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors found in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, or indirect through release of cytokines as a part of the immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This aggravates liver cell damage and bile duct cell dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.

Rashes appeared either before (9%) or after (11%) hospitalization and were described as erythematous, widespread urticarial or resembling chickenpox. Since then skin manifestations have been classified, most comprehensively, in a cross-sectional study of 375 patients with COVID-19 and cutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The five groups identified were (i) pseudo-chilblain lesions, i.e. acral areas of erythema–oedema with some vesicles or pustules 通用删除1(英):<u>(19%)</u>, (ii) other vesicular eruptions 通用删除1(英):<u>(9%)</u>, (iii) urticarial lesions 通用删除1(英):<u>(19%)</u>, (iv) other maculopapules 通用删除1(英):<u>(47%)</u> and (v) livedo or necrosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(6%)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Eruptions occurred before (6%), at the same time (57%), or after (37%) the onset of other symptoms and the type of lesion was associated with age and disease severity, both increasing from Group 1 to Group 5. In this study, patients received a variety of drug treatments and not all skin manifestations may therefore be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. For example, hydroxychloroquine may cause skin reactions including the rare Stevens-Johnson Syndrome presenting with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular eruption that rapidly spreads from distal extremities  to the whole body with orolabial and genital mucosal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.

A systematic review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> of 41 studies found the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 could be divided into three main categories: (i) neurological diseases comorbid with COVID-19, i.e. symptoms prior to the infection and neurological diseases that also act as a risk factor for developing the virus, (ii) non-specific neurological manifestations caused by systemic responses and partly the neuro-invasive behaviour of the virus and (iii) specific neurological symptoms and diseases including encephalitis, myelitis and seizures.\n\n【26】One national registry of 125 COVID-19 patients investigating neurological or psychiatric disease over a three-week period found 31% to have altered mental status including 16 (13%) with encephalopathy  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> and 23 (18%) with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Of the 23 patients, ten had psychosis; six neuro-cognitive dementia-like syndrome and four demonstrated an affective disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Cerebrovascular events were prevalent at 62% (77/125); 46% with ischaemic strokes  and 7% with intracerebral haemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Many patients had known risk factors and were over 60 years old. Predominately we are seeing large vessel disease and markers of a prothrombotic state, suggesting a causal relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. However, the extremely high number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 and the large percentage of those with stroke having other risk factors makes proving causality a challenge. Small asymptomatic infarcts have been identified on magnetic resonance imaging, and blood D-dimer concentrations were raised in many COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The best current explanation for the cerebrovascular events is the hyper-coagulable state SARS-CoV-2 triggers owing to the activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and consequently destabilization of carotid plaque.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 9**|删除段之间换行|Brain imaging in patients with neurological disease associated with COVID-19; ( **A** ) hyperintensity along the wall of inferior horn of right lateral ventricle on diffusion-weighted imaging, indicating ventriculitis; ( **B** ) hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus with slight hippocampal atrophy, consistent with encephalitis; ( **C** ) hyperintensity within the bilateral medial temporal lobes and thalami; ( **D** ) evidence of haemorrhage, indicated by hypointense signal on susceptibility-weighted images, consistent with acute necrotising encephalopathy; ( **E** ) CT showing ischaemic lesions involving the left occipital lobe; ( **F** ) right frontal precentral gyrus of the brain in a man aged 64 years who deteriorated neurologically after admission to hospital with COVID-19 and was diagnosed with acute stroke.

Infections and urinary stasis are implicated as the inciting event for the formation of these entities; however the evidence is limited given the lack of large, epidemiologic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Little is known about the pathophysiology, composition and etiology of these stones.\n\n【5】We describe a case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented with severe post-obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI) due to a giant bladder stone.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and dysuria for 3 days. She reported a history of multiple episodes dysuria that had been treated with unspecified antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past 6 months in Mexico. She had also been suffering from a chronic, pressure-like sensation in the lower abdomen and increased urinary frequency with relief upon lying in a recumbent position. She did not have any gynecological history, including any prior surgical procedures. On physical examination, she was febrile to 101.9°F, tachycardic to 112 beats/min and had a firm, mobile, subumbilical mass with bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed a white blood cells (WBC) count of 13 100 cells/μL with left shift, a serum creatinine of 6.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen of 115 mg/dL. Her urinalysis revealed 676 red blood cells, 929 WBC and positive leukocyte esterase; there was no bacterial growth in the final culture. Non-contrasted computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a large calcified stone measuring 11 × 11 × 10.4 cm  nearly occluding the urinary bladder with bilateral hydroureter and hydronephrosis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography image of the large urinary bladder stone completely filling the urinary bladder.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Three-dimensional reconstruction of the bladder stone.</u>\n\n【10】She was diagnosed with post-renal AKI due to urolithiasis and associated acute, bilateral pyelonephritis. Piperacillin–tazobactam was initiated and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tubes were placed. On Day 3, she underwent open vesicolithotomy and suprapubic tube (SPT) placement with removal of the large, white stone . The stone culture grew one colony of coagulase negative Staphylococcal species, and stone composition was not reported. On postoperative Day 3, she was discharged due to improvement of the kidney function and treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin–clavulanate. After 2 weeks, she was seen in urology clinic where both the Foley catheter and bilateral PCN tubes were removed. SPT was removed 3 months later when her post-void urine quantity was below 50 ml and she was asymptomatic. Given complete recovery, urodynamic studies to assess underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction were not pursued.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Immediate, post-operative gross image of the large urinary bladder calculi.</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Nephrolithiasis is a common problem with increasing incidence and prevalence. One in every 11 people in the USA will report a symptomatic kidney stone by the age of 70 years, with higher prevalence in men than women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, rising rates of obesity have been shown to contribute to the increasing prevalence of these stones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only 5% of these calculi affect the lower urinary tract, the bladder or the urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Urinary bladder stones are usually seen in conditions associated with urinary stasis such as bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder; however spontaneous formations have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Common causes of bladder outlet obstruction include an enlarged prostate, urethral strictures and medication side effects. Pelvic surgeries and genital prolapse, resulting in obstruction, foreign bodies such as Foley catheter, hair and even intravaginal accessories have been implicated as causes for bladder stones in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. In these conditions, the contents of urine such as calcium, oxalate, phosphate and uric acid precipitate forming crystals, which eventually progress to form larger stones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In 15% of cases, the underlying pathology is recurrent UTIs by a urease-forming organism that alters the pH of urine-forming struvite stones. Bladder stones are often associated with renal and ureteral stones; however they can occur alone. Bladder stones are rare in females accounting for only 5% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Post-renal AKI is caused by calculi in most patients. Other potential etiologies are benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic or pelvic neoplasms or retroperitoneal fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Stones causing AKI are usually bilateral in the kidneys, ureter or urethra. It is rare for bladder stones to become large enough to cause bilateral hydronephrosis, hydroureter and AKI but was seen in our patient where her stone was large enough to limit the flow of urine resulting in kidney injury. Management of these giant bladder stones is vesicolithotomy, as supported by prior case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】This particular case is unique in that our patient had no discernable risk factors for the formation of a bladder stone. While she reported a history of recurrent UTIs, it is unclear whether these symptoms occurred prior to the formation of the bladder stone or if the stone resulted in urinary frequency with findings of pyuria and microscopic hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Lack of a complete past medical history pertaining to infections, antibiotic use and the limitations to health care access in the patient’s home country of Mexico makes the diagnosis of underlying etiology challenging.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】To our knowledge, there are only a few cases of giant bladder stones presenting with complications of kidney injury. Due to the relative rarity of giant bladder stones, there is not enough data on the incidence, management and long-term follow-up on this entity; however, an early diagnosis and surgical management are needed to prevent permanent kidney injury, ensure appropriate evaluation for underlying risk factors, as well as optimize surveillance for recurring stones.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no financial disclosure or competing interests and approved this submission.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Although no patient identities were used, the patient provided her informed consent.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rohit Agrawal, MD.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:15", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:52", "cost": 36.747}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:15"}

Looking at reports on the metastasis across a joint, there have been a few reports on a hip joint. Here, we report a case that acetabular osteosarcoma progressed to the femoral head through the ligament of the femoral head (round ligament). We obtained written informed consent by the patient.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】Case: a 63-year-old male was presented with pain in the left proximal thigh.

Tumor cells were fusiform or round shaped with atypical nuclei, often binucleated and scattered mitotic figures, suggesting high-grade sarcoma . After preoperative chemotherapy was started, a deterioration of renal function was observed, and therefore, the chemotherapy (cisplatin + doxorubicin) was stopped after one course.

The articular cartilage was not destructed by the tumor, neither on the acetabular side nor on the femoral head side. There was no tumor extending into the joint cavity . Final diagnosis was chondroblastic osteosarcoma with slight osteoid formation and little therapeutic effect . Histological findings were similar to the preoperative biopsied specimen. Microscopic examination confirmed the unique extension of tumor cells on the gross findings. The tumor invaded along to the ligament from the acetabular site to the femoral head .

As of 3 years after surgery, neither local recurrence nor metastasis has been observed.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】There have been few reports on progression of the extremity bone tumor across a joint. Simon has reported on the three mechanisms of progression into a joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. First, the tumor may directly invade and cross the articular cartilage. Second, sarcomas may extend around the articular cartilage, beneath the joint capsule, and into the joint. Finally, intra-articular penetration can occur by direct extension of the tumor through or around an osseous–tendinous junction of an intra-articular ligament, usually the cruciate ligaments. In addition, Simon proved progression through cruciate ligament histologically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Since then, progression of osteosarcoma of the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and sacroiliac joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u> have been reported occasionally.\n\n【21】Simon has reported that capillary vessels extending from the femur are distributed in cruciate ligaments and tumors progress through the ligament tissue directly. However, in the case of femoral head, it has been proved that the bloodstream distributes in round ligament disappeared at 6 months old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, and there has been no report on the progression of tumors in detail.\n\n【22】As for reports on progression of acetabular osteosarcoma extending to the femur, there have been only few reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. These reports were cases with no precise imaging findings and pathological findings. There were no reports showing whether or not the tumor had progressed through the round ligament. In our case, MRI revealed little accumulation of joint fluid and the structure of ligament components was maintained, which means that the tumor did not progress into the joint cavity, but progressed to the femoral head surrounding the ligament without destruction of the ligament . Gross observation of the resected specimen revealed that the tumor did not disseminate in the joint cavity . On the other hand, looking at the tissue specimen, the tumor cell in contact with the normal ligament reached the femoral head side, and the cell was considered to progress through some kind of structure adjacent to the ligament . Considering the findings of MRI and resected specimen and tissue specimen, in this case, we considered that the tumor cell did not disseminate in the joint cavity, but progressed between ligament and synovial tissue covering the ligament .\n\n【23】Since synovial fold existed on the surface of normal round ligament, there was a high possibility that the tumor progressed between ligament tissue and synovial fold. In addition, the synovial fold was considered to prevent the tumor from expanding into the joint cavity to some extent. Unlike cruciate ligament, blood vessels in the round ligament in adults had disappeared, and therefore, the tumor might have progressed through microvascular of the synovium between ligament and synovial fold covering the ligament, and not passing through the inside of the ligament.\n\n【24】Based on the findings stated above, this case suggested that the tumor might progress through the synovium around the ligament of femoral head in the cases of osteosarcoma arising from the proximal femur and acetabulum, even if accumulation of joint fluid or invasion to ligament is not obvious by imaging. Therefore, in acetabular osteosarcoma cases, we considered that it would be important to take into account the existence of the tumor progression when planning surgical margins.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has given written consent for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Seiichi Matsumoto, MD, PhD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:45:47", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:38", "cost": 51.182}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:45:46"}

On his way for bronchoscopy, he developed seizures and was found to have three brain lesions. The aspirate from brain biopsy grew _S. intermedius_ whereas the aspirate from mediastinum showed only acute inflammation. Follow up imaging after antibiotic treatment showed interval resolution of brain abscesses and the mediastinal mass. We believe that the patient had aspiration pneumonia from _S. intermedius_ which then metastasized to mediastinum and brain.

Along with _Streptococcus constellatus_ and _Streptococcus anginosus_ , it constitutes the _S. anginosus_ group, previously known as _Streptococcus milleri_ . _Streptococcus intermedius_ is known to cause pneumonia, endocarditis and abscesses in the liver, lung and brain in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Based upon severity, the infection may require medical as well as surgical management. We discuss a rare presentation and clinical course of _S. intermedius_ infection in a young man who developed mediastinal mass and brain abscesses secondary to its dissemination.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 22-year-old male from Ohio River valley in USA was referred for the evaluation of a newly detected mediastinal mass. His medical history was significant for three episodes of pneumonia treated with antibiotics in the last 1 year. His social history included cannabis abuse and binge drinking till loss of consciousness. Recent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest performed at outside hospital revealed a new 3.5–4.5 cm conglomerate nodal mass in the mediastinum compressing the main stem bronchi . For the further evaluation of the mass, an endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was planned for the next day.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|CT chest with 3.5 × 4.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> conglomerate nodal mass in the mediastinum compressing the main stem bronchi (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n【7】En route for EBUS-TBNA, he developed witnessed generalized tonic clonic seizures and was brought to the emergency department. On arrival, he was alert and oriented but complained of right upper extremity numbness and tingling. Physical examination revealed right facial droop, right pronator drift and brisk reflexes on the right side. Laboratory data showed elevated white blood cell count of 15 000/μL and elevated platelet count of 640 000/L. Emergent CT brain revealed supra-tentorial lesions in the fronto-parietal area, right thalamus, and posterior right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain confirmed the findings and better delineated the lesions .

The cultures from the EBUS-TBNA were negative for bacterial and fungal infections. The following day, he underwent stereotactic right temporal lobe biopsy with aspiration of purulent material diagnosing an abscess. He had subsequent aspiration of the other two brain abscesses. Brain biopsy showed focal acute and chronic inflammation with mild gliosis. The purulent aspirate from the brain lesions grew _S. intermedius_ . Based on the microbiological sensitivities the antibiotic regimen was consolidated to intravenous ceftriaxone and later to meropenem due to development of rash with the former drug. Transthoracic echocardiography was negative for endovascular infection. Dental examination was also unrevealing. He was discharged on intravenous meropenem to complete 6 weeks of therapy.\n\n【10】Upon completion of intravenous antibiotics at 6 weeks, CT chest showed near-total resolution of the conglomerate mediastinal nodal mass . He also experienced significant improvement in his neurological deficits. Follow-up MRI brain revealed interval reduction in the size of the abscesses and no mass effect. He was placed on oral amoxicillin–clavulanate for 4 more weeks. At 3-month follow up he had full resolution of symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|complete resolution of the mediastinal nodal mass on the follow-up chest CT at 6 weeks.</u>\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】_Streptococcus intermedius_ has been implicated in a variety of purulent infections and abscesses with predilection towards brain and liver. The production of intermedilysin, a human specific cytolysin by _S. intermedius_ is considered as the virulent factor in producing abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Giuliano _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> showed that all the disseminated cases of _S. intermedius_ had multiple brain abscesses.\n\n【14】Our patient had history of cannabis and alcohol abuse. He had recurrent pneumonia most likely from aspiration during his binge drinking. The development of lung and brain abscesses from _S. intermedius_ in a young patient with substance abuse has been previously reported by Traube _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We believe that _S. intermedius_ , a part of oral flora, was aspirated during these episodes and led to pneumonia. The bacteria then spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes causing mediastinitis and finally a conglomerate mediastinal mass. The infection hematogenously spread to the brain causing multiple abscesses leading to seizures. Till now, there is only one reported case of mediastinal abscess from _S. intermedius_ . It was caused by direct contamination of the lymph nodes with the oral flora during EBUS-TBNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To best of our knowledge, this is the first ever reported case of _S. intermedius_ infection presenting as a mediastinal mass due to mediastinitis secondary to recurrent pneumonia.\n\n【15】A diagnosis of _S. intermedius_ infection requires isolation of the organism from the fluid or tissue cultures. All the involved sites should be accessed until the organism is identified. In our patient, the cultures from brain aspirate grew _S. intermedius_ whereas the cultures from EBUS-TBNA were negative. Given the clinical improvement and radiological disappearance of the mediastinal mass with antibiotic treatment, we believe that the mediastinal mass was also caused by _S. intermedius_ .\n\n【16】Our aim is to make fellow physicians aware of _S. intermedius_ infection as a differential for mediastinal mass in a patient who is at risk for aspiration, or has history of recurrent pneumonia, or has multiple brain lesions. In the appropriate clinical setting, _S. intermedius_ can translocate from the oral cavity to the lungs and can further metastasize to the mediastinum and the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. If there are lesions involving multiple organs, an effort should be made to isolate the organism from the involved body sites and fluid cavities to confirm the etiology. In cases with documented or recurrent _S. intermedius_ infection, solitary mediastinal mass can be followed for resolution with appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent provided by the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Shahistha Hameed.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:51:01", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:51:14", "cost": 12.434}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:51:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:51:01"}

Non-cutaneous abnormalities (dental, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurological, ophthalmic, pulmonary and skeletal) have also been reported. Bone marrow failure (BMF) is the main cause of early mortality, with an additional predisposition to malignancy. DC results from an anomalous progressive shortening of telomeres resulting in DNA replication problems inducing replicative senescence. Men are more affected than women are and X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disease are recognized. There are no targeted therapies for DC. Patients treated with androgens had a hematological response. We herein describe case of a 32-year-old man, presented with several characteristic systemic features of this condition, including the classic triad of lesions, dysplastic bone marrow, epiphora and liver cirrhosis with grade I esophageal varices.

We report a case of 32-year-old patient with DC in our department of clinical hematology at Tishreen University Hospital, in an attempt to increase awareness about this rare disease.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 32-year-old male, without significant past medical history, he was admitted in the department of clinical hematology for a diagnostic workup for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. At admission, patient appeared pale but vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed nail dystrophy , leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue , Hyperkeratotic and pigmented patches were present on the back, neck, trunk and palms . Patient did not have a history of tobacco usage. The onset of the cutaneous lesions was at 7 years of age with slow and progressive accentuation. Patient mentioned presence of similar case in his family (brother, uncle {maternal side}). Mental retardation was not observed. Admission labs included WBC: 2.200 cells/ul, Absolute neutrophil count: 1.500 cells/ul, hemoglobin 8 g/dl, platelet: 65 000/ul, creatinine: 1 mg/dl, ALT: 13 U/L, international normalization ratio (INR):1.9. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done and showed normocellularity with trilineage dysplastic changes, dysplastic changes in RBC lineage were characteristic . According to these findings, the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was confirmed. Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen revealed, coarsened hepatic echotexture, moderate splenomegaly 15.5 cm and an important dilation of the splenic veins at the splenic hilum and the portal veins. Therefore, portal hypertension was suspected due to hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis. The patient was referred for gastrointestinal consultation then prepared for high-digestive endoscopy, which revealed, grade I esophageal varices. Unfortunately, percutaneous liver biopsy was contraindicated due to tendency to bleed because of thrombocytopenia and prolonged INR. Therefore, prophylactic propranolol was initiated. Viral marker for hepatitis B or C that could cause pancytopenia showed no specific viral infection. The patient did not present with respiratory complaint, chest X-ray indicated hilar enlargement after which CT of the chest showed no abnormality. Epiphora was mentioned and punctual atresia was suspected but the patient refused to be referred for ophthalmologic consultation. The patient in this study presented all the components of the triad, in addition to bone marrow dysplasia, hepatic cirrhosis and ophthalmologic manifestation. We started the treatment with danazol a synthetic androgen derivative also known as 17α-ethinyl testosterone. Three-week later a good hematologic response was observed, WBC: 5500 cells/ul, Absolute neutrophil count: 3000 cells/ul, Hgb: 9 g/dl and Plt: 95 000/ul. The patient currently undergoing outpatient treatment at the hematology and gastroenterology outpatient clinics.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Nail dystrophy ( **a** , **b** ); Leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue ( **c** ); Abnormal skin pigmentation of back area ( **d** ).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Dysplastic features of erythroid linage.</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】DC is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence of one case in one million, with multiple and variable clinical manifestations, the classic and initial form are usually characterized by the mucocutaneous triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy and leukoplakia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with DC have been shown to have disease diversity in terms of age at onset, symptoms and severity. Even if the patients have the same gene mutation, the manifestations of the disease are variable, which is why sometimes it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Nail changes are characterized by thin, dystrophic nails that may be markedly shortened and fragile with a subungual thickening, the dystrophy usually appears in the first decade of life and begins as longitudinal ridging and splitting. With the progression of the disease, it eventually leads to pterygium formation with the distal expansion of the hyponychium and obliteration of the distal groove 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Skin findings can be variable, ranging from tan-to-gray macular or patchy areas of hyper or hypopigmentation with a reticulated or mottled pattern. Atrophy and telangiectasia can also be present (poikiloderma), DC is also frequently associated with oral findings, which include oral leukoplakia, increased dental caries, hypodontia, thin enamel structure, aggressive periodontitis, intraoral brown pigmentation, tooth loss, taurodontism and blunted roots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The patient described in this paper showed reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin with onset in the seventh year of life, nail dystrophy on the toes and leukokeratosis plaques on the tongue—that is, the three components of the classic triad. The BM findings in DC are variable and range from normal to different severity of aplasia depending on the stage of the disease. Sometimes it is indistinguishable from aplastic anemia due to other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The BM abnormalities can progress in different forms with the appearance of myelo-dysplasia in one or more lineages or leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our 32-year-old patient, the initial labs revealed pancytopenia. Then, MDS was confirmed according to bone marrow aspiration and biopsy findings. Hepatic complications have been described, too. Some studies reported that loss-of-function telomerase gene variants are risk factors for sporadic cirrhosis. However, there is not a definitive conclusion that can explain the appearance of hepatic complications in DC. The possible hepatic complications can show diverse histological liver features such as necrosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation and hyperplasia, although hepatic lesions are not a frequent complication in DC (~7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, US of the abdomen suggested portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Then, high-digestive endoscopy confirmed the presence of grade I esophageal varices. Therefore, prophylactic propranolol was started. Pulmonary fibrosis characterized by loss of lung epithelium, prominent fibrosis and impaired gas exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In addition, abnormalities of pulmonary vasculature are seen in ~80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had no pulmonary manifestation. The clinical diagnosis of DC is based on the presence of the four major features of the disease, which include the mucocutaneous triad and bone marrow failure, as well as the presence of multisystem features of the disease: epiphora, developmental delay or mental retardation, pulmonary disease, periodontal disease, esophageal stricture, premature hair graying or loss, hyperhidrosis or development of malignant lesions. To make a correct clinical diagnosis of DC requires at least two of four major features and at least two multisystem features, and sometimes it is difficult because of the disease heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient had the mucocutaneous triad, in additional to MDS, hepatic involvement and ophthalmic manifestation. There is no effective and curative treatment for DC. It is now apparent that androgens can elicit a hematologic response in a substantial proportion of patients with specific inherited BMF syndromes, namely Fanconi anemia and DC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient began taking danazol and 3 weeks later a good hematologic response was detected. We experienced a patient who was diagnosed as DC with MDS. DC is being now studied ever more intensively and this case report can be beneficial not only to the health care professional but to those suffering from this rare disease.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from the patient to participate in the study.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent to publish this information was obtained from patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:59:05", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:59:30", "cost": 24.914}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:59:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:59:05"}

We conclude by suggesting that earlier valve replacement may result in better outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) is 3.6 per 100 000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Though IE originates as a valvular dysfunction, it is essentially a multisystemic disease for three reasons. Firstly, valvular dysfunction can cause cardiac failure which, in turn, precipitates renal failure causing circulatory compromise. Secondly, valvular dysfunction can cause embolic complications and their associated problems. Finally, patients are also at risk of mortality from the severe sepsis that occurs in IE, which can cause multi-organ failure in itself. Therefore, it is unsurprising that such patients have a high mortality, which is made even worse in the context of a superimposed COVID-19 pneumonia as described in this report.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In November 2020, a 74-year-old man with no co-morbidities presented to the emergency department of his local hospital with a 3-day history of diarrhoea and vomiting. On examination, he was agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12/15 (E4, V3 and M5). He had a pansystolic murmur that was heard loudest at the apex, which radiated to the left axilla. He had a number of physical signs suggestive of IE, which are shown in Figs 1 and 2 . He also had evidence of impaired oral hygiene, which is shown in Fig. 3 . His inflammatory markers were elevated. His peripheral blood cultures were taken, and he was started on intravenous ceftriaxone immediately afterwards. His blood culture grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ . A routine SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab taken on admission was negative). Consequently, the patient satisfied two major criteria (new valvular regurgitation and the presence of vegetations) as well as three minor criteria (multiple Osler nodes, a Janeway lesion and a single positive blood culture) of the modified Duke’s criteria for IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hence, definite IE was confirmed.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Image **A** shows the presence of a Janeway lesion and a nail bed haemorrhage on the third digit of the left hand; image **B** also shows the presence of an Osler node on the first digit of the left hand.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Osler node on the fifth digit of the right hand.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Amalgam restoration in the upper first molar on the right side with absent upper first premolar and molar on the left side.</u>\n\n【9】Figure 4 shows the trend in his white cell count and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over Days 1–9. During this time, his GCS ranged between 11/15 (E4, V2 and M5) and 15/15. An abdominal ultrasound on Day 5 showed no evidence of renal obstruction, hence, his renal failure was attributed to worsening sepsis. By Day 8, he had become anuric and he was treated with haemodialysis on Days 8 and 9.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Trend in white cell count (x10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and eGFR (ml/min/1.73m <sup>2 </sup> ) over Days 1–9.</u>\n\n【11】On Day 10, he was transferred to a tertiary hospital for mitral valve replacement. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous venovenous haemofiltration. However, a routine admission nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on Day 11 was positive, thus delaying his surgery. We believe this infection may have occurred either during transit or during the final few days of the patient’s admission at his local hospital. On admission to the tertiary hospital, he underwent serial nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 at twice weekly intervals. A plan was made to operate as soon as he tested negative, or as soon as we could be satisfied that his COVID-19 pneumonia incubation period had elapsed.\n\n【12】However, on Day 24, he developed nausea and vomiting. Computerised Tomography (CT) imaging of his chest showed peripheral ground glass change with bilateral pleural effusions in keeping with COVID-19 pneumonia . He was started on supplementary oxygen, oral dexamethasone and intravenous remdesivir. This was in accordance with local guidelines for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time. He initially maintained an oxygen saturation >92% without the need for invasive ventilation. However, he died on Day 31 from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 5**|删除段之间换行|Images **A** and **B** are axial CT views showing patchy consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions; image **C** is a coronal CT view showing patchy consolidation; these features are in keeping with acute COVID-19 pneumonia.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】We identified four other case reports of IE complicated by COVID-19 pneumonia from Italy, Indonesia, Brazil and Morocco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. A common theme identified from these cases was a delay in surgical valve replacement. A fatal outcome was observed in two cases, including the index patient and the patient from Brazil. An international study of 1128 patients found that 49.6% of patients who underwent an emergency operation after SARS-CoV-2 infection developed post-operative pulmonary complications such as ARDS within 30 days of their operation. In this group, the 30-day mortality rate was 39.6%. The authors also reported that male sex and age of greater than 70 years were poor prognosticators, both of which were present in the index patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Moreover, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to independently increase the risk of ARDS. It postulated that the mixing of blood with non-endothelial surfaces during cardiopulmonary bypass increases the production of tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 10, both of which are cytokines implicated in the development of ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Despite these compelling reasons to delay the surgery, our final decision to delay was weighed carefully against the argument that delaying the surgery would have exposed him to an increased duration of IE-related disease. Nonetheless, on balance, we still felt that our decision to delay was appropriate. On reflection, this case demonstrates how challenging it can be to decide on the optimal timing of surgery in such patients.\n\n【16】Another common theme between our case and others was the prevalence of _Staphylococcus aureus_ . The index patient as well as the patients from Brazil and Italy had _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteraemia with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. _Staphylococcus aureus_ has been reported to be present in the saliva of 21% of patients with oral disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and the oral cavity was the most likely reservoir for infection in this patient. Its combination with a SARS-CoV-2 co-infection confers significant morbidity and mortality. A case series of 42 patients found that mortalities at 14 and 30 days in patients who had _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteraemia with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 co-infection were 54.8 and 66.7%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】This case sheds light on whether it is justified to offer surgical valve replacement to IE patients who are SARS-CoV-2-positive and within the incubation period for COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite the compelling reasons to delay the surgery, we conclude by suggesting that earlier surgical valve replacement, before the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, could result in better outcomes in carefully selected patients.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Shaun Robinson (consultant clinical scientist) for providing and formatting the echocardiography video files.

We treated a patient with a partial-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon by a series of four type I porcine collagen ultrasound-guided injections, at weekly intervals. At the same time the patient underwent physical therapy, consisting of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises. The patient was assessed before the treatment and up to 18 months after the last injection by the Constant–Murley score, the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and ultrasonography. Shoulder pain and functional limitation progressively improved and they almost completely disappeared at the last follow-up. Ultrasonography showed a gradual healing of the partial-thickness tear and a regeneration of the tendon structure. This is the first study on ultrasound-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Future research should confirm the excellent result achieved in this case report.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Partial-thickness rotator cuff tear (PTRCT) is one of the most common shoulder injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The supraspinatus (SSP) tendon is the most affected in PTRCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The treatment of PTRCTs remains disputed; non-operative treatment is the first approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Many injectable therapies have been proposed in the last years with controversial effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. According to literature, this is the first study on ultrasound (US)-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of PTRCTs.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In March 2018, a 55-year-old right-handed housewife came to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Practice complaining of pain and functional limitation in the left shoulder, lasting 2 months. She didn’t report neither systemic or genetic disorders, nor previous traumas or surgical interventions and nor allergies or intolerances. She suffered from hypothyroidism and she was in treatment with sodium levothyroxine. She didn’t smoke. She was habitually practising free-body gymnastics twice a week. She had already treated the shoulder pain with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, without improvements.\n\n【6】Based on physical examination we suspected left SSP tendon involvement. We excluded glenohumeral osteoarthritis by X-rays. Shoulder ultrasonography, performed by a radiologist with >20 years of experience in skeletal muscle US, revealed a partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the SSP tendon (Grade II according to Ellman classification). We decided to treat the patient with a series of four US-guided intratendineous injections of 2-ml porcine type I collagen at weekly intervals in combination with physical therapy. After a full and clear description of the study, the patient was invited to sign the informed consent.\n\n【7】Injections were performed by a single doctor with >10 years of experience using an anterior approach. The patient was seated on a chair with the arm in internal rotation in order to expose as much of the SSP tendon as possible. This position was best achieved by placing the patient’s arm behind her back. A 22-gauge needle was directed towards the tear of the SSP tendon as guided by US until the tip of the needle was seen in the correct position and then the collagen was injected slowly.\n\n【8】Physiokinesitherapy was performed starting from the first injection and during 4 weeks, three times a week, 30 minutes per session and consisted of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises, with the aim to recover range of motion and strength of the shoulder.\n\n【9】The patient was evaluated at the time of enrolment (T0), right before the third injection (T1), and 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after the last injection by means of the Constant–Murley (CM) score and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Clinical data are reported in Table 1 and their trends illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Outcome measures of the CM score and the DASH questionnaire over the time.</u>\n\n【17】US assessment was performed at T0, T3 and T4 by the same expert radiologist. As shown in Fig. 2 , longitudinal US of the SSP tendon at T0 showed a well-defined hypoechoic area, indicating partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the tendon, without retraction (Grade II according to Ellman classification). Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (Grade I according to Ellman classification). Eventually, the T4 US assessment no longer showed tear within the tendon, which in addition appeared quite regular and isoechoic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|US assessment of the SSP tendon across multiple follow-up intervals.

No adverse events have been described after collagen injections.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】According to literature, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of shoulder US on rotator cuff tear detection has a range of 46–95% and 50–95%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The variability is highly correlated with the level of experience of the operator and the patterns of the rotator cuff tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Non-operative treatment is the first approach to PTRCTs, and surgical option has to be considered when the conservative treatment has not effect within the first 6–12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical therapy is the first-line treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rest from exacerbating activity, especially repetitive overhead activity and heavy lifting, can improve the pain component. Cortisone injections may be helpful in alleviating pain in conjunction with physical therapy but offer only short-term effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Different injectable therapies have been proposed in the past years for the treatment of PRTCTs (e.g. hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, prolotherapy), but they have achieved controversial effectiveness according to literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】We have decided to treat the PTRCT of our patient with type I collagen injections on the base of (i) the positive effect proved by injectable collagen on the tendon structure of cultured tenocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; (ii) the good results achieved by collagen patches implanted arthroscopically in the treatment of large and massive RC tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and (iii) the promising outcomes of collagen injections in the treatment of epicondylitis and SSP tendinopathy without tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Studies of degenerative tendons have found a small but significant decrease in the total collagen content and an increased proportion of collagen type III relative to collagen type I. The increase in the collagen type III to collagen type I ratio was consistent with smaller, less organized and weaker tendons.\n\n【25】This case report has one main limitation: the patient was not previously treated with other injective therapies; so, we cannot state that the positive effect on the PTRCT is certainly due to type I porcine collagen only. It is well known indeed that tendon needling is able to disrupt the chronic degenerative process of tendinopathies favouring localized bleeding and fibroblastic proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, no data exist on the benefits of tendon needling as a stand-alone treatment for tendon tears.\n\n【26】In conclusion, the tear healing, the improvement in the tendon structure, the clinical and functional positive outcomes and the absence of side effects allow us to propose collagen injections as a valid option for the treatment of PTRCTs. A regenerative effect of collagen injections on tendon structure may be assumed to account the results achieved.

Despite both being a common entity, care should be taken in determining the approach of management. Vesicoureteric reflux commonly presents with symptoms of urinary tract infection. Nonetheless, one must bear in mind that vesicoureteric reflux may also present at a later stage with its associated sequelae, including hypertension. Hypertension in a paediatric age-group has a vast list of aetiologies. Clinical history and physical examination are pivotal in narrowing down the potential diagnosis, thus allowing for appropriate investigations to be carried out. Correct diagnosis is critical as misdiagnosis not only subject patients to unnecessary investigations but possible harmful treatment being put forward. Early diagnosis also allows for appropriate treatment to be initiated, thus preventing complications from occurring.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 8-year-old boy, previously healthy, presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of double vision and right eye squint with giddiness for 1 month. He denied any history of recent head trauma, fever or headache. On the initial presentation, blood pressure was 186/124 mmHg with a pulse rate of 83 per minute and afebrile. On examination, there was limited right eye movement on the lateral gaze. The rest of the physical examinations were normal. Computed tomography of the brain was normal. Intravenous and oral antihypertensive medications were initiated to control blood pressure. Blood investigations were normal. Special blood investigations that include antinuclear antibody, antistreptolysin O titer, C3, C4, random cortisol, aldosterone and renin level were also normal. Renal ultrasound  showed a small right kidney with multiple cystic areas and an enlarged lobulated left kidney. Given suspicion for renal mass causing the hypertensive emergency episode, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was performed. MRI  revealed a large well-circumscribed lobulated heterogeneous mass at the lower pole of the left kidney with dysplastic right kidney.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Renal ultrasound showed dysplastic right kidney (A) with lobulated enlarged left kidney (B).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|MRI of the abdomen in T2 weighted sequence in coronal view showing dysplastic right kidney with lobulated enlarged left kidney ( <sup>* </sup> ).</u>\n\n【8】Considering suspicious MRI findings of left renal mass, a paediatric radiologist was consulted for a second opinion. Micturating cystourethrography  was then performed, which revealed right grade 5 vesicoureteric reflux, left upper pole grade 3 vesicoureteric reflux and left lower pole compensatory hypertrophy. Re-evaluation of the MRI images concludes findings of severely hydronephrotic and atrophied right kidney, atrophied upper pole and hypertrophied lower pole of the left kidney. Cystic areas in the right kidney correspond to severe hydronephrosis, while the enlarged lobulated left kidney represents hypertrophied left lower pole. At this stage, overall features were suggestive of chronic vesicoureteric reflux with bilateral reflux nephropathy. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan  carried out later has confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Micturating cystourethrography in the micturating phase showed grade 5 reflux noted into the right renal pelvicalyceal system.

There are numerous aetiologies accountable including hyperthyroidism, mineralocorticoid excess from congenital adrenal hyperplasia and aldosterone secreting tumours, pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, renal parenchymal disease, primary hypertension and rheumatologic disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. For children with confirmed hypertension, the initial investigation would aim to exclude any underlying renal disease. As part of paediatric hypertension work out, renal sonography has been recommended for all paediatric patients with essential hypertension to diagnose parenchymal and renovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Other aetiologies such as Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma and rarely pheochromocytoma are childhood tumours associated with hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In this case study, both the renal ultrasound and abdominal MRI findings revealed enlarged lobulated left kidney, suspicious for a renal mass which could be the cause for hypertension. However, micturating cystourethrography demonstrated otherwise. The overall conclusion drawn from different modalities of ultrasonography, MRI and fluoroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral vesicoureteric reflux with reflux nephropathy.\n\n【14】Initial suspicion of renal mass in this case is in line with the clinical presentation, given that renal tumours are not uncommon in children, however majority paediatric renal tumour cases are diagnosed before the age of 5 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Renal tumours account for nearly 6–7% of paediatric malignancy and about 90% of them are Wilms tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most frequently observed symptoms of nephroblastoma include abdominal mass, abdominal pain, hematuria, fever and hypertension, with treatment includes nephron-sparing surgery or radical nephrectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Vesicoureteric reflux is defined as the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract. Increasing use of antenatal ultrasound allows vesicoureteric reflux to be detected during maternal screening and those not detected with antenatal hydronephrosis often diagnosed later as part of urinary tract infection workup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this case study, contrary to the common presenting symptoms, there was no history of urinary tract infection symptoms. Instead, the initial presentation was due to raised blood pressure.\n\n【16】A review article has described that the ideal radiological approach in cases with urinary tract infection, vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring may be varied depending on either a conventional bottom-up approach or the top-down approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The bottom-up approach focuses on the detection of upper and lower urinary tract abnormalities, while the top-down approach focuses on identifying the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis before proceeding with other investigations. However, it is controversial regarding which approach is better at evaluating the ultimate risk of renal scarring. The primary goal for early diagnosis, appropriate management and follow-up of vesicoureteric reflux and febrile urinary tract infection is to prevent renal scarring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Similar to this case study, two of the possible outcomes of vesicoureteric reflux i.e. reflux nephropathy and hypertension were already present when the patient became symptomatic requiring hospital admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. As in this case, compensatory hypertrophy lower pole of the left kidney is believed to be a consequence of renal scarring due to reflux nephropathy.\n\n【17】Even though most patients with vesicoureteric reflux initially presented with urinary tract infection symptoms, they may also present as a sequela including hypertension. Clinical history and physical examination are pivotal in narrowing down the potential diagnosis, thus allowing for appropriate investigations to be carried out. Appropriate investigations will ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment to be instituted for the patient.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muhamad Zabidi Ahmad is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:02:24", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:02:38", "cost": 13.999}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:02:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:02:24"}

Early detection of such lesions can prevent complications by linking patients to care early. We report a case of a 45-year-old Chinese men who has sex with men (MSM) presenting with a wound on his penis after masturbation. Initial impressions of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation led to a circumcision and frenulectomy. Routine histology done provided an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates suggestive of Syphilis. Serology was done to confirm the diagnosis and patient was treated with oral doxycycline for 2 weeks. This case aims to highlight the importance of routine histology during circumcisions especially because lesions such as syphilitic chancres are not always typical in presentation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Syphilis is an infection caused by the _Treponema pallidum_ spirochete and has a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. A syphilitic infection is classically thought to evolve through 4 basic stages—Primary, Secondary, Latent and Tertiary with additional qualifiers of Early and Late depending on the duration of the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While this system provides a framework for understanding the natural history of a syphilitic infection, the key challenge in diagnosing based on such a system is that clinical signs can be subtle and are often mistaken as other less sinister ailments. The traditional teaching of a painless ulcer with a clean base for example tends to be an exception than the rule with many primary syphilitic lesions having many different and atypical presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This is the main reason that it is known as the ‘Great Mimicker’ and has gone undetected despite advances in screening methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, because many of the signs in a Primary and Secondary Syphilis resolve spontaneously, patients seldom attend follow-up clinic sessions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Underpinning the importance of early detection of Syphilis is that left untreated, Syphilis progresses into 3 major life-threatening syndromes—Late Neurosyphilis. Cardiovascular Syphilis and Late Benign gummas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Certain populations such as the MSM are known to have a higher prevalence of Syphilis compared with the heterosexual population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Circumcision is the process of partially or completely removing the foreskin and is one of the most common surgical procedures for men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Indications for circumcision include religious/cultural purposes, phimosis, balanoposthitis and risk reduction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There is much debate about the utility of routine histology of the excised prepuce in circumcisions for medical indications and the extent to which such an investigation changes the overall management.\n\n【5】We report the clinical findings of a patient presenting with wound at the frenulum of the penis noticed immediately after masturbation, which was more in keeping with a traumatic wound, based on the patients’ history, that was eventually confirmed to be a Primary Syphilis infection.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 45-year-old Chinese man presented to the clinic with a wound at the ventral surface of the penis. Patient reported that he noticed the wound after he masturbated a few days ago. He reported that he felt a sudden pain as he was masturbating and noticed a wound around the frenulum. Patient also complained of pain around the wound especially during erections.\n\n【8】Patient has an allergy to Penicillin but no previous medical history or family history of autoimmune diseases. No history of tobacco smoking or alcohol use. Patient is a Men who has Sex with Men (MSM) and engages in predominantly penetrative anal sex. Patient reports that sexual intercourse is usually protected and has 3–5 sexual partners that year. Partners are usually casual, and patient does not know the HIV or Syphilis status of any of his partners. His last Syphilis and HIV test was done 6 months ago and was non-Reactive. Last sexual intercourse was 3 months ago.\n\n【9】Physical examination found a partial thickness tear at the ventral aspect of the penis, midline and extending 5 mm along the longitudinal aspect of the frenulum. Wound was shallow with regular borders. Base of the lesion was yellow with minimal discharge and no surrounding erythema. No inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other lesions were seen in the groin.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|(A) Initial presentation of ulcer; (B) histology of resected foreskin demonstrating presence of plasma cells.</u>\n\n【11】Initial impression was that of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation. Patient was offered a frenulectomy to remove the remaining frenulum. Patient opted for a circumcision at the same time as he already had an elective circumcision planned for a few months’ time.\n\n【12】Circumcision was done on the same day of the visit under local anaesthesia. A dorsal slit method was used to remove the foreskin; the remnant frenulum tissue was removed in the same incision. The circumferential wound was closed with 3–0 Vicryl, while the wound at the frenulum was left to heal by secondary intention. Excised tissue including the foreskin and the remnant tissue surrounding the frenulum was sent for histology.\n\n【13】Histology found that the tissue from the remnant tissue of the frenulum to be extensively ulcerated. The ulcer contained a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells with polymorphs towards the surface and a dense underlying mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate including a large number of plasma cells strongly suggestive of a Syphilitic infection.\n\n【14】Syphilis tests were done according to current laboratory protocols. Syphilis serology yielded a Positive Treponemal Test (Syphilis Treponemal Antibody) and Positive for both Non-Treponemal Tests—Rapid Plasmin Reagin (RPR) Titre 1:2 and _T. Pallidum_ Particle Agglutination (TPPA).\n\n【15】Given the previous negative Syphilis blood test 6 months ago, a new positive Treponemal and Non-Treponemal blood test result and a wound with plasma cell infiltrates seen on histology, the diagnosis of primary syphilis was made.\n\n【16】Patient was commenced on 2 weeks of doxycycline due to his allergy to penicillin. The patient’s wound healing was uneventful with no secondary infections and completely healed at the end of 2 weeks. A repeat blood test was done 1 month after which demonstrated a decrease in the titre levels of the RPR tests. Follow-up bloods after 6 months demonstrated a Non-Reactive RPR with the Treponemal Antibody and TPPA remaining reactive. The diagnosis was that of Primary Syphilis status post-completed treatment with serological scarring.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】We present a case of a man who presented with a wound along the frenulum that occurred after masturbation. Originally thought to be a mechanical frenulum tear from overzealous masturbation, patient elected for a circumcision with a frenulectomy. Routine histology revealed an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates. The patient’s sexual orientation of an MSM, placed him at a higher risk of contracting Syphilis, prompting further testing in the form of Syphilis serology that eventually led to the conclusion that the initial frenulum tear was in fact a primary syphilitic chancre. We hope that this case would highlight the importance of routine histology in circumcision in guiding the diagnostic process.\n\n【19】Currently, there is an ongoing debate on the utility of routine histology for circumcision. Previous studies have compared using clinical signs or histology to diagnose dermatological lesions on the foreskin in patients undergoing circumcision but have yet to come to a consensus on which modality is superior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Most recently, Kerr _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> report that clinical diagnosis of lesions in the prepuce correspond to histological diagnosis in up to 80% of cases. Coupled with the lack of evidence associating dermatological lesions of the foreskin with the development of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, these authors are of the opinion that routine histology testing is not required and that clinicians can reliably achieve a diagnosis solely with a physical examination of the area. Additional findings in the study also suggest significant costs saving with the same patient outcome when foregoing a histological investigation.\n\n【21】In a response to these claims, Bunker _et al._ raises an important perspective that a diagnosis need not purely be a clinical or histological diagnosis but a combination of the two. The authors highlighted important shortcomings of the initial study by Kerr _et al._ such as the lack of a uniform control group when making the comparisons between the accuracy of a clinical and histological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Indeed, it is further reported by Bunker _et al._ that their centre’s experience up to 45% of the diagnosis of Penile intraepithelial neoplasia was achieved only with a histology with only 8% of the clinicians being confident of the diagnosis without histological confirmation.\n\n【22】From the standpoint of using histology as part of the diagnostic work up instead of solely relying on clinical examination, we agree with that routine histology should be done for circumcision. Syphilis is a prime example of the need for clinical assessment and laboratory investigations to complement each other to provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【23】Syphilis is a disease caused by the _T. Pallidum_ bacteria and is known as the Great Mimicker as early symptoms can be vague and misdiagnosis based on clinical signs is very common. Primary syphilis is the earliest phase of the infection and is defined by the presence of a painless chancre which usually resolves spontaneously. The situation is similar in secondary Syphilis where a prominent but painless rash erupts and disappears without any intervention. The transient and seemingly indolent nature of the physical manifestations of the initial stages of a Syphilis infection mean that the diagnosis cannot be achieved solely on a physical examination but also requires laboratory investigations. Wound swabs for general bacterial cultures are unable to detect syphilis because the treponemal bacterium does not grow well in regular culture mediums. Although is possible to detect the presence of _T. Pallium_ in wounds with dark field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing or polymerase chain reaction, these investigations tend to be labour intensive and not commonly done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Histology of tissue can identify plasma cell infiltrates which is a result of the inflammatory response elicited by the infection and is common in a Primary Syphilitic infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In the current case, the lesion that the patient presented with was painful and its appearance coincided with a traumatic event (masturbation). The differential diagnoses considered when approaching this case included, trauma, herpes and Syphilis. Although Syphilis was one of the differentials in this case, the lesion reportedly manifested shortly after a traumatic incident of overzealous masturbation and the presence of pain (Syphilitic chancres classically described as being painless) directed us towards considering the wound more traumatic in nature. While there is evidence to suggest that certain at-risk populations such as the MSM group have a higher prevalence of Syphilis, this patient’s sexual orientation was of secondary consideration, and we would like to highlight the process of achieving the diagnosis which was made possible because of routine histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Without the additional information about the presence of plasma cell infiltrates in the excised tissue provided by routine histology, the diagnosis of Syphilis would have otherwise gone untreated. The early diagnosis and prompt treatment of primary Syphilis in this patient allowed for an early intervention in reducing his risk of developing a more severe form of the disease. This would not have been possible without a combined diagnostic approach of using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation.\n\n【25】Presentations of Syphilis are seldom straightforward; however, the consequences of a missed diagnosis and delay in treatment can allow the disease to progress to Tertiary Syphilis which can be life threatening. We hope that in reviewing this case, we can call to mind the fact that Syphilis chancres are never typical in presentation and the importance of routinely incorporating investigations such as histology in circumcisions to complement clinical assessment.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed equally to the writing and preparation of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The Authors have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained for this Case Report.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL DECLARATION\n-------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval and consent has been approved by our center’s (Dr Tan Medical Center—Singapore) internal review board.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent for publication has been obtained by the patient discussed in this Care Report.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials—no data set used in this Case Report.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:55:32", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:55:38", "cost": 6.492}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:55:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:55:30"}

Skin lesions mainly occur on the lower extremities. Sheets of immunoblasts and centroblasts are characteristic findings at histologic examination. This case report highlights diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for primary cutaneous B-Cell lymphoma-leg type.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas-leg type (PCBCL-L) usually present in elderly female patients, and with a pathophysiology poorly understood its possible origin is most likely multifactorial involving genes from chronic antigen stimulation from viral or bacterial infections. Diagnosis is mainly determined by skin biopsy that shows diffuse distribution of atypical lymphoid cells showing positivity for markers of CD20+, CD79a+ and negative for CD5 and CD3. It also presents with frequent cutaneous relapses and compared to other cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, that usually have >90–95% survival rate, PCBCL-leg type has a <60% of 5-year survival rate.\n\n【4】This lesions can easily be mistakenly as chronic skin wound infections and many times misleads its diagnosis and treatment, which is why we present the case of young male with a history of chronic leg wound that was treated first as an infection and then finally by obtaining a skin biopsy the final diagnosis of PCBCL-L lymphoma was made. He was started on standard chemotherapy regimen with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Patient presented initial excellent response but he relapsed shortly afterwards. He is currently on salvage chemotherapy with a different regimen consisting of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE) with close monitoring.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】We present the case of a 45-year-old male with past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 9 years on highly active antiretroviral therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension, who presented to the emergency room (ER) with ongoing right lower extremity pain for the last 4 months. At initial work-up, his HIV viral load was undetectable, and his CD4 count was 800 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> (600–1200 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). Four days before hospital admission, the patient noticed new ulcerations on his right lower extremity , associated with increased swelling and subjective febrile episodes. Initially, he was diagnosed with cellulitis, warranting surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy with doxycycline. His condition was stable on discharge, however, his symptoms worsened, and he was readmitted after 12 days.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Right lower extremity chronic wound, overlying scaling and raised erythematous wound was noted.</u>\n\n【8】A thorough physical examination also revealed a new scaling and raised erythematous indurated lesions on his left lower extremity. Antibiotic therapy did not provide any significant improvement in either of both extensive skin lesions. Therefore, he underwent a second wound debridement and a tissue sample for biopsy was obtained. Culture of the tissue grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_ . Skin biopsy showed histological findings consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Bone marrow involvement was ruled out. He was diagnosed with PCBCL-L per pathology report, which showed atypical lymphoid cells in subcutaneous regions with appearance of immunoblasts positive for CD20 and CD79a, consistent with B-cell origin. The patient was discharged for outpatient oncologic evaluation. His right lower extremity, however, became progressively more swollen, painful and with worsening ulcerations and he was readmitted.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Large and round with centrally located nucleoli (immunoblasts) seen in skin lesion biopsy (hematoxylin–eosin).</u>\n\n【10】During his second hospital admission, computed tomography (CT) of the right lower extremity revealed images concerning for myositis. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, meropenem and clindamycin. Surgery and interventional radiology were consulted; they recommended against acute surgical intervention. Before initiation of chemotherapy by the oncology service, he underwent cancer staging with CT of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Fortunately, no findings of lymphadenopathy, lymphoma or metastatic spread to adjacent or distant organs were noticed. Lumbar puncture confirmed no central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and prophylactic methotrexate was administered intrathecally due to the disease’s high risk of CNS involvement. Positron emission tomography/CT scan showed extensive and diffuse subcutaneous indurations with associated hypermetabolic activity involving the right lower extremity, supporting the absence of any neoplastic extension. He started chemotherapy as inpatient with a regimen consisting of a combination of R-CHOP. He tolerated well the regimen without developing significant side effects, and within the next few months, his skin wound decreased in size along with symptomatic improvement. Approximately 3–4 weeks later, CT scans showed there was near complete interval resolution of tissue edema, decreased caliber of reactive right inguinal and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes and no new lymphadenopathy. Due to the patient’s good clinical baseline performance and age, the decision by the oncology team was to pursue treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate for 5 cycles with excellent response initially, but after his fifth cycle, patient was found to have significant progression of cutaneous lesions. During his most recent hospital admission, he started a salvage treatment with R-ICE and the medical care team will continue to monitor response.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Primary cutaneous lymphomas are categorized as non-Hodgkin lymphomas involving exclusively the skin. Their incidence is 10 cases per million habitants per year. The vast majority of cutaneous lymphomas originate from T-cells, but 20–30% are attributed to B-cell neoplasms. Primary cutaneous lymphomas are classified based on their histological origin. It has been described that they can arise from the marginal zone, the follicle center of the B-cells, or from large B-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Differential diagnosis can include indolent skin lymphomas that include primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) and primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The marginal zone B-cell type is considered as one of the extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Its median age of presentation is 50–54 years and even up to 90 years, occurring more often in men than women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) is considered to be the most indolent type, due to an excellent prognosis, patient median age of presentation of 50 years and higher frequency of appearance in head or neck (60%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both primary cutaneous marginal zone and follicle center lymphomas are considered to have minimal risk of extracutaneous spread, making them less likely to be aggressive compared to PCBCL-L.\n\n【14】The PCBCL can be divided by the affected zone; the most studied one is limited to the lower extremities, known as a PCBCL-leg type (PCBCL-L). This subtype is very aggressive and involves a monotonous proliferation of centroblasts. These lymphomas usually affect elderly women and present with rapidly growing tumors in one or both lower extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Its pathophysiology is still not well understood. Viral or bacterial infections seem to be predisposing factors. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients with HIV, have been associated with the development of this subtype of tumors, but proper studies that demonstrate this relationship are still lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient suffered of HIV for 9 years, raising suspicion for this to be a very likely predisposing factor.\n\n【16】The cutaneous pattern is usually characterized by nodular, and sharply demarcated wounds. The neoplasm is mostly allocated to the dermis, where usually neoplastic B-cells can resemble normal B-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The PCBCL-L has a tendency to relapse, in those cases, it tends to affect other zones of the body. Location in the lower extremities and existence of multiple lesions are poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Markers from immunohistochemistry of the skin biopsy are CD20, CD19 antigen, BCL2  and BCL6. The PCBCL-L has an increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, such as mutations in p14 and p16, key genes that once mutated can result in the destabilization of the p53 protein, resulting in cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Neoplastic B-cells strongly express BCL-2 on inmunohistochemistry.</u>\n\n【18】Treatment should be selected based on the type of lymphoma and its stage. These regimens are based on retrospective studies from case series or case reports. Valid randomized control trials are inexistent. Chemotherapy is indicated in PCBCL-L, and prior case reports showed good response with R-CHOP, but relapses are frequent, and treatment may not be curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】Neoplasm of the skin should be suspected in HIV patients with chronic skin wounds that are not responsive to antibiotics or other interventions. Timely diagnosis can help change the management plan drastically. PCBCL-L respond rapidly to chemotherapy with R-CHOP regimen but relapses are common.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no relevant acknowledgment.

The literature shows increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects. We present a 57-year-old woman with stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma who received treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. She had disease progression on maintenance immunotherapy, confirming resistance. Palliative radiation to the sternal bone lesion resulted in a significant response to all areas of cancer, confirming the abscopal effect. Unfortunately, she developed severe pneumonitis; to our knowledge, this is the first case of abscopal lung toxicity.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The word abscopal was first used by Mole in 1953, meaning ‘at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The abscopal effect describes tumor responses outside the irradiated field, a rare phenomenon. A recent literature review of the abscopal effect between 1969 and 2014 detected only 46 cases, even though millions of patients are being treated worldwide with radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Local radiation plays a wide range of roles in cancer treatment and helps reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery, curative treatment and palliation of symptoms. Ionizing radiation (IR) causes DNA damage by several mechanisms, such as producing reactive oxygen species and DNA double-stranded breaks. The latter is the principal mechanism by which IR induces DNA damage. There is evidence of increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects, and several prospective studies are trying to study this phenomenon.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old female with a 37-pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department complaining of right-sided abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous liver with numerous nodules concerning metastatic disease. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 1.8 cm spiculated left upper lobe lung nodule, several lytic bone lesions and extensive hepatic metastatic disease .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computerized tomography showing left lung spiculated nodule and multiple liver metastatic lesions.</u>\n\n【7】A biopsy of the liver lesion showed nests and clusters of polygonal-shaped tumor cells with irregular nuclei and copious amounts of finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase stains revealed positive cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1. Tumor cells were negative for p40 and hep par-1 stains, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from lung primary. Laboratory data showed elevated liver enzymes and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Next-generation sequencing of the tumor revealed no actionable mutation, PD-L1 ˂1% with a tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 97th percentile. She started carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab with monthly denosumab injections. After four treatment cycles restaging scan showed a treatment response, and she continued maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months on maintenance therapy, the CEA started trending up, and she noticed worsening fatigue and sternal pain. Pemetrexed was discontinued to help with fatigue. A PET-CT scan showed significant progression with left upper lobe primary carcinoma, an extensive hepatic metastatic disease with most liver parenchyma replaced by tumor and progressive bone metastasis, including a large lesion in her sternal bone . She started palliative radiation for the sternal lesion and received 2500 cGy in five fractions while continuing pembrolizumab. Clinically she noticed significant resolution of sternal pain and fatigue and decided against changing systemic therapy. A total of 8 weeks after radiation, a bone scan revealed reduced activity in the sternum. However, a PET-CT scan surprisingly showed significant improvement in liver lesions  and a corresponding improvement in CEA. One month later, she was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and severe hypoxia, with CT showing evidence of pneumonitis . Grade 2 immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis was suspected, and immunotherapy was held. She received a tapering systemic corticosteroid regimen, steadily improving her symptoms. Immunotherapy was rechallenged per guideline-directed management (American Society of clinical oncology—Management of Immunotherapy Toxicity 2021). Unfortunately, rechallenging resulted in recurrent pneumonitis; hence, we discontinued treatment permanently. At her last follow-up, she appeared clinically well 6 months after stopping immunotherapy. A PET-CT showed no fluorodeoxyglucose activity in the liver, lungs and bones.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Positron emission tomography **(A)** Showing diffuse liver metastasis, lung nodule and a sternal bone metastatic lesion confirming disease progression. **(B)** Eight weeks of radiation therapy showing resolution of activity in the liver, lung nodule and sternal bone lesion.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Computerized tomography showing areas of consolidation bilaterally consistent with pneumonitis.</u>\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】The natural anticancer response is partly mediated by dendritic cells presenting new antigens to T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cancer cells evade the body’s immune response by impairing T-cell activity and dendritic-cell mediated stimulation of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1). T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors that overcome this include anti-programmed cell death protein 1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 monoclonal antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, commonly termed immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has been particularly promising in patients with high PD-L1 scores and higher tumor mutational burden 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had a high TMB, and she had an expected initial response to pembrolizumab. One of the crucial factors for the abscopal effect is the presence of infiltrating T cells; the higher presence has a positive association with the impact. Radiation therapy is well known to induce DNA damage which is believed to be responsible for triggering the immune system but is also a central mechanism for initiating the abscopal effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The damaged cells release neo-antigens that prime and activate the cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, which migrate and infiltrate the metastases outside the irradiated field, resulting in tumor regression.\n\n【12】A study of lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab showed improved survival when they had a history of previous radiation compared to patients who did not receive radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The PACIFIC trial evaluating consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients showed better survival outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy without significantly increasing immune-related side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In contrast, a study of patients with NSCLC treated with concurrent immunotherapy (durvalumab–tremelimumab) and radiation showed no significant difference in patients receiving different doses of radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Note that the patients in this study were pretreated with immunotherapy, and these findings raise doubts about radiation as a modality to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Despite contrary observations, our patient had an excellent abscopal response after palliative radiation and likely overcame immunotherapy resistance. Similar observations have been noted in multiple case studies. A unique feature of our case is diffuse pneumonitis that we firmly believe is an abscopal toxicity from systemic immune activation after radiation outside the lung. We described this unique phenomenon of distant effect as ‘abscopal toxicity’ (toxicity in the organ not exposed to irradiation field) since this finding is novel and has not been described in the literature. Our patient tolerated immunotherapy well without any side effects until she received radiation. Another critical factor is that our patient received palliative dose radiation to the sternum and never received radiation to the lung fields. We did not identify any case of abscopal pneumonitis in our literature search.\n\n【13】Regarding other abscopal toxicities, we found one other case reported in a patient exhibiting bullous pemphigoid after receiving palliative radiation while on treatment with nivolumab for renal cell cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We believe it is essential to be aware of abscopal toxicity as some of these toxicities can appear at a distant site and result in significant morbidity. Immunotherapy resistance is an area that needs timely research as many patients stop responding after some time. Although case studies like ours suggest radiation could overcome the resistance, there is a need for an accurate biomarker to identify patients who will benefit from this.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data is available on request to the corresponding author.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Aswanth Reddy, MD (Corresponding author).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:23", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:56:20", "cost": 237.187}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:56:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:23"}

These CIC and TTS conundrums will occupy us all increasingly in the time to come.\n\n【1】Cases in point are the two reports that have been recently published in the _Journal_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The first case by Malley and Watson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> described a 73-year-old woman who suffered TTS on the final day of her 7-day course of chemotherapy with lomustine, cytarabine, cyclophosphomide and etoposide, which she had received for a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The authors appropriately noted that in such cases of chemotherapy-induced TTS, the ‘causality remains to be established and the mechanism of action is not yet fully understood’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The authors refer to the rarity of TTS in patients receiving anthracyclines (contrary to the rather frequent occurrence of CIC) with the more frequent occurrence of TTS with 5-FU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and the association of cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide with CIC, and cytarabine and cyclophosphamide with TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In the absence of specific guidelines to inform a decision about the choice of further chemotherapy (rechallenge with a different drug) in patients who had suffered TTS, avoidance of known cardiotoxic agents appears advisable, and employment of a drug like busulfan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> may be a good choice.\n\n【2】The second case was reported by Abdulrahman _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> on a 41-year-old woman with metastatic esophageal cancer who suffered TTS on Cycle 1, Day 3 of FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy, after disconnection of the infusion pump (‘it is of interest that symptoms occurred following pump disconnection, and that previous doses had been well tolerated’), with symptoms resolving over 2 days, and a return to normal of her transiently compromised left ventricular function (LVF) within 2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The seemingly offending drug (5-FU) was replaced by another fluoropyrimidine agent (capecitabine), commencing in 3 weeks after Cycle 1, without untoward incident, as also noted in a previous report. It is conceivable that the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin is implicated herein, considering the intensified cardiotoxicity when these two agents are administered together 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Also, the third ingredient of FOLFOX (i.e. oxaliplatin) has been linked to TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The authors make a distinction between CIC and TTS resulting by chemotherapeutic agents, refer to CIC recurring in about half of those rechallenged with 5-FU, and provide examples from the literature of many cases of 5-FU associating with CIC or TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】There are many things we do not know and need to delineate in these _perceived_ associations among cancer, chemotherapy and TTS (and this also applies to CIC): (i) The physical stresses of procedures and surgeries, and the internal turmoil of having cancer, often nor apparent or verbalized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, may be at the roots of TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. (ii) The increased sympathetic tone and catecholamine release promoted by cancer and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> have not been explored. (iii) Using β-blockers in patients with cancer and/or undergoing chemotherapy has not been systematically considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. (iv) The fuzzy boundaries between CIC and chemotherapy-triggered TTS need exploration. Although the clinical course in TTS is more short-lived in comparison with CIC, this is not always the case since there are cases of CIC with rapid recovery and incidences of TTS with marked delays in the restoration of the LVF to the baseline. (v) It is conceivable that if we start being proactive in checking for rise of catecholamines and cardiac biomarkers and implementing echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, we may find that atypical or milder cases of TTS are more frequent than currently thought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u> in patients with cancer and those receiving chemotherapy. (vi) For patients with cancer and/or receiving chemotherapy, cardiac complaints communicated to their physicians can be further characterized using a patient-operated, ‘smart-phone’-based technology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> in their ambient ambulatory environment. All the above will teach us a lot about cancer, chemotherapy, CIC and TTS, which we do not currently comprehend.\n\n【4】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【5】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:47:54", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:48:38", "cost": 43.442}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:48:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:47:54"}

They usually arise in the gonads, and only 1–3 % of them arise in the mediastinum. We present a case of simultaneous multiple organs immature teratomas who was admitted to Razi hospital because of cough, dyspnea, and left-side supraclavicular mass. Computed tomography (CT) showed a big mass with multiple high densities, nodular, semi-solid, heterogenic structures on the left side of the neck, left-side anterior mediastinum, right-side middle mediastinum and right-side suprarenal region. CT-guided needle biopsy was performed and histopathological study showed immature teratoma. After performing neoadjuvant therapy, the tumors were removed. The patient underwent chemo radiation therapy on the mediastinum and abdomen. On 6-months follow-up, he was asymptomatic.

They usually arise in the gonads. Only 1–3 % of all germ cell tumors arise in the mediastinum and they are account for 15 % of adult anterior mediastinal masses. They are equally presented in men and women between the ages of 1 and 70 years, the average age is 28-years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.

We found only three cases of extra gonadal multiple organs immature teratomas- in ovary with mediastinum, liver with mediastinum, and in different parts of brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 – 7 \\]</u>. We report an extremely rare case of 26-year-old man with cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, neck mass and harboring synchronous immature teratomas in his left side of neck, left-side anterior mediastinum, right middle mediastinum and abdomen.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 26-year-old man admitted to Razi hospital with cough, dyspnea and left-side neck mass . Physical examination revealed a multi lobulated, firm mobile and non-tender mass in the left side of neck. Physical examination of other organs was normal. Chest X-ray showed a mass in anterior and right middle mediastinum. Ultrasound of abdomen showed a large nonhomogeneous mass measuring approximately 20 cm × 18 cm × 8 cm seen in the right upper quadrant and extending to the sub hepatic region. Biochemical testes were normal. AFP (Alfa Feto Protein), CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) and B-HCG (Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) values were normal. Computerized tomography (CT) of neck, chest and abdomen revealed a multiple lobulated mass in left side of neck, a well encapsulated solid mass lesion 12 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm in the left anterior mediastinum and another mass in the right middle mediastinum in the right sub-carina region and a mass in the right side of abdomen. All masses lesions were heterogeneous with predominant fat density and no signs of chest wall or pericardial invasion or focal calcification . Ultrasounds of testis, pelvic and inguinal regions were normal. Core needle biopsy of the neck, left mediastinum and abdomen masses was done by CT guided. Diagnosis was immature teratoma. Oncology consultation was performed and neoadjuvant therapy had been done with Etoposide, Ifsofamid and Cisplatin according to their recommendations. Twenty days after neoadjuvant therapy, neck dissection was done and all masses were removed completely . Histopathological examination of three lesions showed immature cystic teratomas . After four weeks—with median laparotomy—a large sub hepatic mass which extending from liver up to right kidney, adherent to aorta, kidney and inferior vena cava, was excised with small residue on the aorta and inferior vena cava. Histopathological examination of mass showed an immature teratoma . Patient underwent chemo radiation therapy on the mediastinum and abdomen.

They are commonly classified benign or mature and frankly malignant or immature. This classification is on the basis of the presence of neuroectodermal elements within the tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Malignant teratomas usually have more immature elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Only 5% of all teratomas occur in the head and neck region, predominantly in the cervical region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. Cervical teratomas are almost always benign and congenital in children, but they may be locally aggressive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Abdominal and pelvic immature teratomas are very rare in adults. Immature abdominopelvic extra gonadal teratomas are rare and most frequently occur in middle-aged females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. They usually occur in the presacral space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, but can also arise in the ischiorectal space and perineum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. Our case was a 26-year-old man who had immature teratomas which were not congenital. Teratomas can present with respiratory distress. In these cases, immediate excision is required and surgery is curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In presented case, total excision neck and mediastinum masses were performed . Teratomas in the thoracic cavity usually occur in the anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. In an analysis of 142 cases of teratomas in childhood, all the 14 mediastinal teratomas were in the anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.

Usually in benign teratomas, AFP and B-HCG are normal and elevated levels may be indicative of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. In our case, these markers were in normal ranges. CT usually reveals complex appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging can differentiate teratoma from others mediastinal cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Radiological differential diagnoses of teratoma are lymphangioma, venous malformations with phleboliths, dermoid, neurenteric cysts, tornwaldt cyst and basal meningocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Mature teratomas are removed by simple cystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>.

We describe a case of a healthy male with no prior cardiovascular risk factors who developed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism following a diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. The patient made a significant recovery following coronary thromboaspiration and anticoagulation therapy. Multiple mechanisms including an indirect hyperinflammatory immune response and/or direct endothelial damage may explain the prothrombotic state related to COVID-19. The cytokine storm leads to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent thromboembolism. Awareness of the lethal cardio-pulmonary sequalae of COVID-19 is important as surges continue across the world owing to new variants.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first described in December 2019, in Wuhan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The outbreak which started locally in China has spread rapidly across the globe, drawing the attention of cardiologists worldwide because of its association with cardiovascular diseases. The exact mechanism of cardiovascular involvement is not clearly understood but those with underlying cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors including male sex, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity are predisposed to COVID-19 and are at a greater risk of developing adverse cardiovascular outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We herein present a case of a 54-year-old man with no underlying cardiovascular risks who developed ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism (PE) following a diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonitis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 54-year-old gentleman of African origin with no underlying medical health issues presented to the hospital due to worsening shortness of breath and productive cough over 5 days. His respiratory symptoms were associated with persistent chills, rigors and generalized myalgia. On arrival, his arterial blood gas showed type 1 respiratory failure requiring 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO <sub>2 </sub> ) to maintain saturations. He was tachypnoeic (respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min), tachycardic (heart rate of 115 beats/min) and pyrexic at 38.2°C. His blood pressure was 112/54 mmHg after 1 L bolus of intravenous fluids.\n\n【6】Clinical examination revealed the patient visibly breathless with increased respiratory effort and bilateral coarse inspiratory crackles throughout both lung fields. His chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral patchy airspace opacification , but the admission electrocardiography (ECG) was unremarkable. Blood tests revealed a significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 415 mg/L (normal range 0–5) and Troponin-T was normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Pulmonary disease in COVID-19.

He was then commenced on Dexamethasone 6 mg, prophylactic enoxaparin (4000 IU daily) and transferred to the designated COVID ward for further care. On the fourth day of admission, he unexpectedly developed pleuritic chest pains and worsening breathlessness with an increase in FiO <sub>2 </sub> of 50%. D-Dimer was mildly elevated at 0.73 μg Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU)/ml (0–0.5) which warranted a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). The CT scan showed no evidence of PE but there was extensive subpleural and peribronchovascular ground-glass infiltrates throughout the lungs which were typical features of COVID-19 pneumonitis .\n\n【9】The patient appeared to be on course for recovery until Day 8 of admission when he suddenly developed central crushing chest pains which woke him from sleep at 7 a.m. ECG revealed marked ST-segment elevations in leads v1–v5, consistent with an acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) . Troponin-T was markedly raised at 750 ng/L (range 0–14) and 6 h later increased to 8432 ng/L. He was loaded with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and was urgently transferred to the catheterization laboratory.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Electrogram showing ST-segment elevations in leads v1–v5 with evolving ST-segment changes in leads I and aVL.</u>\n\n【11】Coronary angiogram revealed a single-vessel, total mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion . All other vessels were normal. With support using an EBU 4 guide catheter, the acute lesion was successfully crossed using a 0.014×190 cm Sion Blue wire . The mid-LAD was carefully dilated with a 3.5×20 mm NC Trek balloon and eventually after multiple attempts, there was minimal flow into the LAD with multiple filling defects, suggestive of acute thrombus formation . An aspiration catheter was used to extract large amounts of red thrombus . Despite repeated balloon dilatations, flow in the distal LAD remained poor. The _glycoprotein IIb_ / _IIIa_ inhibitor, eptifibatide and a bolus dose of unfractionated heparin (5000 IU) were given.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Coronary angiogram showing an acute occlusion of the mid left LAD.

Spontaneous echo contrast was also noted in the left ventricular cavity. At this point, the patient was mobilizing on the wards while on prophylactic enoxaparin (4000 IU daily) and DAPT. Four days later, he started experiencing pleuritic chest pains in the context of a markedly raised D-Dimer of 4.24 μg FEU/ml (0–0.5). This time, CTPA confirmed a PE  and Rivaroxaban 20 mg was commenced alongside Clopidogrel 75 mg and Aspirin 75 mg daily. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors and hypercoagulability was negative, but ferritin, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase and CRP levels were markedly raised, suggesting a hyperinflammatory state. The patient’s overall clinical condition gradually improved and was discharged after 18 days of hospitalization with follow-up in the COVID-19 clinic, cardiology clinic and cardiac rehabilitation services.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Previous reports of cardio-pulmonary thromboembolism in COVID-19 have patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors, primarily diabetes mellitus which is commonly associated with preexisting coronary artery disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy that is frequently undiagnosed owing to its asymptomatic nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. We describe an uncommon case of cardio-pulmonary thromboembolism in an acute COVID-19 patient without any underlying medical issues.\n\n【16】In the literature, there are several theoretical mechanisms linking COVID-19 with atherothrombosis. During an acute infection, enzymes released from activated macrophages break down collagen, which is a major component of the fibrous cap found on atherosclerotic plaques, leading to plaque instability. Proinflammatory macrophages then release tissue factor which triggers the coagulation cascade causing hypercoagulability and thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis are in a hyperinflammatory and prothrombotic state due to the increased production of inflammatory cytokines and thrombotic markers such as fibrinogen and D-Dimer. The cytokine storm produced triggers platelet activation, thrombin formation and finally multiorgan thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells and since ACE2 receptors are widely expressed in arterial endothelial cells, direct vascular injury caused by COVID-19 may lead to endothelial dysfunction and intraluminal thrombosis. These findings are in keeping with histological studies by Varga et al. which showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 material within endothelial cells and accumulation of inflammatory cells with evidence of cell necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】A timely reperfusion strategy should be the mainstay of treatment for STEMI and management protocols should be tailored to suit regional heterogeneity in healthcare resources. The latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) as the reperfusion therapy of choice if performed within 120 min and may be delayed up to an additional 60 min due to logistic reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions and other expert groups have recommended the prompt use of fibrinolytic therapy in selected patients with STEMI if delays are inevitable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Observational studies have demonstrated that COVID-19 patients have a greater thrombus burden with higher rates of stent thrombosis, requiring aspiration thrombectomy and _glycoprotein IIb_ / _IIIa_ inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】As we enter a new phase of the pandemic, further research must continue to improve our understanding of the viral–host interaction to help guide effective therapies, especially the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. Although there is a broad differential diagnosis for myocardial injury, awareness of the lethal cardio-pulmonary sequalae of COVID-19 is important as surges continue across the world owing to new variants.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A written and signed consent for publication of clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Avinash Radhakrishna (A.R) is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:38:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:39:15", "cost": 34.49}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:39:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:38:40"}

Emergency thoracotomy demonstrated an acute longitudinal tear of the innominate artery/brachiocephalic trunk at the junction of the subclavian and common carotid arteries.

She had a background of systemic sclerosis complicated by a renal crisis 15 years previously, for which she was on mycophenolate mofetil maintenance therapy. She also had rectal carcinoma in 2016 with subsequent abdominoperineal resection and end-colostomy formation.\n\n【4】After developing dyspnoea within minutes, she was transported to hospital via ambulance where her neck swelling worsened, causing hypoxia and cardio-respiratory arrest. Endotracheal intubation was not possible due to severe tracheal deviation, and an emergency surgical tracheostomy was performed. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 60 minutes, with multiple instances of loss of cardiac output in the interim. She continued to bleed profusely from her tracheostomy site and was transferred to theatre immediately for emergency surgery due to suspicion of ongoing active bleeding within the upper chest. Clamshell thoracotomy was performed which revealed an acute longitudinal tear of the innominate artery/brachiocephalic trunk at the junction of the subclavian and common carotid arteries. This was successfully repaired; however, the patient died on the intensive care unit 48 hours later of multi-organ failure and hypoxic brain injury.\n\n【5】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【6】Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-mediated disorder resulting in fibrosis of the skin and internal organs as well as a fibroproliferative vasculopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Changes in the microvasculature and endothelium are a prominent feature of SSc, but macrovascular changes related to atherosclerosis can be accelerated as in other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, leading to a higher mortality risk from cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Arterial aneurysms and dissections have been occasionally reported in SSc patients, with focal arteritis affecting small and medium sized vessels thought to be the underlying pathogenesis for aneurysmal changes in connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Long-term steroid usage may have a contributory role in vascular fragility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and there is a suggestion that prolonged steroid use may lead to disintegration of the intima media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Intracranial aneurysms have been reported in the context of CREST syndrome; however, these vessels may be particularly susceptible to focal changes due to the lack of perivascular support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Non-traumatic innominate artery rupture is an extremely rare event. Certain conditions may predispose to this outcome including aneurysms from degenerative arterial disease, Takayasu’s disease, Marfan’s syndrome and syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Invasive infection, radiotherapy, malignant invasion and heritable vascular conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may also predispose to rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous arterial rupture in a patient with systemic sclerosis. Our patient did not have any of the above risk factors and aneurysmal disease was not found at the time of surgical repair. Tracheostomy can lead to innominate artery injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> but is unlikely to be the cause here given the nature of presentation and pronounced haemodynamic compromise prior to insertion. Whilst direct causation from her systemic sclerosis is difficult to prove, her history of previous vascular complications in the form of a renal crisis along with potential ongoing microvascular damage, in the absence of known risk factors for spontaneous rupture, makes a contributory role to her fatal outcome likely.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare we have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this article.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Written_ consent for publication has been obtained from the next of kin.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Sabreen Ali.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:44:41", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:44:54", "cost": 13.773}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:44:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:44:41"}

On examination, pallor was found to be present. Then ultrasonography of abdomen was done and it showed mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Sputum for acid-fast Bacilli was examined and found to be negative but despite this, based on the epidemiological data, antitubercular therapy (ATT) was started but after 2 weeks no clinical improvement was found. Then, fine-needle aspiration cytology of lymph node was done and it resulted in the presence of cryptococcal lymphadenitis as the final report. Antifungal therapy was initiated with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole and there was clinical improvement. Ultrasonographical findings also supported it. Though it is a rare case (but not impossible) that cryptococcus is the cause of lymphadenopathy. Thus, in initial presentation of acquired immuno deficiency syndrome it should always be kept in mind that such cases may happen. In India, presuming _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ as the leading cause exposes the patient to unwanted hepatic and renal toxicity of ATT.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has varied presentation of which, lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation at any stage of the disease due to different underlying causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most common of them being the opportunistic infections and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. India is a tubercular endemic country. It gives a good tilt to assume tuberculosis as the most common cause of lymphadenopathy in HIV-infected patients. This background confuses the treating physician in some of the cases. Thus, broadening the thought spectrum we present here a case of cryptococcal lymphadenitis which is a very unusual initial presentation of AIDS. This is a case that very few studies have reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 45-year-old male hailing from Dhanbad district of Jharkhand state working as a staff in a courier service reported to medicine OPD of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Dhanbad with the chief complain of—soreness of mouth and difficulty in swallowing both solid and liquid since past 1 month, multiple episodes of fever on and off for one and a half months, mild cough with scanty expectoration and weight loss (not documented) since past 2 months.\n\n【6】Patient was apparently asymptomatic 2 months ago when his complaints started in the form of mild cough with scanty expectorations. It was gradual in onset, non-progressive, no diurnal variation. Symptoms sometimes showed relief on taking cough syrup containing codeine and dextromethorphan. The sputum was white in colour, non-blood tinged and mucoid in consistency. Patient also complained of loosening of clothes which used to fit him earlier.\n\n【7】Since past one and a half months, he complained of multiple episodes of fever on and off with no particular pattern. It was gradual in onset, non-progressive though little relief was seen on taking paracetamol. Gradually, the patient developed soreness of mouth and difficulty in swallowing both solid and liquid food items. It was gradual in onset with no complaint of burning sensation in mouth or heart burn.\n\n【8】Before the start of these complains or during this period, he was not on any drug (except for cough syrup and paracetamol).\n\n【9】On general physical examination, he was thin built, febrile, weighed 42 kg, BP 120/80 mmHg, pulse 96/min. Pallor was present. No icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema. On the examination of oral cavity, white keratotic lesions were seen over vestibular and buccal mucosa, suspected to be verrucous leukoplakia.\n\n【10】On systemic examination, no abnormalities were detected. Laboratory data revealed Hb 9.2 gm%, TC 2700/mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophil 79% and lymphocyte 21%. Ultrasonography (USG) of whole abdomen showed multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes (largest being 28 mm).This made us think that the patient was suffering from abdominal tuberculosis which might have disseminated from the lungs. So, now sputum was analysed for acid-fast Bacilli which was negative. Rest all investigations like chest X-ray, electrolytes, kidney function test, random sugar, routine urine, liver function test and lipid profile were within normal limit. Then blood was tested for HIV I and II and was found to be positive for HIV I. Therefore, he was now registered at the Anti Retroviral Therapy centre of PMCH Dhanbad on 28-03-2017. CD <sub>4 </sub> count was 58/mm <sup>3 </sup> which signifies stage 4 of the disease.\n\n【11】Based on high clinical suspicion and the epidemiological data, his treatment was started with antitubercular therapy (ATT) Cat-I on 30-03-2017 (consisting of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) and HAART (consisting of Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz) after 2 weeks on 14 April 2017 to avoid immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Even after 2 weeks, no clinical improvement was seen in the patient which according to the literature is one of the criteria to state that the patient had tuberculosis and get cured following ATT administration. Failure of above treatment advised us to do USG guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. Cytological reports showed large masses of round yeast like structure with negatively stained capsule admixed with lymphoid cells, plasma cells, foamy macrophages, epitheloid cells in the background of necrotic debris. These suggested a possibility of fungal (Cryptococcus) necrotizing granuloma involving the lymph nodes. No acid-fast bacilli were seen.\n\n【12】Following this report, ATT was stopped on 27 April 2017 and patient was referred to Rajendra Institute of Medical Science, Ranchi where he was treated with injection amphotericin B for 7 days followed by oral fluconazole and flucytosine. Flucytosine could not be continued after discharge from hospital due to financial constraints. After 15 days, patient came for follow-up and there was improvement in clinical symptoms and with the gain of 2 kg weight. The USG showed a decrease in size of the lymph nodes.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Cryptococcal infection is very much prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) especially in developing country like India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Approximately 1 million PLHIV are infected by this fungus and about 625 000 die annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The most common organ affected by this fungus in these patients is the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Lymphadenopathy due to cryptococcus is a very rare disease in PLHIV so any lymphadenopathy in AIDS patients should be thoroughly investigated. Though less but some such cases having similar picture have been reported from worldwide and India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A case has been described in a research article by U. Banerjee about a patient from north-eastern India presenting with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss and was suspected to have tuberculosis. ATT, however, was ineffective. So, a lymph node biopsy was done which revealed abundant _Cryptococcus neoformans_ cells. Following this, HIV seropositivity was suspected, and later confirmed. Afterwards, the serum was examined for cryptococcal antigen which was found to be positive. However, no CNS symptoms were present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In a case report by Dogbey _et al._ , final diagnosis was confirmed by lymph node biopsy but FNAC was suggested to diagnose such cases with both rapid and cost-effective method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Often, such cases are overlooked because we rarely suspect about Cryptococcus being a cause of lymphadenitis. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, cryptococcosis is one of the AIDS-defining criteria. Almost similar chief complaint of fever and weight loss over 15 days duration in an AIDS patient was seen in case report by Chandanwale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Finally, the diagnosis of supraclavicular lymphadenitis was pinned down to Cryptococcus which was diagnosed by FNAC. From the above case study and discussion, we hereby conclude that despite vast clinical experience and support from the epidemiology of a disease like ‘tuberculosis’ in India we should properly evaluate lymphadenopathy allowing FNAC as the minimum investigation. At times we miss this rare but important factor of lymphadenopathy in treating AIDS patients. This timely initiation of therapy shall also help to decrease the morbidity and mortality due to cryptococcosis in such patients.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding source.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEGEMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PATIENT’S CONSENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent from the patient has been obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:03", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:46:58", "cost": 55.339}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:46:03"}

Despite current evidence providing an overview of the clinical characteristics of HT patients with COVID-19, there is a gap in pathological research regarding the specific mechanisms of viral infection in these patients. This report follows the unique case of a 57-year-old female who contracted COVID-19 11 days post-HT and developed concurrent pathological antibody-mediated rejection (pAMR). Further investigations have shown the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated cardiac injury presenting similarly to antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), resulting in a diagnostic conundrum.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted multiple times to the hospital for heart failure and cardiogenic shock in 2020. In July 2020, an echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 11%. The patient was known for atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, transient ischemic attack and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was an ex-smoker of 30-pack-years who quit 6 months prior to transplant. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease, with her father and grandfather having experienced myocardial infarctions in their 60s.\n\n【6】In December 2020, the patient received a HT. On 6 January 2021 (11 days later), she tested positive for COVID-19 due to an in-hospital outbreak. A week following, she developed increased oxygen requirements and a right-sided pleural effusion on chest computed tomography (CT). Although the patient noted shortness of breath when lying flat or with movement, she was not in acute respiratory distress and was hemodynamically stable with normal heart function on echocardiography. Despite initially being diagnosed with pAMR of the cardiac allograft , subsequent investigations have suggested a potential presentation of COVID-19 infection resembling pAMR in the heart of this patient .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Immunohistochemical staining of patient biopsies.

At the time of transplant, the patient had a moderate (mean fluorescence intensity = 4149) DSA to HLA DPB1\\*04:01 detected. The B-cell flow cross-match was reported to be negative; although the B-cell shift was below the threshold level of 80, the shift toward the positive cutoff was consistent with the moderate donor-specific antibody to DP0401. Immunohistochemistry detected positive staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the explanted recipient heart tissue despite a negative nasopharyngeal swab test. Following cardiac transplant, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on 4 January 2021, and positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 6 January. The patient’s 4 January post-transplant biopsy showed no acute cellular rejection (grade 0R) and immunohistochemical evidence of pAMR1(I+). An echocardiogram revealed improving cardiac function from the time of transplant.\n\n【10】After her COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient became increasingly hypoxemic but was otherwise hemodynamically stable with normal heart function by echocardiogram. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone from 10–23 January for COVID-19. The pAMR in her cardiac allograft appeared to become more persistent as her hospital stay progressed. On 20 January and 27 January, cardiac allograft biopsies showed pAMR2, which slowly resolved until the patient was discharged on 26 February. Given her stability on echocardiogram, she was not treated for pAMR. Compared to the CT-chest on 12 January, which showed a ground-glass lung phenotype consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, the 26 January CT-chest demonstrated marked recovery. The patient tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 on 7 February, via nasopharyngeal swab. The reports of transplant rejection were congruent with COVID-19 positivity and diminished with viral clearance.\n\n【11】At discharge, she was taking multiple medications, including tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate, acetylsalicylic acid and pravastatin. Neither intubation nor mechanical ventilation was required throughout her hospital stay. At the time of her 10 March biopsy, she had no evidence of pAMR.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Allograft rejection is responsible of 10% of deaths within the initial 3 years after transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury have a 51.2% increase in-hospital mortality compared to those without 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Immunohistochemistry detected positive staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the explanted recipient heart tissue despite a negative nasopharyngeal swab test. Following cardiac transplant, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on 4 January 2021, and positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 6 January. The patient’s 4 January post-transplant biopsy showed no acute cellular rejection (grade 0R) and immunohistochemical evidence of pAMR1(I+). An echocardiogram revealed improving cardiac function from the time of transplant.\n\n【10】After her COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient became increasingly hypoxemic but was otherwise hemodynamically stable with normal heart function by echocardiogram. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone from 10–23 January for COVID-19. The pAMR in her cardiac allograft appeared to become more persistent as her hospital stay progressed. On 20 January and 27 January, cardiac allograft biopsies showed pAMR2, which slowly resolved until the patient was discharged on 26 February. Given her stability on echocardiogram, she was not treated for pAMR. Compared to the CT-chest on 12 January, which showed a ground-glass lung phenotype consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, the 26 January CT-chest demonstrated marked recovery. The patient tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 on 7 February, via nasopharyngeal swab. The reports of transplant rejection were congruent with COVID-19 positivity and diminished with viral clearance.\n\n【11】At discharge, she was taking multiple medications, including tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate, acetylsalicylic acid and pravastatin. Neither intubation nor mechanical ventilation was required throughout her hospital stay. At the time of her 10 March biopsy, she had no evidence of pAMR.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Allograft rejection is responsible of 10% of deaths within the initial 3 years after transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury have a 51.2% increase in-hospital mortality compared to those without 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although there are no current studies on the combination of pAMR and COVID-19, it is hypothesized that worse outcomes will be documented, warranting further investigation.\n\n【14】PAMR is typically treated with the goal to stop immune-mediated injury and supporting cardiac failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although there is no current diagnostic consensus, corticosteroids and intravenous gamma globulin have widely been reported as therapeutics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. For severe COVID-19 manifestations, antivirals, anticoagulation and immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK 1,2 inhibitors) are often prescribed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Corticosteroids contribute to T-cell and B-cell suppression though the specific effects of dexamethasone on pAMR remain to be elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The criteria for pAMR2 requires histological (capillary endothelial swelling and macrophages within capillaries) and immunopathologic (C4d) findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Correspondingly, these indicators are also characteristic of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury.\n\n【16】Although C4d is a marker of pAMR, research also implicates this protein as a hallmark of COVID-19-mediated infection. Deposits of C4d have been found in the heart, lung, brain, skin and liver tissue which is compatible with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RNA localization and ACE2 receptor presence in severe COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Control patients had no deposits, while all COVID-19 tissue examined were positive for C4d通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>7 </sup></u> .\n\n【17】Macrophages, characterized by CD68 expression and a vital component in AMR diagnosis, have been found to play a prominent role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Various mechanisms, including macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm, have been reported in the hearts of COVID-19 patients and contribute to thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Capillary endothelial changes (CD31) have also been observed in COVID-19 patients. Compared to controls, COVID-19 positive patients were found to express high levels of the SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor ACE2 in capillaries, consistent with findings of endotheliitis and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Based on current research regarding the role of C4d, macrophages and capillary endothelial changes in COVID-19 pathogenesis in the heart , in addition to reports of AMR consistent with SARS-CoV-2 positivity , an enigma has been presented regarding the role of COVID-19 in the clinical presentation of this patient.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent obtained.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>P.H. is nominated as the manuscript’s guarantor.</u>", "index": 7753, "show": true, "start": 7753, "end": 7765, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "16"}], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:29:44", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:30:08", "cost": 24.485}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:30:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:29:44"}

The majority of foodborne illness is transient and self-limited, while life threatening complications are rare. Here, we describe a case of a patient presenting with inflammatory diarrhea after consumption of undercooked seafood. She developed mesenteric and portal venous thrombosis and small bowel infarction requiring surgical intervention and resection of gangrenous small bowel. This is a rare presentation and outcome of common food poisoning. The case report is followed by a brief discussion of common foodborne illnesses and mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 65-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and essential thrombocytosis (on hydroxyurea) presented with complaints of acute-onset nausea, vomiting and diarrhea 2 days prior to admission. She had eaten seafood at a local restaurant the night before her symptoms started. Symptoms started within hours of eating that food. She complained of abdominal pain which was centered in the right lower quadrant and was colicky in nature. The intensity of pain varied from 6 to 7 on scale out of 10. On admission, the patient was found to be hypotensive. Abdominal exam revealed distended belly with hypoactive bowel sounds. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen done on admission did not show any acute findings. Mesenteric and portal veins were well opacified without any thrombus. The patient was given intravenous fluids and started on ciprofloxacin along with metronidazole. Despite this initial treatment, the patient's condition continued to worsen, with new-onset low grade fevers and persistent vomiting. Her abdominal tenderness worsened and bowel sounds remained hypoactive. A repeat CT scan on Day 3 of admission showed evidence of high-grade small bowel obstruction along with mucosal edema. It also showed thrombus in superior mesenteric vein  and portal vein with early gangrenous changes of small bowel. Based on these radiographic findings, she was taken for urgent laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included gangrene of the small bowel starting from 35 cm distal to the duodenojejunal flexure to the mid-transverse colon with no perforation. The superior mesenteric vein was thrombosed with cord like appearance. Based on these findings, the patient underwent a near-total small bowel resection. Postoperatively, the patient was started on enoxaparin for anticoagulation due to the findings of thrombosis in the mesenteric vein. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics were continued after the surgery. The patient initially responded favorably and was started on liquid diet. Improvement continued and antibiotics were discontinued on postoperative Day 6. Fourteen days after surgery, however, the patient developed acute abdominal pain. CT at this time showed pneumato-intestinalis  of remaining part of proximal small gut along with pneumobilia and air in portal vein , along with massive splenic and liver infarct. At this point, the family refused further intervention and the patient was transitioned to hospice care.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Thrombus in superior mesenteric vein and dilated small bowel loops.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Pneumatosis intestinalis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Air in portal vein branches.</u>\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Before we embark on a discussion of MVT, we will briefly discuss common foodborne illnesses. As per recent estimates, there are 9.4 million foodborne illnesses in USA, requiring hospitalization in 55 961 cases and leading to 1351 deaths annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In the majority of cases, a diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation and generally does not require confirmatory laboratory tests. A typical case will present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. Some infections, however, will have additional features which can help distinguish the microbiologic cause of the illness. For example, jaundice and right upper quadrant pain are associated with Hepatitis A and E, paralysis is associated with botulism, and headaches and paresthesias are associated with Ciguatera fish poisoning or Scombroid. Even among the common symptoms of foodborne illness, some features tend to be associated more with certain pathogens than others:\n\n【11】1.  Vomiting as the major presenting symptom is seen in food poisoning cases with _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Bacillus cereus_ , noroviruses and anisakiasis.\n\n【12】2.  Watery diarrhea is the most common presentation seen with _Vibrio cholera_ , _Clostridium perfringes_ , enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ , rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and _Cyclospora_ .\n\n【13】3.  Inflammatory diarrhea, which is diagnosed by the presence of inflammatory cells and blood in stools, severe abdominal pain, along with fever is usually seen with _Salmonella_ , _Campylobacter_ , Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ , _Shigella_ , non-cholera _Vibrio_ and _Yersinia_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of these conditions are self-limited and resolve without any specific intervention. Volume repletion is the mainstay of management in such cases. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated and should generally be avoided except in patients with severe illness, those at high risk of complications including elderly or immunosuppressed patients, or when symptom persist for >1 week despite conservative management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Some patients at high risk for more severe complications may experience hypotension, dehydration and occasionally peritonitis. MVT is a rare complication of foodborne illness. Given the low frequency of occurrence, the diagnosis may be delayed, as patients with inflammatory diarrhea have symptoms that overlap with symptoms of MVT. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion for MVT is critical to diagnosing the condition early enough to successfully intervene, especially in patients who may be predisposed to thromboses, such as those with polycythemia or essential thrombocytosis.\n\n【15】Acute MVT is an uncommon disorder with non-specific signs and symptoms. It was first described over 100 years ago by Elliot, who in 1895 published two cases of small bowel infarction caused by thrombosis of mesenteric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Among all mesenteric ischemic events, venous thrombus is estimated to account for only 5–15% cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. MVT has been estimated to account for one in 5000–15 000 inpatient admissions and one in 1000 emergency surgical laparotomies for acute abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The superior mesenteric vein is more commonly involved than the inferior mesenteric vein. Venous thrombosis is predominantly a result of stagnation of blood flow, vascular injury and hypercoagulability. MVT is classified as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to known etiologic factors. Underlying causes for MVT are found in ~75% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Risk factors for MVT include:\n\n【16】*   Heritable thrombophilias—antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden mutation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hyperfibrinogenemia, plasminogen deficiency, protein C and S deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation and Sickle cell disease.\n\n【17】*   Acquired thrombophilias and systemic hypercoagulable states—antiphospholipid antibodies, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, myeloproliferative disease, malignancy, pregnancy, decompression sickness and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【18】*   Intra-abdominal causes—cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal volvulus, intra-abdominal infection, pancreatitis and postoperative state.\n\n【19】Presentation of MVT can be acute, subacute or chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Acute MVT presents with sudden onset of abdominal pain progressing to signs and symptoms of bowel infarction and peritonitis. Subacute cases present with abdominal pain for days to weeks without gut infarction, while chronic cases generally present with complications of portal vein or splenic vein thrombosis like esophageal variceal bleeding.\n\n【20】A high degree of suspicion is required to make timely diagnosis in acute cases, due to both the rarity of the disease as well as the severe clinical consequences of delayed intervention. Lactate is generally elevated due to gut ischemia, but may be normal upon initial presentation. Other common signs include elevated white blood cell count and stool positive for occult blood, which is present in over 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, no laboratory test is specific for MVT, so diagnosis generally requires abdominal imaging. Plain film X-ray, while not particularly sensitive or specific, may reveal mucosal edema, pneumatosis intestinalis, or air in the portal vein or peritoneal cavity due to infarcted bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ultrasound with Doppler can often detect thrombosis in mesenteric veins; however, technical difficulties such as air in gut loops obscuring proper evaluation of blood vessels can limit the utility of this test. Magnetic resonance venography is quite sensitive; however, it may not be feasible in acute cases as patients are usually significant pain and may not be clinically stable enough to undergo a prolonged test. CT remains the imaging modality of choice to diagnose MVT, reliably identifying the disease in over 90% of cases. CT findings include central lucency in the mesenteric vein (filling defect), enlargement of the involved vein and a sharply defined wall of vein with a rim of increased density. All of these findings are evident even in the early stages of the MVT. In later stages after infarction has occurred, CT may show pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Other diagnostic techniques include abdominal paracentesis and selective mesenteric venous angiography; however, with the wide availability of CT, these methods are now rarely used to diagnose MVT.\n\n【21】The goal of initial treatment for acute MVT is to prevent intestinal infarction by reperfusion of the affected bowel. Initial treatment for all patients should include bowel rest, nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, prophylactic antibiotics and parenteral anticoagulation. Surgery is indicated in patients who show signs and symptoms of peritonitis, hemodynamic instability or bowel infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The mortality rate associated with acute MVT ranges from 20 to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In patients who survive an initial episode, recurrence may present within 1 month of initial presentation. The recurrence rate is lower in patients who receive both anticoagulation and surgery compared to those treated with anticoagulation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we present a case of patient who developed mesenteric and portal venous thrombosis after a foodborne illness. She was predisposed to MVT given her underlying hypercoagulability as well as the dehydration and inflammation associated with the diarrhea from her acute gastrointestinal illness. As a result of the MVT, she subsequently developed infarcted small bowel and splenic and hepatic infarcts. She underwent laparotomy where infarcted small bowel was resected and then was started on systemic anticoagulation. Despite all these efforts she was not able to fully recover and eventually expired. This case is unique as she developed this life threating condition after a minor bout of food poisoning, which in most cases would not prompt further diagnostic workup. The case highlights the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion for MVT in patients who present with severe acute gastrointestinal illness that may be predisposed to thrombosis, allowing for prompt identification and treatment of the condition.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:02:05", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:03:13", "cost": 68.093}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:03:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:02:04"}

He had no previous medical history of malignant disease and supplement or medication use. All nails showed yellow discoloration with delayed growth . He had mild bilateral pitting pedal edema and negative Stemmer sign; unremarkable blood tests; and normal tumor marker levels and interferon gamma release assays.\n\n【7】High-resolution chest-computed tomography showed right pleural effusion and bronchiectasis. In addition, 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed no uptake within the pleura .\n\n【8】He underwent pleuroscopy under local anesthesia to evaluate the pleural lesions and rule out malignant disease. A patchy white pleural thickness was revealed using pleuroscopic findings . The pleural effusion appeared yellow and was exudative effusion with lymphocytic predominance. Pleural fluid cultures were negative results, including for acid-fast bacteria. Pathological findings on pleural biopsy showed non-specific inflammation compatible with fibrotic pleurisy. These results raised suspicion for YNS.\n\n【9】Lymphatic vessel irregularities have been reported in YNS, and so we first attempted ultrasound-guided intranodal lymphangiography via direct puncture of the inguinal lymph nodes. However, puncturing was technically difficult because of atypical lymph node atrophy. Next, we attempted puncturing the lymphatic vessels from the dorsum of the foot via a skin incision but the vessels were too small. Alternatively, we performed contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography with subcutaneous injection of 1 ml of a mixture of gadolinium-based contrast medium (Gadoteridol) and 1% lidocaine (Gadoteridol and 1% lidocaine are mixed in a ratio of 9:1) into the dorsum of the foot. We performed four dynamic phase acquisitions at 5, 15, 25 and 35 min after subcutaneous injection. The lymphatic vessels of the thighs were few and barely identifiable, indicating poor flow cranially and lymphatic vessel hypoplasia at 35 min after subcutaneous injection . There were few irregular tortuous longitudinal lymphatic vessels of varying caliber in the region of both legs . These findings were suggestive of dysplasia of the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes; thus a diagnosis of YNS was made.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography 35 min after contrast medium injection showing irregular lymphatic vessels in the lower limbs.

Eventually, he rapidly became emaciated and developed recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient died of respiratory failure 6 months after the diagnosis of YNS.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】YNS is associated with structural and functional lymphatic system abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, most reports of these lymphatic abnormalities are based on pathological findings at autopsy or indirect findings on lymphatic scintigraphy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first report on contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography demonstrating high-accuracy comprehensive imaging of lymphatic vessel abnormalities in a patient with YNS.\n\n【14】Proof of lymphatic vessel abnormality has been based on a diagnostic technique involving direct puncture of the inguinal lymph nodes or lymphatic vessels of the dorsum of the foot and contrast medium injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. However, the lymphatic vessels and nodes in YNS are typically hypoplastic, so this puncture technique requires high-level skills. In addition, there has been a previous report of non-enhanced MR lymphangiography in YNS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, still, it has problems with field heterogeneity and radiofrequency labeling inefficiency, making it difficult to visualize normal or hypoplastic lymphatic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, we conducted a contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography by subcutaneous injection as an alternative, easily implementable imaging modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The examination of contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography was simple, needing only a subcutaneous injection of MR imaging (MRI) contrast medium into the dorsum of the foot, followed by an MRI scan. The major advantage of contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography compared with non-enhanced MR lymphangiography is the ability to clearly delineate abnormal lymphatic vessels due to the high spatial and temporal resolution. The pre-contrast sequence was performed in our patient, but lymphatic vessels could not be delineated with a low signal on T1-weighted images. Moreover, MR lymphangiography is preferable to lymphatic scintigraphy as it better depicts lymphatic vessel morphology that gives a more comprehensive picture of vessel abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Regarding side effects, our patient experienced only mild local pain and swelling due to the subcutaneous injection. There were no serious adverse events such as skin necrosis.\n\n【16】Thus, our patient’s lymphatic vessels had various abnormalities, including dilatation and stenosis. There were fewer lymphatic vessels than in healthy subjects, suggesting lymphatic hypoplasia. Only mild edema of the lower extremities was revealed in the physical examination, although lymphangiography exhibited abnormal manifestations. Contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography can be useful in lymphedema cases that are challenging to diagnose based on clinical findings alone, as in our patient.\n\n【17】Definitive diagnosis and treatment of YNS are often challenging, and it is likely underdiagnosed. Lymphatic abnormalities are considered a characteristic finding, and MR lymphangiography may be a useful novel diagnostic modality for YNS. However, further accumulation of cases is needed.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was needed for this case report.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained written informed consent from the wife of the patient after he passed away.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:07", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:30", "cost": 22.772}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:06"}

According to her last menstrual period, she was 10 weeks into pregnancy and using an ultrasonographic evaluation, the diagnosis of caesarian scar pregnancy was confirmed, although this scar pregnancy was misdiagnosed before being admitted. The severe bleeding indicated suction and curettage; however, a Bakri balloon was placed in as the bleeding could not be stopped. The following morning the balloon was removed, and the patient underwent UAE to stop the bleeding fully. One month after the pregnancy, beta human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations became untraceable. Nine months after the incident, the patient presented to the clinic again with amenorrhea. This peculiar event led to obtaining a hysterosalpingography and laboratory evaluation of the AMH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 25.2 IU/mL) and luteinizing hormone (LH; 15.2 IU/mL) levels. As the AMH level was low (0.1 ng/mL), we suspected POI and repeated tests within 6 weeks, and the new test results were as follows: FSH (35.4 IU/mL), LH (20.1 IU/mL) and AMH (0.01 ng/mL). Hysterosalpingography was suggestive of total AS . The first phase of treatment included the hysteroscopic removal of adhesions within the uterine cavity (in 2017). Lower segment adhesions were removed, fundal adhesions were also excised and the left ostium was exposed. It was decided that the patient should undergo another hysteroscopy after hormonal replacement therapy. However, as the patient was frustrated and disappointed about future pregnancies because of likely subfertility, she declined the second hysteroscopy. Within a year of surgery, she started to experience irregular episodes of bleeding again. Her AMH levels were rechecked and had increased to 0.45 ng/mL. She stated that the status of her menstrual periods had become markedly better and that she had experienced irregular episodes of hypomenorrhea. Therefore, the AMH evaluation showed that the levels had increased to 0.45 ng/mL, and the FSH level was 3.0 IU/mL, which was a sign of POI regression. Moreover, ultrasonographic imaging showed that the uterine cavity was free from adhesions . Three years following her hysteroscopy, she became pregnant again, and an ultrasound scan confirmed that the pregnancy was viable and intrauterine (in 2020). As another episode of pregnancy was suspected, a transvaginal sonographic assessment was carried out, which showed that the gestational sac was not in the cesarean scar site. Albeit with such levels of Asherman involvement, it was assumed that the placenta could become adherent. The placenta showed only some mild levels of placenta accreta. During the pregnancy, the patient had been treated with dydrogesterone as luteal phase support up to the 12th week of pregnancy, after which progesterone suppositories were initiated. Two weeks after the start of the second trimester (15th week of gestation), on the 37th week of pregnancy, the patient underwent an elective cesarean section because of previous cesarean section and the evident placenta accreta (neither on the scar nor previa). The newborn was successfully delivered. However, the placenta was markedly adhesive to the uterine cavity’s fundal site, and the uterus was removed (on the same surgical episode) with an abdominal hysterectomy .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Hysterosalpingography evaluation of the patient before surgical evaluation shows that the radiocontrast agent has covered the cervix and isthmus.

Risk factors include previous EP, intrauterine devices, contraceptives and pelvic inflammatory diseases. While the most common form of EP is tubular, CSP is also a prevalent type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. This specific type of EP is usually managed with a combination of methotrexate and surgical approaches such as dilation and curettage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. The presented case was of a woman who suffered from misdiagnosed CSP and uncontrollable vaginal bleeding; hence, she underwent a curettage to terminate the pregnancy and stop the bleeding. However, we used a Bakri balloon and UAE to preserve the uterus.\n\n【13】AS is defined as the formation of scar tissue and intrauterine adhesions or intrauterine synechiae formation inside the uterine cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 12 \\]</u>. The most common causes are endometrial damage during surgeries such as D&C, infections like tuberculosis and congenital anomalies. It usually presents itself with menstrual abnormalities and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The most accurate method of diagnosis is hysteroscopy, but ultrasonographic imaging can also be helpful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 12 \\]</u>. Depending on the scale of involvement and the severity of adhesions, this incidence can be managed either surgically with adhesiolysis or expectantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 12 \\]</u>. This case was a complete Asherman (grade IV), and we decided to carry out surgical intervention.\n\n【14】Meanwhile, premature ovarian failure (POI) is an uncommon etiology of infertility in females characterized by hypoestrogenism, elevated gonadotropin levels and amenorrhea in 1% of women under 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Although pregnancy is a rare incidence among these patients, it is not unheard of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13 \\]</u>. UAE, in many instances, has been reported to have decreased ovarian reserve; it is presumed that the decrease in ovarian perfusion as a consequence of embolization in the uterine artery, which provides a portion of the overall blood supply to ovaries might cause this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 14 \\]</u>. Interestingly, a transient form of ovarian failure could happen in cases of UAE, as did our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 , 14 \\]</u>. In our case, we only resorted to this method only after uncontrollable uterine bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【16】This case was of a woman who developed AS after the treatment for CSP. Despite extremely low initial AMH levels, the patient became pregnant. We assume that the initial hysteroscopic adhesiolysis made the endometrium suitable for implantation. This case highlights that appropriate surgical and medical intervention can improve the chances of future fertility. We assume that AS was developed because of extensive endometrial manipulation and embolization. POI was developed in this case because of UAE, and this risk has been well-reported in previous studies.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DECLARATIONS\n------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>### Ethics approval and consent to participate</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by the research and ethics committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

His MCC was initially treated with radiation, followed by chemotherapy on metastatic recurrence. Chemotherapy initially stabilized the disease, but he experienced significant fatigue and his disease progressed within 3 months. After careful consideration of the risk of a myasthenic crisis, he was commenced on avelumab. He had initial partial response, though he ultimately developed progressive disease which led to a decision for best supportive care at 10 months post starting immunotherapy. Importantly, as per spirometry, his MG remained stable throughout immunotherapy. We present the current case to demonstrate that MG should not be viewed as an absolute contraindication to immunotherapy in scenarios where there are limited alternate therapeutic options.\n\n【2】oncology , neurology\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer with a 5-year-survival rate <20%. Although exquisitely radiosensitive, it is only relatively chemosensitive with a 55% response rate in the first-line setting with median duration of response of 2–8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has increasing evidence, though this is limited to MCCs with high somatostatin receptor expression. In the second-line setting, the JAVELIN trial demonstrated that avelumab (anti-PD-L1) had objective response rates of 33%, with 74% of responses lasting more than 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, leading to immunotherapy becoming a mainstay of treatment. In patients with a pre-existing autoimmune condition, the risks of a flare in the autoimmune condition need to be carefully weighed against potential cancer control. There is scant evidence regarding the use of immunotherapy in patients with pre-existing myasthenia gravis (MG).\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 79-year-old gentleman presented in December 2018 with a rapidly growing right parotid mass that was通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) avid. Core biopsy demonstrated a high-grade tumour with neuroendocrine differentiation favouring metastatic MCC of unknown primary. He completed definitive intent radiotherapy (63 Gray in 30 fractions) in April 2019. Repeat FDG-PET in July 2019 demonstrated marked decrease in size and avidity of the parotid lesion, though a new hypermetabolic liver lesion was detected. Liver biopsy demonstrated metastatic MCC similar to the original core biopsy specimen. He underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (30 Gray in 3 fractions) to the liver lesion and subsequent FDG-PET demonstrated decreased avidity in the liver and new sites of disease .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Serial FDG-PET imaging as presented with serial maximal intensity projections (MIPs).

( **C** ) (Oct 19): Avidity in the hepatic and parotid lesions is decreased, but there were multiple new sites of FDG avidity concerning for disease progression including a right superficial infrascapular mass, SUVmax 10.5 and a left para-aortic node level of T8, SUVmax 5.1 (and a smaller node posterior to this SUVmax 2.6). There are also multiple new abdominal masses, most prominently inferior to the duodenum, SUVmax 8.8, and several mesenteric and peritoneal (LHS > RHS) avid nodules with SUV max up to 9.5.</u>\n\n【8】Our patient had MG diagnosed in June 2018 after developing progressive weakness with normal creatinine kinase, positive ACh-R-Ab and confirmatory single-fibre electromyography. This was managed by his neurologist with prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and mycophenolate . He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002, which was treated with definitive radiotherapy, and he remained in remission as confirmed with persistently negative prostate-specific antigen making a paraneoplastic MG highly unlikely. He mobilized with a walking stick, required some assistance with personal care, but had greater subjective sense of fatigue than clinical fatigable weakness from MG.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Timeline of the Ach-R-Ab titre alongside the main treatments of MCC, immunosuppressive agents used and timing of the radiographic restaging scans.</u>\n\n【10】His通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>68 </sup></u> Ga-DOTATATE PET scan revealed multiple sites of DOTATATE non-avid, FDG avid MCC and thus PRRT was not a therapeutic option. Due to concerns of giving immunotherapy with his underlying MG, he proceeded with single-agent carboplatin (rather than carboplatin/etoposide due to his functional status) in November 2019. The chemotherapy was ceased in January 2020 due to thrombocytopenia and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status dropping to 2. Repeat computed tomography (CT) in February 2020 demonstrated progressive intra-abdominal disease as well as a cerebellar lesion for which he received stereotactic radiosurgery. Discussion was conducted by both the oncologist and neurologist with the patient regarding the risk of avelumab exacerbating his MG event to the point of death weighed by the fact that there were no other remaining treatment options. There was also a precedent case report successfully maintaining IVIG to control autoimmune disease concurrently with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Given his desire to continue systemic treatment, he opted to proceed. After his first dose, he reported subjective fatiguability but was managing at home with no respiratory or swallowing issues. He had a progression-free survival (PFS) (from treatment initiation to progression of MCC) of 4 months . When CT in August 2020 showed progressive disease in two bilateral para-renal masses, he underwent five fractions of external beam radiotherapy to these lesions. They reduced in size initially, but CT in January 2021 demonstrated significant progressive disease, which led to cessation of avelumab . He had no increase in dyspnoea and neurology review found no evidence of MG flare. He was treated with best supportive care and died in February 2021.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Serial CT imaging (Feb 20, May 20) demonstrating effect of immunotherapy on para-aortic and retrocrural lymph node.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Areas of disease and their response to treatment (on CT).

As the use of immunotherapy continues to rise, it safety and effect in patients with pre-existent autoimmune conditions are increasingly relevant.\n\n【15】The AIM-NIVO trial assessing the efficacy of nivolumab in patients with autoimmune disorders and advanced malignancies is due to be completed in 2022 which will increase our data in these patients, though we note MG is not included in this cohort. In a literature search, we found 27 cases of immunotherapy-related MG. A 2017 review reported 23 cases; 72.7% were _de novo_ MG, 18.2% were exacerbations of pre-existent MG and 9.1% were exacerbations of subclinical MG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. There are four further published case reports, one with a partial response with no flare of MG and three cases who experienced a myasthenic crisis in the setting of immunotherapy treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In a 2017 study of 52 patients on immunotherapy, 38% of patients with an underlying autoimmune disorder subsequently had a flare of their disorder. Of the patients who had a flare, 60% had active disease at time of treatment and 50% were on immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. As titrated by his neurologist, while on immunotherapy, our patient was on a relatively low dose of prednisolone and while the cessation of mycophenolate was possible, escalation of IVIG was required. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that patients on immunosuppression at the start of anti-PD-1 treatment had lower response rate, PFS and overall survival compared to those not on immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. For our patient, the prednisolone and IVIG concurrent throughout the avelumab theoretically could have decreased the effect of the avelumab. However, there is a precedent case report whereby a patient with underlying Guillain–Barre syndrome was maintained on IVIG while achieving durable complete response of their metastatic colon cancer with pembrolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the second-line setting, in line with the JAVELIN trial, our patient had 4 months of PFS on avelumab compared to median PFS of 61 days seen with second-line chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As such, rather than an autoimmune condition being a contraindication to immunotherapy, more data are needed to guide the immunosuppressant agents and doses, which can be used concurrently to enable therapeutic options for cancer, especially when all alternative options have been exhausted.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent sought from patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been received from patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:36:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:36:56", "cost": 15.175}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:29", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:40"}

Despite its benign nature, RDD can cause serious hematological complications. A 14-year-old male, presented with 3-month history of hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and rash. After thorough investigation, RDD was diagnosed by mediastinal lymph node biopsy that revealed presence of S100 and CD68-positive cells with absence of CD1a confirming the diagnosis of RDD. Treatment involved combination of steroids and Rituximab, which proved to be highly effective. The patient had dramatic improvement and entered remission, with follow-up period of 2 years. It is important to note that although RDD is a rare disease, it causes severe complications, as evidenced by the patient's parameters. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. Histological diagnosis is of great value, as it helps confirming and guiding treatment decisions. With the right treatment, patients can experience great recovery and quality of life.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) has been classified as a rare nonmalignant condition marked by significant histiocyte proliferation in lymph nodes of the head and neck since its initial classification as a distinct pathological entity in 1969 as an uncommon instance of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, also known as sinus histiocytosis with extensive lymphadenopathy. RDD has a 1 in 200 000 incidence, affects more men and patients of African descent than other demographics and skin involvement is more frequent in Asian women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although the primary cause of RDD is still unknown, viral diseases such as the herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus may play a role in its development. RDD is characterized histologically by CD1a negativity, CD68 and S100 positivity. Depending on the afflicted areas, RDD may be categorized into three subtypes: nodal, extra-nodal and mixed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Herein, we present a case of a 14-year-old male who presented with rash that was later diagnosed with RDD complicated by hemolytic anemia.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 14-year-old male patient presented with a 3-month history of non-painful patches of skin hyper and hypo-pigmentations, distributed over the trunk area.\n\n【8】The patient initially sought medical advice from a dermatologist who treated him with antifungals as a case of fungal skin infection without improvement. At that time, he had no history of fever, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, hematuria or previous episodes.\n\n【9】Over the next months, he developed fatigue and exertional shortness of breath upon activity and reported occasional night sweats with undocumented weight loss. However, he didn’t seek medical advice until 3 months had elapsed, when he developed yellowish discoloration of his sclera associated with dark urine and no change in stool color.\n\n【10】On examination, patient had scleral icterus and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed hemolysis with hemoglobin levels of 5 g/dl, mean cell volume of 122.7 fL with normal folate and vitamin B12 levels, elevated reticulocyte count of 17.2%, red blood cells (RBCs) 0.79 × 106/μl, with leukocytosis and eosinophilia (25 × 103/μl and 7% respectively) and normal platelet count.\n\n【11】Anisocytosis was found on peripheral blood smear, with teardrops, microcytic hypochromic cells, schistocytes and nucleated RBCs consistent with acute hemolysis. Coombs test was significantly positive, indicating autoimmune hemolytic anemia, high lactate dehydrogenase 576 U/L and bilirubin 4 mg/dl, Direct Bilirubin 0.21 mg/dl, decreased haptoglobin levels and normal liver enzymes.\n\n【12】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 94 mm by the end of the first hour and the C-reactive protein was 19 mg/dl. Body fluids tested negative for microbiology. The viral panel was negative for Epstein–Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Brucella and toxoplasma.\n\n【13】Coagulation, autoantibodies and kidney function profiles, urinalysis, complement levels were all normal. Immunoglobulin levels were normal except for elevated IgE: 459 IU/ml. Abdominal ultrasound showed a liver span of 14.5 cm and spleen of 16 cm with otherwise normal findings.\n\n【14】Chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed enlarged lymph nodes in the perihilar regions of the lungs with hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【15】The symptoms continued with a progressive course. The patient was ill-looking, but stable vitally except for tachycardia. He was maintained on supportive care and was given packed red blood cells. A lymph node biopsy taken from the mediastinum via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery showed sinusoids filled with S100 and CD68-positive but CD1a-negative, confirming the diagnosis of RDD .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|RDD.

He was discharged on Prednisolone 40 mg daily with vitamin D, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and rituximab. Follow-up for 2 years showed no disease relapse, and no medications required.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】RDD is identified by infiltrating, pale, eosinophilic histiocytes that are S100-positive, CD68-positive and CD1a-negative. Although Rosai and Dorfman initially described this disorder in young Africans, it has been reported globally in individuals of all races. The etiology remains uncertain; nevertheless, the coexistence of autoimmune antibodies during disease activity, coupled with numerous reports providing serological evidence of recent bacterial or viral infections, particularly herpes viruses, suggests a potential association with immune dysregulation secondary to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Painless, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy is the most common presentation, with an average age of onset in the second decade. Fever, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hypergammaglobulinemia are some of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities that may be present.\n\n【21】RDD can be confused with other histiocytosis, both benign and malignant. However, the unique features of RDD, such as the presence of emperipolesis, the immunocytochemical profile and absence of cellular atypia, along with clinical and laboratory findings, can help distinguish it from other potential diagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Extra-nodal sites are involved along with lymph nodes in 43% of RDD cases. In 23% of cases isolated extra-nodal RDD occurs, with peripheral lymphadenopathy being the most frequent manifestation.\n\n【23】Extra-nodal RDD affects the skin, soft tissue, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and skeletal system. The severity of joint disease varied from mild polyarthralgia to disabling arthritis. RDD has been linked to autoimmune phenomena, with hematologic autoantibodies against red cell antigens being most commonly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】But acute life-threatening autoimmune hemolytic anemia complicating RDD is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】RDD management varies, and in some cases, like the one with our patient, steroids alone may suffice. However, in refractory cases, chemotherapeutic agents and blood transfusion may be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Multi-organ involvement and immune dysfunction are negative prognostic factors and necessitate treatment. Glucocorticoids and chemotherapy have been used with reported success in some cases where other cases had spontaneous resolution. Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine are commonly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion, early and appropriate management are crucial to achieving full recovery in RDD patients. Therefore, raising awareness of RDD among healthcare professionals is needed, leading to prompt diagnosis and appropriate management.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the patient who participated in this case report and allowed us to share their medical information.

We report a case of 61-year-old female who presented with deteriorating renal function. Initial laboratory investigations were negative for autoimmune antibodies including negative anti-neutrophilic cytoplasm antibodies and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence. However, renal biopsy was positive for linear IgG staining. Despite starting plasmapheresis and corticosteroids treatment, her renal functions continued to deteriorate and she was started on regular hemodialysis. This case highlights the challenging presentation and diagnosis of anti-GBM disease, which requires a high clinical suspicion necessarily for early diagnosis and treatment to improve survival rates.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】A 61-year-old female presented with complaints of fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, hemoptysis and intermittent hematuria for 1 month. Vitals signs were unremarkable. Chest examination revealed decreased air entry with basal crackles and abdomen was distended and positive for ascites with 1+ pitting edema. Investigations showed elevated creatinine at 6.7 (Ref: 0.5–1.1 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen of 61 (Ref: 6–20 mg/dl), normal liver function tests with albumin of 3.4 (Ref: 3.4–4.8 g/dl) and negative hepatitis panel (A–C). Urinalysis showed 4+ protein, 3+ blood with no nitrite/leukocyte esterase. Bence Jones Protein was negative by electrophoresis. She also had negative antinuclear antibodies, ant-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p- and c-ANCA), anti-double stranded DNA and normal total complement (C3 and C4), which were reported within 2 days of admission. Her anti-GBM was negative using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence and was performed twice, 2 weeks apart (results were available on days 3 and 18 from admission, respectively). She underwent renal biopsy on day 4 of admission and the result was positive for crescentic glomerulonephritis with segmental scars and fibrous crescents (reported on day 19). Immunofluorescence was positive for linear IgG staining, which is consistent with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis . She was started on plasmapheresis and corticosteroids on day 21 of admission. However, no significant improvement of her symptoms, serum creatinine or urine output was achieved after six cycles of plasmapheresis and, therefore, she was started on hemodialysis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Glomerulus with a fibrocellular cresent (A) and immunofluorescence showing linear pattern IgG (B).</u>\n\n【5】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【6】Goodpasture’s disease, first described by Ernest Goodpasture in 1919 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, is rare autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies mostly directed against the alpha3 chain of type IV non-collagenous domain in the lung and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Because one problem triggers a series of events that lead to further indications and symptoms, PRS is not regarded as a syndrome in and of itself but rather as a series of conditions.

He had agnathia, glossoptosis and cleft palate. The patient was a preterm child born by normal delivery at 34 weeks of gestation to a middle-class family of south Asian ethnicity. Upon admission, he developed cyanosis with an arterial saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 90% and a venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 77.8 mmHg. He had a 0.2-cm mouth opening and hence laryngoscopy was not possible. His saturation was improved to 95% by oxygen with a facial mask. The same night he deteriorated to an SpO2 of 80%. Next, we tried blind nasal intubation with an ETT loaded with stylet, which failed. Then, we tried Size 1 laryngeal mask airway (Well Lead Medical, China) which failed as well. His respiratory distress was improved after we placed an NPA and saturation returned to 100%.\n\n【8】He was planned for correction of the mandible with mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) under general anaesthesia. After giving oxymetazoline nasal drops to dry his secretion, we slowed dialled sevoflurane to 6% and then back to 3% to maintain his spontaneous breathing. Fibreoptic scope (Olympus, Japan) revealed the epiglottis lying on the posterior pharynx, which could not be manoeuvred. Due to repeated attempts, the patient developed laryngospasm, and his (SpO2) was reduced to 70%. Anaesthetic depth was increased with sevoflurane and SpO2 improved to 94%. Once laryngospasm settled, a 2.8-mm outer diameter video ureteroscope was introduced through the nasal cavity. Glottis was visualized but the ETT could not be negotiated into the trachea. Following jaw thrust and slight pulling of the tongue with Magill’s Forceps, a 150-cm long and 0.035-inch diameter atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic polyurethane-coated (PC) guidewire was introduced through the working channel of the video ureteroscope into the trachea under the vision  and a 3.5-mm ID ETT was railroaded over it and a definitive airway was established. Once the airway was secured, the patient had an MDO procedure and no adverse events were encountered. He was sent back to neonatal ICU and successfully extubated there on post-operative day 5. Presently, the child is doing fine and only requires minimal oxygen support with nasal prongs.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Infants with PRS may exhibit stridor, chest retraction, sleep apnoea, cyanosis and respiratory insufficiency along with different degrees of upper airway blockage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, 25–45% of new-borns with PRS exhibit feeding and swallowing issues, which may be connected to respiratory conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. During laryngoscopy and intubation, the Pierre Robin Syndrome presents significant difficulty for anaesthesiologists, making oxygenation and ventilation challenging. The airway structure of PRS new-borns makes them one of the most challenging cases to intubate. The anaesthesiologist uses a variety of tools, including the Ambuscope, fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) and video laryngoscopes, in difficult airway management situations.\n\n【11】We describe the novel use of a video ureteroscope (Olympus URF-V2) as an airway endoscope. In urology, kidney stones are typically removed with a video ureteroscope. It has a wider field of vision and is longer than a FOB. Currently, sizes with an outside diameter of only 1.8 mm are accessible. In contrast to a FOB, which only offers an angulation of 160° up and 90°, it offers 275° of up- and downangulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. There is little research on video ureteroscopes for airway endoscopy, and there are few sporadic case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. With a distal tip diameter ranging from 5.3 to 8.7 Fr, flexible ureteroscopes are currently offered in a variety of sizes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We used a 2.8-mm (8.4 Fr) video ureteroscope with a working channel of 1.2 mm to pass the atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic PC guidewire into the trachea. These guidewires used through a working channel of the ureteroscope are coated with a hydrophilic polymer like polytetrafluoroethylene and have a distal atraumatic tip useful for negotiating difficult ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool in the armoury of an anaesthesiologist. At our institute, which is a tertiary care centre, we are now training and utilising video-ureteroscope as an airway endoscope. We have already made use of this vital instrument in several other cases like removal of foreign body, difficult airway management in severe temporomandibular joint ankylosis and also in some cases of one lung ventilation for checking the correct placement of Double lumen tube. Through this case report, we want to highlight the importance of this novel method of airway management which can go a long way in developing new strategies for difficult airway management in the times to come. The legal designate consent has been taken from the father of the child.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】We conclude that a flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool for difficult airway management.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A.B. was responsible for the conception and design of the work; R.G. did the analysis of review of literature; S.T. drafted the work and compared our analysis with previous literature on the case.

Flagellate patterns of eruption have also been noted in drug reactions particularly to bleomycin, peplomycin (a bleomycin derivative), docetaxel, adult-onset Still’s disease, and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> **.**\n\n【14】The patient was put on a mid-potency topical steroid (Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment applied to affected areas twice daily). The rash resolved within 1 week. It has been reported that shiitake dermatitis can also resolve spontaneously.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Shiitake dermatitis is a unique condition that is primarily characterized by the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions that it leaves on the extremities and trunks of patients. The first report of this dermatitis was in 1977 in Japan. Nakamura had observed that the ingestion of uncooked or under cooked shiitake mushrooms ( _Lentinula edodes_ ) was causing these peculiar skin eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> **.** There have since been many more cases reported not only in Asia, but in Europe and the Western Hemisphere as well. It is expected that as the popularity of shiitake mushrooms continues to grow there will be more cases of shiitake dermatitis reported.\n\n【17】There is little known about underlaying pathophysiology. In many cases reported there is often a delay of 24–72 hours between the consumption of the mushrooms and when the eruptions become noticeable, but the possibility of seeing eruptions sooner than that has been reported. In one case reported eruptions started only 5 hours after consuming raw shiitake mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> **.** Lentinan, a polysaccharide that is found in shiitake mushrooms is believed to play a role in causing the eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> **.** Whether it is a toxic reaction or a late hypersensitivity reaction, once ingested the polysaccharide will elicit the secretion of interleukin-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> **.** This cytokine promotes an inflammatory response in the body that results in the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions. Heat favors this theory because when fully cooked shiitake mushrooms are consumed no dermatitis is visible. The heat that is used when cooking the mushrooms denatures the lentinan making it nonfunctional.\n\n【18】Bleomycin a drug used in many cancer therapies also could induce flagellate dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically it may appear that bleomycin and shiitake mushrooms cause the same cutaneous effects, but a major distinguishing characteristic that is seen in bleomycin induced flagellate dermatitis is the visible hyperpigmentation that occurs at the site of the eruptions.\n\n【19】Typically, treatment options for shiitake dermatitis also known as flagellate dermatitis are similar; clinicians can prescribe oral antihistamines and/or topical corticosteroids to help reduce the inflammatory response. As to the duration of the cutaneous eruptions when the dermatitis is caused by the consumption of shiitake mushrooms, most eruptions will clear up within days. Simple avoidance is also important in the prevention of further eruptions. With regards to bleomycin in most cases patients must change their cancer therapy regimen or wait until their regimen is completed before the eruptions begin to resolve. Even after completion it can take several weeks to months for the eruptions to clear up.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hubert Huho Chavez, with HubLab LLC for researching trends in Mushroom consumption in the world and specifically in the United States and reviewing and editing the manuscript and photos.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Signed by patient.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:21", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:29", "cost": 7.885}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:20"}

Staphylococci and streptococci are the most common causative agents of infective endocarditis, with _Streptococcus gordonii_ being a rare cause. We present a case of infective endocarditis in a young patient who presented with an acute abdomen 2 months after being diagnosed with cerebrovascular accident. An abdominal computed tomography revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, and infarct in the right kidney and spleen as a result of systemic septic embolism. Echocardiography showed numerous vegetations at the aortic and mitral valves. Infective endocarditis was diagnosed based on echocardiographic findings and positive blood cultures for _S. gordonii_ . He was treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin and was also referred for surgical intervention.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Infective endocarditis is a potentially fatal condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Among the most common complications of infective endocarditis were heart failure, periannular abscess, systemic embolization, mycotic aneurysm and neurological complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Streptococci are the second most common cause of infective endocarditis after staphylococci. The viridans group streptococci (VGS) were found to be responsible for one-third of all streptococcal infective endocarditis cases, with _S. mitis_ group streptococci being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_S. gordonii_ infection can cause infective endocarditis, septic arthritis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of _Streptococcus gordonii_ infective endocarditis complicated by systemic embolization to multiple sites.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 28-year-old Bangladeshi man with no prior medical history initially presented with right-sided body weakness, and a brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed left middle cerebral artery infarct. Due to financial constraints, he was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 150 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. Two months later, he presented to our hospital with 3 days of generalized, colicky abdominal pain and 1 week of fever. He had no diarrhea, vomiting, recent abdominal trauma or surgical history.\n\n【8】His initial vital parameters revealed a blood pressure of 119/50 mm Hg and a temperature of 38.2°C. He was also tachycardic but saturating well in ambient air. On general examination, there was a collapsing pulse and finger clubbing, but no other signs of infective endocarditis. An oral examination revealed dental plaques but no caries. A thorough cardiovascular examination revealed the presence of an early diastolic murmur over the Erb’s point and a pansystolic murmur over the apical region radiating to the left axillary area. There were no signs of heart failure. A neurological examination revealed residual weakness in the right upper and lower limbs, with power of 4/5 compared to the left side. An abdominal examination revealed generalized tenderness throughout the abdomen, with the umbilical region being the most tender.\n\n【9】The initial full blood count revealed a white cell count of 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin of 8 g/dl, and normal platelet counts. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The chest and abdominal radiographs were normal. The patient was referred to the surgical team for an acute abdomen with a provisional diagnosis of perforated appendix. As a result, an urgent abdominal CT was performed, which revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis as well as right renal and splenic hypodense lesions, indicating infarction from septic emboli . There were no signs of a perforated appendix.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography of the abdomen showing (a) thrombosis at the distal part of the superior mesenteric artery, (b) a wedge-shaped hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen, (c) a hypodense lesion in the midpole of the right kidney.</u>\n\n【11】An urgent echocardiography was scheduled due to the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. The ejection fraction was normal, with severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation and a bicuspid aortic valve as an incidental finding. Vegetations were discovered at the tips of the anterior and posterior aortic valves, measuring 1.1 cm × 0.6 cm and 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm, respectively. Another vegetation was discovered at the body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring 0.5 cm × 0.8 cm .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Echocardiography showing vegetations at the aortic and mitral valves (anterior aortic valve = yellow arrow; posterior aortic valve = blue arrow; anterior mitral valve leaflet = green arrow).</u>\n\n【13】He was diagnosed with infective endocarditis, which was complicated by septic embolization to multiple sites, including the brain, mesentery, kidney and spleen. Three sets of blood cultures were taken from three different sites at different times, and he was started on empirical antimicrobial treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. His condition improved after antibiotics, as his fever and abdominal pain subsided.\n\n【14】After two days of incubation, _S. gordonii_ was isolated from all blood cultures using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry method . The isolate was susceptible to penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.016 microgram/ml. He received benzylpenicillin 3 MU intravenously every 4 hours for a total of 6 weeks. He was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for surgical intervention due to the high risk of further septic embolization from multiple vegetations, the large size of vegetation (>1 cm), and previous systemic embolism. The patient was planned for surgical excision of the vegetations and valve reconstruction. He, however, decided to return to his home country for further treatment and valve surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Gram stain of the blood culture showing gram-positive cocci grouped in chains.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】VGS are catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci arranged in chains on microscopic examination. The VGS can be classified into six major groups, namely _Streptococcus anginosus_ group, _S. mitis_ group, _S. sanguinis_ group, _S. bovis_ group, _Streptococcus salivarius_ group, and _S. mutans_ group. The _S. sanguinis_ group is further divided into _S. sanguinis_ , _Streptococcus parasanguinis_ , and _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】_S. gordonii_ colonizes oral biofilms on tooth surfaces and is involved in the formation of dental plaques. Bacteria can be released from oral biofilms and enter the bloodstream via tooth brushing, tooth extraction or oral trauma, resulting in systemic infection. _S. gordonii_ bacteremia can cause platelet aggregation and hyperinflammatory state, which contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had no recent dental procedures. Nonetheless, dental plaques were discovered during a physical examination, which could be the source of _S. gordonii_ .\n\n【19】_S. gordonii_ is a rare causative agent of infective endocarditis. Mosailova _et al._ reported a 31-year-old man with mitral valve infective endocarditis caused by _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Besides that, Komorovsky _et al._ reported a case of _S. gordonii_ \\-related infective endocarditis in an 11-year-old girl with Barlow’s mitral valve disease in which _S. gordonii_ was cultured from the resected vegetation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Systemic embolism is a devastating and potentially fatal complication of infective endocarditis that occurs in up to 50% of cases. In patients with infective endocarditis, this is usually caused by fragmentation of vegetation or cardiac tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Millaire _et al._ reported that nearly half of patients with infective endocarditis developed systemic embolic complications, with the central nervous system being the most common, followed by the spleen, kidney, lung, liver, bone and joint, iliac artery, and mesenteric artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Infective endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-susceptible VGS, including _S. gordonii_ , can be treated with parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone. Gentamicin should be added for the first 2 weeks of penicillin treatment in patients with relatively penicillin-resistant VGS infective endocarditis. Early surgical intervention, in addition to targeted antimicrobial therapy, has been shown to reduce mortality and embolic events by lowering the risk of systemic embolism in patients with large vegetations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In conclusion, infective endocarditis should be considered in young patients who have stroke-like symptoms. _S. gordonii_ is a rare cause of infective endocarditis and is associated with dental plaques. Multiple, large-sized vegetations can predispose to systemic emboli, which must be treated promptly with antimicrobial therapy and early surgical intervention.\n\n【23】*   Abbreviations\n\n【24】*   VGS—Viridans group streptococci\n\n【25】*   CT—computed tomography\n\n【26】*   MALDI-TOF—matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight\n\n【27】*   MIC—minimum inhibitory concentration\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Edmund LC Ong is the guarantor.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.

These mutations may also exist in Syria as it neighbors Lebanon, and they both share a common background.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 17-year-old male came with swollen left knee and forefinger. He previously had diagnosed with multiple cold abscesses. The child has consanguineous parents as they were first cousins. The patient also had itchy eczematous and desquamating eruptions on the trunk and scalp around the age of six months. Atopic dermatitis was subsequently diagnosed and managed conservatively. By the age of two, the patient had a pea-sized lateral abscess in the neck that reached the size of a golf ball in one year. It was managed by antibiotics and drainage with culture yielding _Staphylococcus aureus_ . Afterwards around the age of five, an abscess was formed on the scalp behind the ear, which was also caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ . By the age of six, an abscess was formed on the skin on the right parotid gland. By the age of ten, an abscess was formed in the groin extending to the right scrotum. Around the age of 12, an abscess that grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ was formed on the lateral side of the left thigh, and the knee was also swollen. Finally by the age of 14, the patient had a swollen left forefinger. The histopathology revealed a xanthoma in the scalp and xanthogranuloma with abscess formation in the salivary gland with no malignant or tuberculosis features. The patient declared that he had normal teeth development and no ophthalmological symptoms. No history of pneumonia was noted. Family history was also insignificant.\n\n【8】On examination, the current swelling on the knee and forefinger were solid, non-tender and not warm to touch . The patient had minor desquamating and peeling skin over the soles and palms. No scoliosis was noted, but the patient had a distinguished facies . He had a broad nasal bridge, a depressive asymmetric face, a mild prognathism and coarse features. He was in a good general condition and had a good appetite. However, the patient was pale and had a short stature (147 cm), which was nearly four standard deviations (SD) below the mean height of his parents with no signs of puberty (Tanner I). No oral thrush was noted, and teeth examination was normal. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepato-splenomegaly.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|It demonstrates the lesions on the knee and finger and the multiple scars on the abdomen.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|It demonstrates the distinguished facies of the child.</u>\n\n【11】The patient had normal WBCs count, platelet count, electrolytes, urine analysis and lipid profile, but eosinophil count was 541 cells/mcl, he had microcytic anemia Hb (6.4 g/dl) and MCV was (54 fl). Blood film showed hypochromic microcytic red blood cells, and an increased eosinophil count (10%). Hemoglobin electrophoresis and tuberculosis Mantoux test were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a high gamma protein level, with low alpha 1 and albumin levels, and a total complement protein level (ch50) of 59 U/ml ( _n_ \\> 23), IgE: 2780 IU/ml ( _N_ < 100), IgG: 2773 ( _N_ : 700–1600), IgM: 184 ( _N_ : 40–230). Chest X-ray was normal. Knee and finger X-rays revealed an enlargement of soft tissue with intact bones . Knee MRI showed a subcutaneous loculated effusion, and hematomas in the sub- and supra-patellar and the popliteal fossa. MRI of the head was normal with a normal pituitary stalk and no thickening. MRI of the neck  demonstrated an elliptical segmented lesion with thick walls in the right parapharyngeal space that measured 5 × 6 × 8 cm, which was suggestive of an abscess.

The patient was discharged and was given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as prophylaxis against staphylococcus, but follow-ups could not be attended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】HIES consists of multiple overlapping primary immunodeficiency conditions, each of which has its distinct features. The most common defects are a deficiency of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and a deficiency of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Genetic testing is considered the golden standard for STAT3-deficient HIES while Th17 cells testing can be used for a probable HIES, and a scoring system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> is used for a probable STAT3 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The patient got 10 points for the IgE level, 8 for the number of abscesses, 3 for the eosinophil count, 5 for the congenital anomalies, 4 for the congenital rash, 2 for the eczema and 1 for the wide nose. In total, the patient got 33. We can also add one point for the confirmed pneumonia.\n\n【23】Diagnosis can be problematic as there is no clear criteria and symptoms are quite diverse similar to our case. However, most clinicians diagnose HIES with its clinical features, and the scoring system is used to evaluate for STAT3 probability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We could not identify the mutations due to the unavailable genetic testing for HIES in Syria and the financial disadvantage, which affected many other cases and have delayed diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The most common locations for cold abscesses are the face and the trunk. Pulmonary complications exist in 77% of cases, which were absent in our case. Patients can have distinctive coarse facies features that become universal by 16 years of age, including asymmetrical faces, hemitrophy, prominent foreheads, broad nasal bridges, mild prognathism and deep-set eyes  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Scoliosis can also occur in 63% of cases, and all patients have some degree of eczema. Prophylactic antibiotics against staphylococcus can be used such as TMP-SMX as reoccurrence is not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, as HIES was not diagnosed the patient did not take staphylococcus prophylaxis in previous visits.\n\n【25】In one study on Lebanese participants with HIES, two sporadic mutation carriers were of consanguineous parents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is similar to our patient who had consanguineous parents with no history of HIES in the family. Our patient also had arthropathy of the knee, hematomas and a cold abscess in the parapharyngeal space, which are different from the Lebanese patients. Moreover, the patient had unexplainable xanthoma and hematomas, which are atypical for HIES.\n\n【26】The eczema in HIES is difficult to be distinguished from atopic dermatitis. However, a long course from early life with atypical distribution such as in the axilla and groin, recurrent staphylococcus infections with cold abscesses and resistant to conventional treatment are signs of HIES dermatitis rather than atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our case had peeling skin over the soles and palms and was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis in infancy. One of the most important differential diagnosis for xanthomas is Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which can present with consistent eczema, and unexplained skin lesions. However, histology and immunophenotyping were not suggestive in our case. Our patient did not have pituitary manifestations, stalk thickening or diabetes insipidus, which can be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Other differential diagnoses include aspergillosis, and other immune deficiencies such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS). WAS is an immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections and high IgE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient had recurrent cold staphylococcus abscesses and did not have the other features of WAS, which made the diagnosis highly unlikely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion, HIES is a rare disease that is understudied and underdiagnosed in Syria although there is a high potential for novel mutations in the region. Despite our case having many typical HIES features, xanthoma and knee hematomas were unique. This study provides an insight into HIES for physicians in the region and encourages future work on the matter.\n\n【28】DECLARATIONS\n------------\n\n【29】### ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n\n【30】Informed consent was taken for this research.

The patient was discharged and was given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as prophylaxis against staphylococcus, but follow-ups could not be attended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】HIES consists of multiple overlapping primary immunodeficiency conditions, each of which has its distinct features. The most common defects are a deficiency of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and a deficiency of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Genetic testing is considered the golden standard for STAT3-deficient HIES while Th17 cells testing can be used for a probable HIES, and a scoring system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> is used for a probable STAT3 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The patient got 10 points for the IgE level, 8 for the number of abscesses, 3 for the eosinophil count, 5 for the congenital anomalies, 4 for the congenital rash, 2 for the eczema and 1 for the wide nose. In total, the patient got 33. We can also add one point for the confirmed pneumonia.\n\n【23】Diagnosis can be problematic as there is no clear criteria and symptoms are quite diverse similar to our case. However, most clinicians diagnose HIES with its clinical features, and the scoring system is used to evaluate for STAT3 probability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We could not identify the mutations due to the unavailable genetic testing for HIES in Syria and the financial disadvantage, which affected many other cases and have delayed diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The most common locations for cold abscesses are the face and the trunk. Pulmonary complications exist in 77% of cases, which were absent in our case. Patients can have distinctive coarse facies features that become universal by 16 years of age, including asymmetrical faces, hemitrophy, prominent foreheads, broad nasal bridges, mild prognathism and deep-set eyes  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Scoliosis can also occur in 63% of cases, and all patients have some degree of eczema. Prophylactic antibiotics against staphylococcus can be used such as TMP-SMX as reoccurrence is not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, as HIES was not diagnosed the patient did not take staphylococcus prophylaxis in previous visits.\n\n【25】In one study on Lebanese participants with HIES, two sporadic mutation carriers were of consanguineous parents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is similar to our patient who had consanguineous parents with no history of HIES in the family. Our patient also had arthropathy of the knee, hematomas and a cold abscess in the parapharyngeal space, which are different from the Lebanese patients. Moreover, the patient had unexplainable xanthoma and hematomas, which are atypical for HIES.\n\n【26】The eczema in HIES is difficult to be distinguished from atopic dermatitis. However, a long course from early life with atypical distribution such as in the axilla and groin, recurrent staphylococcus infections with cold abscesses and resistant to conventional treatment are signs of HIES dermatitis rather than atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our case had peeling skin over the soles and palms and was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis in infancy. One of the most important differential diagnosis for xanthomas is Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which can present with consistent eczema, and unexplained skin lesions. However, histology and immunophenotyping were not suggestive in our case. Our patient did not have pituitary manifestations, stalk thickening or diabetes insipidus, which can be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Other differential diagnoses include aspergillosis, and other immune deficiencies such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS). WAS is an immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections and high IgE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient had recurrent cold staphylococcus abscesses and did not have the other features of WAS, which made the diagnosis highly unlikely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion, HIES is a rare disease that is understudied and underdiagnosed in Syria although there is a high potential for novel mutations in the region. Despite our case having many typical HIES features, xanthoma and knee hematomas were unique. This study provides an insight into HIES for physicians in the region and encourages future work on the matter.\n\n【28】DECLARATIONS\n------------\n\n【29】### ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n\n【30】Informed consent was taken for this research.

To date only two cases are reported in the literature in children aged <18 years. Here we are reporting a case of a 4-year-old boy who has Chylothorax and chylous ascites due to peritoneal tuberculosis which is complicated by medullary nephrocalcinosis and improved after antitubercular therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The concurrent occurrence of both chylothorax and chylous ascites (CA) associated with tuberculosis (TB) is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Morton first described CA in a 2-year-old boy with disseminated TB in 1694 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The etiology of chylothorax and CA can be classified into three broad categories, non-traumatic (congenital, infectious, neoplastic, cirrhotic or cardiogenic), traumatic (postoperative, blunt trauma to the chest or thoracic spine, penetrating injuries of the chest) and idiopathic. Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system and trauma are common causes in children. Infectious disease including TB account for the majority of cases in developing countries like our country 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】A CASE REPORT\n-------------\n\n【5】A 4-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with the complaint of progressive abdominal distention and growth retardation which began at the age of one. He referred to several doctors without being able to give the right diagnosis. There was no history of fever, cough, or contact with TB patients. He had received his regular vaccines. On physical examination, his body weight was 19 kg (+2.3DS), height was 93 cm (−2.1DS), body temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, abdominal girth was 74 cm, non pitting lower extremities edema, pulse rate of 90/min, respiratory rate of 25braethe/minute and there was decrease in breathe sounds and dullness to percussion in the left lower lung field. Oxygen saturation was normal. There was bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) on his left shoulder. Abdomen was extremely distended. Shifting dullness and fluid wave were present. We could not evaluate organomegaly because of ascites. His other systems were normal.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigation reports were as follows: hemoglobin (HB) 11.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 16 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> (neutrophils 76%), platelets 712 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , C-reactive protein (CRP) was normal, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 30 mm at the end of first hour, amylase 36 U/L (normal 40-140), cholesterol 119 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL, total protein 4.4 g/dL, albumin 2 g/dL, IgE 7.3 IU/mL (normal). Other liver function tests, kidney function tests and electrolytes were normal.\n\n【7】Urinalysis showed calcium oxalate (++). Culture and sensitivity were normal. Peripheral blood smear was normal. Chest and plain abdominal films showed left pleural effusion, diffuse abdominal haziness, elevation of the diaphragm, bulging of the flanks and fluid accumulation . Tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed massive amount of fluid in the abdomen, left pleural effusion (750 mL), deposits within kidney caliculi, portal vein, supraliver veins and liver artery were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Chest and plain abdominal films showing left pleural effusion, diffuse abdominal haziness, elevation of the diaphragm, bulging of the flanks and fluid accumulation.</u>\n\n【9】During investigations for the ascites etiology, the echocardiography was normal and the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no specific signs except follicular duodenitis and the biopsies result were chronic duodenitis without villous atrophy (Marsh score 0). Analysis of the ascitic fluid revealed milky white in color, with white cell of 160 mm <sup>3 </sup> (lymphocytes dominate), total protein 0.7 g/dL, albumin 0.2 g/dL, LDH 114 U/L, cholesterol 48 mg/dL, triglyceride 828 mg/dL (high), amylase 10 U/L, glucose 128 mg/dL. Serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.8 indicating a transudative ascites. Culture of fluid was sterile and cytological examination was negative for malignant cells. Stain for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Pleurocentesis revealed grossly milky fluid with high level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) 47.5 U/L (normal 0–40), highly suggestive of a peritoneal TB.\n\n【10】Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed evidence of moderate left pleural effusion, massive fluid accumulation in peritoneal cavities and medullary nephrocalcinosis signs .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|CT chest, abdomen and pelvis showing accumulation of fluid in the pelvis and the whole abdominal cavity, medullary nephrocalcinosis in the right kidney.</u>\n\n【12】Work up for cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis including the serum calcium 7.3 mg/dL (low), serum phosphorus 3.7 mg/dL, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 4.9 ng/mL (low), parathyroid hormone (PTH) was normal, arterial blood gas test was normal and a 24-h urine accumulation was as follows: total size 750 mL, protein 85 mg, creatinine 22 mg, calcium 300 mg. A 24-h urinary excretion of calcium was 15.7 mg/kg (more than 4 mg/kg) indicating a hypercalciuria.\n\n【13】For control of ascites, the patient was initiated on medium chain triglyceride (MCT-based diet). Antitubercular therapy was started with regimen containing isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. Abdominal distention and ascites fluid resolved gradually with time. Abdominal ultrasound after 2 weeks revealed resolution of ascites. He had started on hydrochlorothiazide for hypercalciuria. He responded well to the treatment and hypercalciuria was resolved. His physical examination and general condition were stable after he finished antituberculosis therapy. Laboratory evaluation was normal and has been uptill now.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Peritoneal TB (TBP) accounts for ~0.1–0.7% of all cases of TB and 通用删除7(英):<u>(25–60)</u>% of abdominal TB cases. It is seen most commonly in patients between 25 and 55 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In children it is seen with a lower frequency. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB in children represented 11% of total TB cases and the prevalence was 0.38 (0.35–0.41) per 100 000 in pediatric group in Syria, a developing country, 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The literature regarding mycobacterial infection related chylothorax and CA has been published primarily in the form of case reports. Only two cases are reported in children. Kim _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> incubated tuberculosis bacilli in sputum and pleural fluid of a 17-year-old female patient with diffuse nodular opacities in her pulmonary parenchyma multiple necrotic abdominal lymphadenopathies, chylothorax and CA. Rabie _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> also reported a 3-year-old boy who had paradoxical tuberculosis associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome complicated by chyloperitoneum and secondary chylothorax.\n\n【17】The clinical presentation of CA is characterized by progressive and painless abdominal distension, weight gain, sign of malnutrition along with symptoms, and signs of underlying conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In children with tuberculosis, chylothorax is the result of lymph node compression or erosion of the thoracic duct, often identified on computerized tomography of the chest. The development of chylothorax in the absence enlarged chest lymph nodes or constrictive pericarditis in our case suggest that the chylothorax was secondary to the transdiaphragmatic movement of CA. This shunting across the diaphragm is a well described as a cause for chylothorax, possibly due to defects in the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Small chylothorax can be asymptomatic and is detected incidentally. A patient with large chylothorax usually presents with signs and symptoms caused by the mechanical effect of compression on lung expansion (breathlessness, dyspnea, chest pressure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Paracentesis is the most important test in diagnosing chylothorax and CA. Chyle presents as a milky, cloudy and turbid liquid, this should be distinguished from pseudochylous ascites, in which the turbid appearance is due to cellular degeneration from infection or malignancy without actually containing high levels of triglycerides. Diagnostic triglyceride values are typically above 200 mg/dL, although some authors use a cutoff value of 110 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Analysis of ascetic fluid often shows exudative features with lymphocytic predominance and SAAG lesser than 1.1 g/dL but a falsely high value of SAAG may occur in CA as lipid fractions tend to interfere with laboratory determination of albumin as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】ADA values in peritoneal and pleural fluid can be used as a support marker for tuberculous effusion. Some studies have reported a high sensitivity, up to 100%, and a specificity of 97% using cutoff values of 36–40 IU/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Acid-fast smear of ascitic fluid has a low yield with a reported sensitivity of 0–6%, while the frequency of a positive culture for _M. tuberculosis_ was 2–50%. A positive TST has been reported in 24–100% of the cases; this test is diagnostically insignificant, as negative skin test may be seen in many patients with histologically confirmed TBP. Peritoneal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In our patient AFB, TST and culture of peritoneal fluid were negative. PCR was not available in the hospital and his parents refused to perform peritoneal biopsy. There was no pulmonary involvement according to chest radiographies. The patient’s parents denied any history of trauma. Constrictive pericarditis, as a possible cause of chylothorax and CA, was not noted on the result of echocardiography. Typical appearance of CA, chylothorax and medullary nephrocalcinosis established diagnosis of TBP. High ADA concentration in the pleural fluid provides supportive information for a clinical diagnosis. Nephrocalcinosis is a disorder in which there is too much calcium deposited in the kidneys. Any disorder that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine may lead to nephrocalcinosis. The condition that causes medullary nephrocalcinosis in our case includes tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The patient had started on tuberculosis therapy and MCT-based diet for chylothorax and CA. He was initiated on hydrochlorothiazide for hypercalciuria.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained patient’s parents informed consent for the presentation of this case.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Lava Mohammad, Department of pediatrics, Tishreen university hospital, Lattakia, Syria.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:07:52", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:08:10", "cost": 17.84}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:08:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:07:52"}

The urine in PUBS gets its color from the combination of two pigments, indirubin and indigo, which are breakdown products of tryptophan. The most important risk factors include long-term catheterization, female gender, chronic constipation, old age and being bed bound. Here, we present a case of PUBS in an elderly female with a history of bladder cancer that needed catheterization along with constipation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare complication of urinary tract infection (UTI) with prevalence ranging between 8.3 and 42.1% among patients with long-term indwelling catheters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The urine entering the catheter is normal in color, yet purple discoloration soon appears. This is due to the development of indigo (blue in color) and indirubin (red in color) by the presence of urinary bacteria. These pigments interact with the plastic material of the catheter bag and tubing to produce the purple discoloration by producing a coating layer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although it is benign in nature and only changes occur in the color of urine from yellow to purple, PUBS results in greater anxiety in patients.\n\n【4】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【5】A 76-year-old female with medical history significant for congestive Stage III chronic kidney disease and bladder cancer presented to the hospital with shortness of breath from congestive heart failure exacerbation. Further investigation revealed an acute kidney injury secondary to cardiorenal syndrome and kidney ultrasound showed mild-to-moderate right-sided hydronephrosis from invasive bladder cancer. A Foley catheter was placed to relieve obstruction and she was placed on intravenous furosemide for congestive heart failure exacerbation. In addition, the patient has been constipated since admission and after 4 days, a change in the urine color was noted in the Foley bag . Urine dipstick analysis showed alkaline urine (pH of 8.5) with a large amount of blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase and proteins. Urine culture revealed >100 000 CFU/ml of _Proteus mirabilis_ . Computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis revealed constipation with stercoral colitis and moderate right-sided hydronephrosis with a thickened bladder wall but no stones. The patient was started on a course of ceftriaxone 1 g daily and miralax/senna twice daily with lactulose as needed for constipation. Based upon the patient’s history and the microbiology results, a diagnosis of PUBS was made. Her constipation resolved, and a 5-day course of antibiotics was completed. The patient was discharged to a nursing facility with recommendations to follow up with her nephrologist and urologist as an outpatient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Dark purple urine in the Foley catheter bag. Patient’s urine turned a dark shade of purple after she was constipated for 4 days.</u>\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】PUBS was first reported in 1978 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is an uncommon phenomenon and most commonly seen in patients with permanent urinary catheterization in combination with a highly alkaline UTI (about 9.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Numerous organisms have been reported as being responsible for purple urine bag and include _Providencia stuartii_ , _Providencia rettgeri_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Proteus species_ , _Escherichia coli_ , _Enterococcus species_ , _Morganella morganii_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of this phenomenon can be traced back to the catabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found only in our diet which aids in the production of proteins, enzymes and other components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. With the help of bacteria, tryptophan is broken down in the gut into indole where it is then taken to the liver and turned into indoxyl sulfate. Sulfatase-producing bacteria in the urinary tract convert indoxyl sulfate into indoxyl which, when metabolized in an alkaline environment, gives rise to indirubin (red pigment) and indigo (blue pigment). When these pigments are combined and oxidized, the urine becomes purple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Gastrointestinal conditions such as obstruction, intussusception and ileal diversions can also increase PUBS, presumably because the bacteria are allowed more time to grow and deaminate tryptophan as in constipated patients. Elderly and bedridden patients with multiple comorbidities more often require long-term indwelling catheters which increase their risk of UTIs; such patients are more likely to be infected by the rarer bacteria which can go on to cause PUBS 通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>.

Here, we report a case of a 64-year-old male who was hospitalized because of recurrent effort-related syncope events. Physical examination revealed several characteristic clinical clues for subclavian steal syndrome. Indeed, through the use of multimodality imaging, the diagnosis was established. We demonstrate that the combination of history taking, thorough physical exam and subsequent imaging studies can establish a relatively rare diagnosis of recurrent syncope.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】When the proximal section of the subclavian artery becomes stenotic, blood supply to the ipsilateral arm may become impaired. Rarely, in the face of growing flow demand, blood flow through the posterior circulation may reverse as a compensatory mechanism, resulting in diminished cerebral blood flow, which may be manifested as episodes vertigo and/or syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Commonly, atherosclerosis is the primary condition that begins this cascade of events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 64-year-old male suffered from recurrent episodes of dizziness and three syncope events. All three episodes were preceded by physical effort which involved the upper extremities. No chest pain, palpitations or cough spells prior to the occurrence of syncope were reported. His past medical history included diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and active cigarette smoking, without a previous history ischemic heart disease, arrythmias, previous peripheral vascular interventions nor a diagnosis of chronic lung disease. Due to his complaints, he was initially seen by his family medical doctor, where low blood pressures were recorded (90/60 mm Hg). Following a third episode of syncope he was referred to the hospital and subsequently admitted to the department of cardiovascular medicine for further workup. Upon examination, a significant difference in blood pressures was noted between the upper limbs (130/70 mm Hg on the right brachial artery, 90/70 on the left brachial artery). Other vital signs were normal: heart rate of 72 bpm and O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 98% in room air. A bruit was noted on auscultation over the left subclavian artery. No differences in pulse amplitude, strength, skin color or arm circumference were noted upon examination of the upper limbs, and carotid sinus massage and test for orthostatic hypotension were both negative. Provocative arm maneuvers resulted in dizziness, but not syncope. Electrocardiographic recording demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal PR interval, without ischemic changes in the ST-T segments; lab exams at admission demonstrated Troponin-T measurements of 15.5 and 13.4 ng/L, hemoglobin and glucose measurements were within normal range.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Computed tomography angiography scan, sagittal plane.

Indeed, CTA scan demonstrated an obstruction and retrograde filling of the right common carotid artery and obstruction of the right brachiocephalic trunk . To prove whether stealing of blood flow is the trigger for the recurrent syncope events, a Doppler ultrasound was done, revealing blood flow reversal in the right external carotid artery , a blunted _‘Parvus et tardus’_ blood flow in the right common carotid artery , and a ‘pre-steal’ component in the right vertebral artery .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Doppler ultrasound of the right common carotid artery.

As of yet, no further hospitalizations were reported.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition in which significant stenosis and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery results in a compromise of distal perfusion to the vertebral artery. As the stenosis progresses, a pressure gradient between the two vertebral arteries gradually emerges, favoring a reversed blood flow in the vertebral artery distal and ipsilateral to the diseased subclavian artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This condition is relatively rare, affecting ~2–4% of the general population, although prevalence is higher among those with concomitant established cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Treatment options for subclavian steal syndrome are diverse and mainly include angioplasty and stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> as well as bypass implantations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Indeed, Bates _et al._ reported a 76% 5-year survival in a large case series of patients who underwent subclavian artery stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In summary, our report demonstrates that subclavian artery stenosis is a rare cause for syncope that should be suspected if relevant clues emerge during meticulous history taking and physical examination of pulses and blood pressures.

It is not only rare, but also difficult to diagnose as the symptoms may be regarded as features of an ordinary pregnancy.

The median survival of HAS patients is about 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】The exact molecular mechanism of HAS remains unclear.

The patient had no history of liver disease and gastrointestinal problems before. Laboratory findings revealed anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed the presence of ascites, hydronephrosis (II°) and a fluid in the pleural cavities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed thickening of the gastric wall, enlarged perigastric lymph nodes and ascites . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an infiltrative ulcerated tumor in the lesser curvature of the stomach ~ 4 cm in size . Serum AFP level was elevated to 79,6 kU/l (normal range 0,5–5,5kU/l).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Magnetic resonance imaging: A) thickening of the gastric wall, B) perigastric lymph node enlargement and C) pleural effusion .</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy imaging: an infiltrative ulcerated tumor of the stomach 4 cm in size .</u>\n\n【12】Biopsy revealed an ulcerated tumor infiltrating lamina propria and the submucosal tissue .

The data analysis revealed two somatic mutations in the _PIK3CA_ gene: c.1023\\_1024insTACT (p.Thr342TyrfsTer12) and c.1025\\_1026insTA (p.Tyr343ThrfsTer3). Both mutations were located in exon 20 of _PIK3CA_ gene and resulted in an early stop codon.\n\n【18】Due to heterogeneous histologic features and immunophenotype diagnosis clinicians were notified that this tumor fulfills the criteria of a very aggressive subtype, a hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS).\n\n【19】After all the investigations, the 21-week-pregnant patient was diagnosed with stage IV gastric cancer (cT4 N1 M1). The case was discussed during a tumor board meeting. It was agreed that patient could only be treated with palliative chemotherapy. The patient was informed about her prognosis: she decided to terminate the pregnancy and start the treatment. After the abortion patient received 1st cycle of first-line systemic chemotherapy with the FOLFOX4 regimen (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil), but for the second cycle she arrived in significantly deteriorated physical condition. Progression of disease was confirmed: new metastases in the ovary, enlarged lymphadenopathy, progressing ascites, and pleural effusion. The patient developed small bowel obstruction, diffuse peritonitis and died 2 months after the initial disease presentation.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】HAS is a rare neoplasm and the annual incidence is approximately 0.58–0.83 cases per million people. Pregnancy-associated HAS is an extremely rare and aggressive subtype that accounts for < 1% of all gastric cancer. High serum AFP levels during pregnancy can mask the AFP production by the tumor, so suspicion of HAS may become a challenge for physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】AFP-producing gastric tumor was first reported in 1970 by Bourreille et al. The term ‘hepatoid adenocarcinoma’ was coined by Ishikura et al. in 1985. It can originate in various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, ovary, colon, lung, urinary bladder, pancreas, etc. but the stomach is the most common site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. It has histologic features resembling a hepatocellular carcinoma and can be confirmed by several immunohistochemical markers such as AFP, Glypican-3, SALL4, and Hep-Par 1. According to the literature, the incidence of AFP producing gastric cancer is from 1.3% to 15%, but AFP negative gastric cancer cannot exclude the possibility of HAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–10 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】HAS is a clinicopathological entity with its unique aggressive behavior and no proven effective systemic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–10 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The treatment of metastatic HAS (mHAS) remains even less elucidated. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the most efficient first-line systemic treatment. Some drugs (e.g. 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, docetaxel, paclitaxel) have been used for the treatment of mHAS. There is no standard chemotherapy regimen for treatment during pregnancy. The use of chemotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy is not recommended. The majority of patients presents with poor response to conventional chemotherapy. No specific driver gene mutations and biomarkers in HAS are known to provide effective therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The patient presented in our case received a systemic platinum-based chemotherapy FOLFOX regimen that is a safe and effective treatment in advanced gastric cancer. However, this treatment did not stop the progress of HAS and an aggressive course of the disease was observed. The pathogenesis of pregnancy-related gastric cancer is an issue of debate but in multivariate analysis, pregnancy was not found to be an independent risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】We performed molecular genetic testing of tumor DNA to select the best treatment option. Biomarkers such as PD-L1, MSI were negative, so the patient could not benefit from immunotherapy. Gene mutation analysis by NGS revealed mutations in the _PIK3CA_ gene that could explain the exceptionally aggressive course of this disease.\n\n【27】_PIK3CA_ gene mutation has been reported in 5% of cases in gastric adenocarcinoma and is significantly associated with a poor prognosis. The PI3K pathway plays a fundamental role in cell proliferation, differentiation, mortality, and survival. In addition, increased _PIK3CA_ mRNA have been identified in gastric cancer lymph node metastases, suggesting that _PIK3CA_ may be an indicator of gastric cancer metastasis. _PIK3CA_ gene alterations are predicted to be oncogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Our finding showed that _PIK3CA_ gene mutation is observable in HAS and may be one of the mechanisms in activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which can be associated with HAS cancerogenesis and with poor survival of HAS patients. In the future, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may be an effective target in HAS and gastric cancer.\n\n【29】This case represents the first report of pregnancy-associated hepatoid gastric cancer with _PIK3CA_ gene mutations. It can provide further clues for the understanding of molecular features of HAS and may lead to further effective treatment options.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to publication of this article.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author(s) received no financial support for the publication of this article.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The publication meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was obtained from the patient’s husband, a legally mandated person to the patient by the medical records.

The patient also reported an occasional dry cough. He mentioned the history of similar symptoms and associated pneumothorax twice, once in the same year and once 6 years before. Both of the episodes also occurred in the right lung, causing him to be hospitalized with a chest tube. Vital signs on arrival were oxygen saturation of 90%, blood pressure of 130/80, respiratory rate of 23 per minute and pulse rate of 98 beats per min.

In addition to cutaneous lesions, patients with BHD syndrome have bilateral, multiple, small and irregular-shaped cysts in the peripheral lung parenchyma. Unlike bullae in emphysema, which are usually found in the apices of the lungs, BHD cysts are more common in the bases. These cysts’ walls are covered with a layer of the alveolar epithelium, which is unique and puts patients at increased risk for recurrent pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】These cysts grow gradually and are hamartomatous, and in all cases, the cyst wall staining is positive for FLCN. The most worrying feature of BHD syndrome is its association with renal lesions, especially renal cancers. The prevalence of renal tumors in people with this syndrome is seven times higher. The most common renal cancer histopathologies are chromophobe and chromophobe-oncocytic, but papillary and clear cell types are also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. LAM is most often seen in young women with small thin-walled cysts that spread throughout the parenchyma of both lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare nodular and cystic disease of the lung interstitium that primarily affects young adult smokers. It is caused by aggregations of abnormal dendritic cells. Chest CT scan shows thickening of the interstitial tissue, as well as multiple cysts and nodules, usually in the upper lobes, sometimes leading to pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Another disease with similar lung involvement to BHD is pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, a life-threatening disease, which is observed in individuals with immunodeficiency. These patients are often referred to the hospital due to pulmonary insufficiency, fever and dry cough. Chest radiography of these patients shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrations, single or multiple nodules and sometimes pneumatocele and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs in patients with COPD. Bullae formation is associated with non-fibrotic degradation of the airways, and usually affects the upper lobes more than the lower lobes. These patients often have a history of smoking and coughing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our case was a 70-year-old man who was referred to the hospital with recurrent pneumothorax. Male sex, absence of immunodeficiency and smoking history, his imaging and cutaneous findings, as well as a family history of pneumothorax in his son are all highly suggestive of BHD disease. Considering the rarity, diagnosis of the disease and its complications is often delayed. Therefore, after diagnosis, annual medical follow-up with laboratory tests and imaging is recommended. For those patients with recurrent pneumothorax wedge resection or pleurodesis are beneficial. Moreover, the genetic evaluation of other family members is necessary for early diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case, BHD diagnosis was made due to recurrent pneumothorax, cutaneous lesions and imaging findings. Early diagnosis of these patients is valuable to alert providers to the need for annual renal cancer screening and to suggest possible treatment options. Determination of pneumothorax etiology is important in order to treat the patients appropriately.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This article was prepared without any support or funding.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ardabil University of Medical Science.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Mohammad Negaresh.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:36", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:51:57", "cost": 80.599}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:51:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:36"}

It is easily recurrent and has a high propensity for haematogenous spread especially to the lungs. We present the case of a 34-year-old Para 1 + 1 (1 alive) woman with recurrent vaginal mass of 8 years duration after two surgical excisions without histological evaluation. She had examination under anaesthesia and a wide local excision of the vaginal mass. Histological examination of the mass revealed poorly differentiated VLMS with positive surgical margins and she was commenced on adjuvant chemo-radiation. Histological evaluation remains the hallmark for diagnosing rare malignancies like VLMS, which unfortunately is not a standard practice in some resource-constraint settings.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary vagina cancer (PVC) is a rare occurrence in gynaecological practice. It accounts for ~1–2% of all malignancies in gynaecology and approximately one-tenth of all vaginal malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, as most vaginal malignancies are metastasis from other primary sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The cervix and vulva are the most common gynaecological sites, whereas the bladder, urethra and rectum are common non-gynaecological sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Majority of PVC are squamous in origin, followed by adenocarcinomas, while sarcomas are very rare, accounting for ~1% of vaginal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. Vaginal leiomyosarcoma (VLMS) is the most common form of vaginal sarcoma seen in adult women while rhabdomyosarcoma is commonly seen in children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. We present a rare case of recurrent primary VLMS, an overview of its management and challenge with diagnosis in resource-constraint setting.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 34-year-old Para 1 + 1 (1 alive) woman presented at the Gynaecological Outpatient Clinic of a public tertiary hospital in Lagos, Nigeria with 8 years history of recurrent vaginal mass and 5 years history of vaginal pain. The mass was initially small like a bean seed but gradually increased in size until it became palpable at the introitus. Vaginal pain was persistent, aching in nature, with a severity of 6 on the numerical pain scale and no aggravating or relieving factors. No history of vaginal instrumentation, abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, weight loss, respiratory, urinary and bowel symptoms. She had no history of pelvic irradiation, insertion of vaginal implant, personal or family history of uterine fibroids or malignancies. She had two surgical resections of the tumour in the past, but histology was not carried out due to financial constraint.\n\n【6】Her general, breast and abdominal examination findings were essentially normal but vaginal examination revealed a polypoid mass in the lower vagina. A diagnosis of recurrent vaginal polyp with suspected malignancy was made and she was counselled for examination under anaesthesia (EUA), wide local excision (WLE) and histological evaluation of the tumour.\n\n【7】Investigations revealed normal haematological, renal and liver function profiles. Hepatitis B, C and human immunodeficiency virus screenings were negative; Pap smear was negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. Serum cancer-antigen 125, carcino-embryonic-antigen, chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography scan were normal.\n\n【8】EUA revealed normal vulva and polypoid mass ~6 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm arising from the lower third of the right lateral vaginal wall. The mass was irregular, firm, encapsulated and attached to the muscular wall. The cervix, uterus, adnexae and rectum were normal. There were no enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. A WLE with a surgical margin of 10 mm was done and histology revealed nodular multi-lobulated solid firm masses with greyish white cut surfaces on macroscopy. Microscopic analysis showed a highly cellular encapsulated lesion, composed of interlacing fascicles of pleomorphic spindle shaped cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, bizarre multinucleated giant cells with abnormal mitosis >10 mitoses/10 HPF. The tumour cells show moderately strong positivity for ki-67, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin but was negative for s-100  and the surgical margins were positive for malignant cells. A diagnosis of poorly differentiated VLMS was made with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics clinical stage 1B disease. She had sequential chemo-radiation therapy with four courses of docetaxel and gemcitabine chemotherapy followed by external beam (45 Gy) and intra-cavitary (25 Gy) radiation. She responded well to the therapy and she is currently being followed up in the clinic.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrograph of haematoxylin and eosin histologic section (×100) shows interlacing fascicles of atypical spindle cells with patchy necrosis, abnormal mitoses and smudge cells.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrograph of ki-67 immunostain (×100) shows moderately strong nuclear staining in >30% of the cell population.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrograph of α-smooth muscle actin immunostain (×100) shows cytoplasmic staining of the smooth muscle cells.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrograph of S100 immunostain (×100) shows spindle cell negativity.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Primary VLMS accounts for 2–3% of vaginal malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This rarity has contributed to the poor understanding of its unique clinical characteristics that could aid early diagnosis. As a result, postoperative histology remains the hallmark of diagnosis, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> which was delayed in the case presented. The exact aetiology of VLMS is unknown. Exposure to pelvic radiotherapy and insertion of vaginal implants has been implicated in its aetiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>; but this was not the case in the patient presented. VLMS is believed to commonly arise from the smooth muscles of the vagina or its adjacent structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Majority (45%) arises from the posterior vaginal wall, followed by 34% from the lateral vaginal wall and 21% from the anterior vaginal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the patient presented, VLMS originated from the right lateral vaginal wall.\n\n【15】There are strict criteria for the diagnosis of PVC. This is because majority of vaginal malignancies are metastasis from other sites, with 80–90% from the cervix and vulva 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. As a rule, the cancer must be exclusive to the vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, with absence of clinical or histological evidence of cervical or vulvar malignancy or history suggestive of these cancers within the last 5–10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This rule was fulfilled in the case presented.\n\n【16】There are no established guidelines for the management of VLMS. However, surgical treatment with or without adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is recommended by most authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>. The preferred surgical treatment is WLE with clear margins. Because of the high rate of recurrence of VLMS and the high potential of haematogenous spread even with early stage disease and complete tumour resection; postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are frequently indicated especially in patients with metastasis, positive margins and risk factors for early recurrence. These factors include tumour size ≥ 3 cm, irregular tumour contour, presence of cellular atypia, ≥5 mitoses/10 HPF and poorly differentiated lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7–10 \\]</u>. The patient presented was commenced on adjuvant therapy because she had all the risk factors, positive surgical margins and a recurrent disease.\n\n【17】This case highlights the challenges encountered in resource-constraint settings where histological evaluation of surgical specimen is usually not considered important by patients and mandatory by physicians. Consequently, this test is usually delayed or not performed at all due to reasons such as financial constraint as seen in the case presented. This highlights the need for advocacy on the importance of performing histology on all surgical specimens, irrespective of the perceived pathology. Vaginal tumours are rare pathological entities that should be subjected to biopsy or excision for histological evaluation, irrespective of its size, clinical appearance and presence or absence of symptoms. This will ensure early diagnosis and management of any malignant lesion especially extremely rare and aggressive malignancy like VLMS.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors appreciate and thank everyone who contributed to the successful writing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no source of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval for this report was obtained from the human research and ethics committee of the public tertiary hospital where the patient was being managed (ADM/DCST/HREC/APP/3453).</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent.

Patients often present with respiratory distress, poor feeding with bouts of apnea and cyanosis. The diagnosis of CNPAS is made using a computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals a narrowed pyriform aperture with a width of less than 11 mm. While the exact cause of this condition is not clear, CNPAS has been associated with a missense mutation in the Sonic Hedgehog gene, SHH (I111F) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】A high degree of clinical suspicion is needed for timely diagnosis as infants are obligate nasal breathers in the first 5 months of life. Severe narrowing of the pyriform aperture significantly increases the resistance of the nasal passage leading to fatigue and respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis and adequate respiratory support are critical to help reduce the morbidity and long-term sequelae of this condition.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A newborn term baby presented with breathing difficulty immediately after birth. Oxygen saturation of 85% under room air was documented. There were associated subcostal recession and rapid breathing of more than 70 breaths per minute. The attending physician was not able to pass a 6 Fr feeding tube into the nasal cavity during routine suction. Oxygen saturation improved after the patient was supported with non-invasive ventilation. On physical examination, the child did not have any midline effects, hypotelorism, microcephaly, ocular abnormalities or simian crease. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT image in bone window at the level of the paranasal sinuses showing narrowed pyriform aperture stenosis.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Axial CT image in bone window at the level of the superior alveolar ridge shows solitary median maxillary central incisor (solid arrow, A) and a narrow triangular hard palate (dashed arrows, A). Coronal CT image showing a bony ridge at the inferior surface of the hard palate (B).</u>\n\n【10】CNPAS was suspected and an unenhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses was arranged. Narrowing of the pyriform aperture is the hallmark of CNPAS. CT scan demonstrated bilateral medial displacement of the nasal prominences resulting in extremely narrow nasal passages measuring 6 mm in width . There was an associated solitary median maxillary central incisor with a narrow triangular hard palate . Coronal reformatted CT images revealed a bony ridge along the inferior surface of the hard palate .\n\n【11】The child was treated with non-invasive respiratory support, regular suctioning and room air humidification. The child responded well to the conservative management and was discharged after 10 days. MRI was not performed due to restrictions brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the delivery and initial hospital admission. Subsequent follow-up under both paediatric otolaryngology as well as general paediatric clinics was planned.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Embryologically, the nasal grooves from the mesodermal layer are transformed into nasal pits in the first 8 weeks after conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Between the 8th and 24th week, the nasal pits are filled with epithelial tissue which then gets resorbed in normal development. Insufficient resorption of the epithelial plug leads to the formation of prominent nasal processes of the maxilla, resulting in a narrowed pyriform aperture. The reduction in the cross-section area at the pyriform aperture results in a significant increase in the resistance of the nasal passage. Consequently, the neonate needs to exert more effort for respiration.\n\n【14】By consensus, a pyriform aperture width of less than 11 mm is considered diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. CT scan of the paranasal sinuses is the most helpful modality to assess the nasal passage in neonates. First described in 1989, CNPAS can present as a sporadic anomaly or as part of solitary median maxillary central incisor syndrome (SMMCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As such, additional cross-sectional imaging (MRI) also plays an important role in identifying associated nasal anomalies (such as nasoethmoid encephaloceles), congenital brain anomalies (holoprosencephaly) and ocular defects (coloboma).\n\n【15】In our case, a routine examination by the paediatric retrieval team shortly after birth revealed signs of laboured breathing and impending respiratory distress. Routine nasal suctioning plays an important role in clearing the nasal passageway as well as providing a means of determining the presence and location of any possible airway obstruction. In CNPAS, the suction tube will invariably meet resistance after being inserted 2–4 mm into the nostrils, making further advancement impossible.\n\n【16】CNPAS should be distinguished from choanal atresia, which is the narrowing and obstruction of the posterior nasal airways by a bony or membranous septum. The clinical presentation of CNPAS and choanal atresia can be very similar as both cause subcostal recession, tachypnea and cyanosis. However, a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses provides adequate information to distinguish between the two conditions as the management approaches for each condition differ significantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Neonates with choanal atresia invariably need surgical intervention ranging from transnasal puncture, transpalatal repair, transnasal endoscopic repair and post-operative stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conversely, patients with CNPAS can be managed conservatively or with surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Conservative management is preferred when the neonate can maintain good oxygen saturation without signs of respiratory distress. In such cases, meticulous nasal hygiene and suctioning, application of adrenaline saline solution and room air humidification have shown to be effective treatment measures. Non-invasive respiratory support is given during this time and gradually tapered down. Severe CNPAS requires rhinoplasty which entails surgical widening of the nasal passage and the insertion of stents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Surgical intervention is also considered when non-invasive treatment does not help resolve the patient’s symptoms. The presence of associated craniofacial anomalies is the main cause of surgical treatment failure in approximately 14% of patients in one relatively sizeable study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. CNPAS is a condition that tends to improve as the child grows with an excellent prognosis. Even when initial surgery was inadequate, no recurrence has been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Prompt diagnosis and adequate respiratory support are crucial for neonates with CNPAS. Delay in initiating appropriate treatment puts the child at risk of respiratory distress and apnea which, in severe cases, may lead to ischemic brain injury and death. Diagnosis is made using an unenhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses with a pyriform aperture measuring less than 11 mm. Imaging also plays an important role in identifying associated craniofacial dysmorphism, which may affect treatment outcomes.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia for permission to publish this report.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have no funding source to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not required.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent has been obtained.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Yong Guang Teh.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Universiti Malaysia Sabah.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:45", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:56", "cost": 10.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:46"}

Six other family members affected with MJD died of the same pulmonary complication. To date, there has been no direct genetic linkage between MJD and familial spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the mutated ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene in MJD and Serpin Family A Member 1 (SERPINA1) gene in hereditary emphysema share the same loci on chromosome 14q32.1, which is suggestive of genetic proclivity of patients with MJD to develop familial pneumothorax. Furthermore, the abnormal ataxin protein encoded by ATXN3 and the patient’s smoking history could have potentiated the dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system further aggravating his genetic predisposition to develop recurrent pneumothorax.

Types are classified according to the genetic loci of the SCA. Of over 35 types of SCA identified, the most common is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, known as Machado–Joseph disease (MJD), which is caused by cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) expansions in the ATNX3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since 1997, only one case has been reported on recurrent familial pneumothorax in two siblings with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. To date, there has been no genetic linkage established between MJD and primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). In fact, established genetic variants in PSP only include human leukocyte antigen haplotype A2B40, alpha-1 antitrypsin, fibrillin 1 and folliculin mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report the first known case of recurrent familial spontaneous pneumothorax in a patient diagnosed with MJD highlighting the possible genetic correlation between these two disease entities.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】Our patient is a 42-year-old African American man who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. He had oropharyngeal dysphagia, productive cough, weight loss, blurred vision, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Since the age of 18 when he was diagnosed with MJD, he had progressively lost muscle control and coordination of his extremities until he was wheelchair-bound by age 38. He reported having recurrent aspiration pneumonia in his late 30s. In the previous year, he had two episodes of left-sided pneumothorax, which required thoracoscopic drainage and decortication. He had a 20-pack-year history of smoking.\n\n【7】On presentation, blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiration was 28 breaths/min and temperature was 37°C. He appeared chronically ill with generalized muscle wasting. Decreased tactile fremitus, hyperresonance and absent breath sounds in the right hemithorax were noted. Significant neurological exam findings included slow saccades, dysarthria, tongue fasciculations, rigid extremities with hyperreflexia, bilateral extensor plantar response, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, without sensorimotor deficits. Chest radiograph showed a large pneumothorax of the right lung with contralateral mediastinal shift . Chest CT scan showed right-sided pneumothorax with bilateral paraseptal emphysematous and bullous changes in the lung apices .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Chest radiograph showing large right pneumothorax with leftward mediastinal shifting.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|CT chest demonstrating bilateral paraseptal emphysematous changes and apical bulla (red arrow) resulting in pneumothorax .</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Chest CT showing right-sided pneumothorax  predominantly along the anterior aspect of the right hemithorax with chest tube in the major fissure (black circle). Significant bleb disease is also seen in the left lung.</u>\n\n【11】MJD was first diagnosed in his paternal grandmother in her 30s, his father, two uncles and three aunts in their late 20s and his younger sister in her late teens. His sister succumbed to aspiration pneumonia, his mother to an undiagnosed cardiac disease, while the others to pneumothorax complications .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|Pedigree structure of family.</u>\n\n【13】Supplemental oxygen was given, and a chest tube was initially placed at the ED. He eventually underwent right-sided thoracoscopic drainage of effusion, decortication and reinflation, which afforded maximal clinical improvement. He was discharged after 2 weeks. Repeat chest radiography after 2 weeks demonstrated a small right-sided pleural effusion and subpleural blebs without recurrence of pneumothorax.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】MJD is one of nine known polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases and is the most common autosomal dominant ataxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–7 \\]</u>. The patient’s family pedigree demonstrates the well-established 10-year ‘anticipation’ of worsening disease progression, suggesting that the larger numbers of CAG repeats will manifest in more progressive and severe disease with each successive generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, our patient had clinical manifestations demonstrative of the early onset subtype with progressive motor coordination and muscle control loss, resulting in being wheelchair-bound at age 38.\n\n【16】Spontaneous pneumothorax is a manifestation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously linked to MJD. It occurs without preceding trauma or obvious precipitating causes. In the absence of an underlying lung disease, it is termed primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) with an annual incidence of 7.4–37 per 100 000 in men and 1.2–15.4 per 100 000 in women and typically seen among young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. One retrospective study found 23.5% recurrence of PSP within the first 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The presence of subpleural blebs and bullae is seen in 80–90% of PSP cases. Other risk factors include cigarette smoke exposure, cannabis smoking and genetic predisposition. On the other hand, 80% of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax cases are seen in patients older than 55. Its typical causes include emphysema, interstitial lung disease, malignancy and necrotizing pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Given the presence of an underlying lung disease as well as contributing risk factors of smoking and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, the diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in our patient would seem less likely. However, with his significant history of MJD, and collateral history that six affected members died of pneumothorax complications, we believe that our patient has inherited susceptibility to spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n【18】The underlying pathogenetic defect of MJD is the CAG trinucleotide repeat found within the 5′ coding region of ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14q32.1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Interestingly, this is where the chromosome of the mutated SERPINA1 gene of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency underlying hereditary emphysema is located 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>. Recent data shows that the SERPINA1 gene acts as a protective agent in the lungs against neutrophilic proteolytic activity during inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Once mutated, it can predispose affected individuals to emphysema. Additionally, ATXN3 gene is responsible for the formation of the ataxin protein that is expressed in both neuronal and nonneuronal human tissue. A derangement of this system results in the accumulation of inclusional protein. This accounts for the progressive ataxia, dystonia and neuropathy in MJD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】There is also a growing evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism is responsible for homeostasis in the lung. Proteasomes aid in immunological defense against pathogens via antigen presentation. In a patient whose pathway is dysfunctional, this could theoretically lead to lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 10 \\]</u>. Furthermore, cigarette smoke also induces protein misfolding and aggregation. We posit that the dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may have been an additional factor that contributed to the recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax seen in our patient with MJD.\n\n【20】Further inquiries of the pathogenesis of extra-neuronal manifestations can be useful to our understanding of MJD. Although we don’t have sufficient data to prove that no other mutations are present in this patient to explain recurrent pneumothorax, the proximity of the aforementioned genes on the same chromosome loci should not be dismissed, nor should the potential for co-inheritance of these variants. This exploration invokes further molecular characterization to amplify medical knowledge and guide novel therapies that target the degradation of protein/s in MJD.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thank you Dr Lo and Dr Azmaiparashvili for the guided supervision in taking care of our patient and in editing this manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of interest statement._ No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no monetary or material support for this research investigation.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval is required.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent form was duly completed before writing the manuscript.

In TMA presenting with severe hypertension, it is difficult to determine whether the TMA is primary and due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or secondary to severe hypertension. The response to antihypertensive medication favors the diagnosis of severe hypertension as the cause of TMA. Comorbid inflammatory disease supports the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. This case describes a 75-year-old woman with Castleman disease who presented with severe hypertension and TMA. She improved with hypertension therapy. However, ADAMST13 showed zero activity, and the diagnosis was TTP. In cases of TMA accompanied by severe hypertension, it is challenging to diagnose the cause of TMA. Even when there is a pronounced clinical response to lowering blood pressure, the diagnosis of TTP should be considered, particularly when an inflammatory disease is present.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a syndrome characterized by thrombosis in capillaries and arterioles together with a clinical presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia and target organ injury. There are many causes of TMA, but the main categories are divided into primary and secondary. Primary TMA includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, complement-mediated TMA and cobalamin deficiency. Each of these types has a specific deficiency or impairment that should be identified and corrected to resolve the TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Secondary TMA is a process secondary to underlying systemic disease. Examples of secondary TMA causes are severe hypertension, infection, malignancy and autoimmune diseases. TMA is treated by diagnosing and treating the underlying disorder. Recognizing TMA as a medical emergency, prompt identification of its specific subtype and initiation of appropriate treatment are critical to minimize organ damage and enhance survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Differentiating between TTP and severe hypertension as the cause of TMA in patients who present with hypertension, thrombocytopenia, MAHA and target organ injury is difficult. In this paper, we present such a case, review the literature for similar cases and discuss the appropriate way to manage similar patients.\n\n【5】### Case presentation\n\n【6】A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain and headache. Two years prior to her admission, she was diagnosed with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), which had remained stable. It was characterized by lymphadenopathy and mild thrombocytopenia, and no treatment had been administered during this time. In addition, her medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Upon admission, her blood pressure (BP) was 240/111 mmHg; all other vital signs were normal (N). Her blood test revealed chronic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin, 9; MCV, 66), acute thrombocytopenia \\[platelets (PLTs), 21 000/μl\\], elevated bilirubin (2.7, UNL < 1.5 mg/dl), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (600 IU/L, UNL < 220) and undetectable haptoglobin. White blood cells, creatinine and coagulation parameters were within normal range, and Coombs test was negative. An ADAMST13 activity blood test was drawn and sent to the lab. Subsequently, neurologic signs developed: right hand weakness, full blindness, with a consciousness level rapidly deteriorating to a comatose state. Fundus examination showed exudative retinal detachment without tear. Numerous schistocytes were evident on a peripheral blood film. In suspicion of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests of the brain were conducted and did not demonstrate acute findings. The combination of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, the mentioned retinal findings and neurological signs, along with excessive hypertension, led to a diagnosis of hypertensive emergency with secondary TMA. Intravenous labetalol treatment was initiated, and her BP was gradually stabilized. After several hours, she became fully alert and all neurological signs resolved but the thrombocytopenia worsened (PLT 11 000/μl). Two days later, the result of the ADAMST13 blood test returned showing zero activity. Subsequently, plasmapheresis treatment was initiated (3 treatments) with a gradual improvement of PLT count to 236 000/μl . The patient was discharged with steroid treatment and hematology follow-up. Two months later, she presented with mild thrombocytopenia (PLT 90 000/μl), and schistocytes were observed in the blood film. Rituximab treatment was added and the PLT count gradually rose to within normal range.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Change in PLT count during hospitalization relative to PLT transfusions and plasmapheresis treatment.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】TMA is a medical emergency and should be rapidly diagnosed and treated. However, diagnosing the cause of TMA can be challenging, even for experienced clinicians. A study of 254 physicians found that 47% diagnose the underlying condition of TMA after >1 week of presentation, and 13% initiate treatment beyond 1 week post presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】TTP is the most common cause of primary TMA. Impaired activity of ADAMST13, a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, causes thrombi formation in small vessels and the clinical presentation of TMA. The most common underlying etiology is IgG antibodies formed against ADAMST13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Without plasmapheresis treatment, TTP has the highest mortality rate of all etiologies of TMA (90%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation are necessary. The diagnosis of TTP is confirmed by measurement of ADAMST13 activity. However, this test is not available in every hospital, and there can be a delay of days until the clinician receives the results. Therefore, in cases highly suspicious for TTP, as well as in cases of TMA without other identifiable etiology, plasmapheresis should be initiated, even without a definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Hypertensive emergency is an umbrella term for clinical conditions characterized by excessive hypertension presenting with target organ damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. One of these conditions is hypertensive encephalopathy, a syndrome of extreme hypertension and neurological deficits such as altered mental status, visual deficits and seizures. Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure following the failure of autoregulation mechanisms of brain vessels against excessively high arterial pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is the resolution of clinical symptoms and radiological signs following BP decrease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】As both hypertension-induced TMA and TTP may have similar clinical presentations, differentiating between the two can be complex. The case presented here concerns a female patient with a background of MCD who presented with a clinical and laboratory picture of TMA. Given that her presentation included severe hypertension with notable neurological signs that dramatically resolved upon BP stabilization, TMA secondary to severe hypertension was the suspected diagnosis; however, the final diagnosis was TTP.\n\n【14】Several case reports and discussions have addressed the challenge of differentiating between hypertension and TTP-induced TMA in patients who present with excessive hypertension and clinical presentation of TMA. The consensus is that patients with TMA should be managed with empiric plasmapheresis (PFX). Nevertheless, when there is a highly suggestive precipitating factor for TMA, and there is dramatic clinical improvement upon treatment, it is reasonable to delay PFX.\n\n【15】Khanal _et al_ . reviewed the literature for cases of hypertension-induced TMA and found that they are characterized by high mean atrial pressure (160 mmHg), median PLT count of 59 000/μl and significant acute kidney injury (AKI; average creatinine, 4.14 mg/dl). The most prominent finding was that all patients showed symptomatic improvement after lowering their BP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Abdalla _et al_ . described a 63-year-old patient who presented with dyspnea, hematemesis, epistaxis, blurred vision, severe hypertension (200/106 mmHg) and unremarkable findings in fundus exam. Laboratory results revealed hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia (PLT 40 000/μl) and markedly elevated creatinine (13.5 mg/dl). Numerous schistocytes per HPF were observed in peripheral blood smear, and the ADAMTS13 activity test showed 69% activity. PFX was started immediately, and there was profound AKI that required hemodialysis. The ADAMST13 test result did not support TTP, and the final diagnosis was malignant hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Mitaka _et al_ . describe a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with excessive hypertension (240/140 mmHg), AKI (CRT 11 mg/dl), thrombocytopenia (97 000/μl) and schistocytes in blood smear. Fundoscopy revealed hypertensive retinopathy, and MRI demonstrated posterior reversible encephalopathy. As the findings were highly suggestive of hypertension-induced TMA, the patient was treated with antihypertensive agents and hemodialysis, with subsequent dramatic improvement in his PLT counts and improved kidney function. ADAMST13 activity was 61%, excluding the diagnosis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Shibagaki _et al_ . described a 33-year-old male who presented with severe hypertension (160/120 mmHg) after discontinuing his antihypertensive medication. He was found to have thrombocytopenia (69 000/μl), MAHA and severe AKI requiring hemodialysis. Fundus examination revealed significant cotton exudates in both retinas. He was treated with intravenous antihypertensive agents with clinical and laboratory improvement. PFX was not initiated, and ADAMST13 activity was normal. The authors suggested that the immediate decision should rely on PLT counts. When there is severe thrombocytopenia (PLT < 5000/μl), empiric PFX should be imitated. Otherwise, the decision should be based on the clinical situation, including the degree of hypertension and history of longstanding hypertension, which favor the diagnosis of hypertension-induced TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Based on one case, Zheng _et al_ . suggested using immature PLT increments following PFX initiation as a support for the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. However, this method requires initiation of PFX prior to the final diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】As the most common cause of TTP is antibodies against ADAMST13, a presentation of TMA in patients with a background of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases may favor the diagnosis of TTP-induced TMA. Given that MCD is characterized by overproduction of cytokines and immunoglobulins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, it is reasonable to assume that MCD may be associated with TTP. Indeed, there are anecdotal reports of an association between CD and TTP. Benevides _et al_ . described the first case of ADAMST13 deficiency and TTP precipitated by unicentric Castleman disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. London _et al_ . described four cases of TTP associated with MCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In summary, we described a case of a patient with MCD who presented with TMA. The initial presentation was highly suggestive of TMA secondary to severe hypertension. Despite the dramatic clinical response to hypertension treatment, ADAMST13 activity was null and the final diagnosis was TTP.\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】Identifying the specific subtype of TMA rapidly and initiating the correct treatment is essential. In cases of TMA accompanied by severe hypertension, it is challenging to correctly diagnose the cause of TMA. Regardless of a dramatic clinical response to lowering BP, the diagnosis of TTP should still be considered, especially when there is a comorbid inflammatory disease.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval was not required for this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided written consent upon admission, acknowledging that their case may be used for academic purposes, including publication.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Itamar Feldman is the guarantor of this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:58:37", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:59:06", "cost": 29.725}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:59:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:58:35"}

The tumor was resected; however, the patient experienced recurrence 2 years later and subsequently received paclitaxel/carboplatin concurrently with radiotherapy. Within weeks of completing this treatment, he developed a symptomatic pancoast tumor secondary to disease progression and commenced second line nivolumab. Following the second dose of nivolumab, he developed acute unilateral right hearing loss. He commenced intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a slow taper of oral prednisolone. With steroids, he noted a gradual improvement in hearing, confirmed by audiology. Restaging imaging post-nivolumab demonstrated a complete metabolic response.

The global burden will continue to rise as the world population increases, particularly due to tobacco smoking. Lung cancer can be treated through surgical intervention, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The type of treatment will vary depending on the stage, histology and molecular subtype. Immunotherapy targeting the programmed-death receptor 1 (PD1), programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has transformed the treatment landscape for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first- and second-line settings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein expressed on the surface of cancer cells, which prevents anticancer immunity through interaction with the PD-1. As a result, cancer cells survive unhindered by the immune system. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab directly target PD-1, while atezolizumab and durvalumab inhibit PD-L1 from interacting with its receptor, with activity in NSCLC in various clinical settings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>.

This lesion was resected. No adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was offered at that point. In May 2018, the patient developed recurrent disease at the resection site . He received carboplatin and paclitaxel concurrently with radiotherapy over 6 weeks from June to July 2018. Within a few weeks of completing concurrent treatment, he developed a symptomatic pancoast tumor, with pain and swelling of the right upper limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest demonstrated an increase in tumor size. Due to disease progression, a decision was made to commence second line treatment with nivolumab. After the second dose of nivolumab, the patient presented to an ENT clinic with acute onset unilateral right-sided hearing loss. Unilateral sensorineural deafness was diagnosed on audiometry at both high- and low-frequency levels . That week he was subsequently reviewed at oncology follow-up. An MRI brain scan revealed no evidence of central nervous system involvement with disease . As no clear cause was evident on initial assessment to explain the hearing loss, the suspicion of immune related ototoxicity was raised. He commenced high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by a slow wean of oral prednisolone post-IV treatment. The patient had a gradual improvement in hearing. Repeat audiology confirmed reversal of the sensorineural deafness over time .\n\n【9】Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging post-nivolumab demonstrated a marked reduction of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, consistent with a complete metabolic response to immunotherapy . Based on this and the neurotoxicity, the patient remained off systemic treatment. He remains in follow-up and is clinically well. Sequential scans demonstrate ongoing stability with metabolically inactive disease. Repeated audiology showed further evidence of improvement in the hearing of the right ear .\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer, however, modulating the immune system can lead to immune-related adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A myriad of side effects have been observed in clinical trials, including dermatitis, colitis, hepatitis and myositis among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Grade 1–2 adverse events can usually be treated with oral steroids; however, grade 3–4 events require discontinuation of the ICI in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The first known case of autoimmune inner ear disease, reported an 82-year-old male who presented with metastatic mucosal melanoma and was initially treated with ipilimumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The patient was later commenced on pembrolizumab and developed acute hearing loss. He was diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. He received bilateral intratympanic dexamethasone injections. Otology confirmed an improvement in the patients’ hearing as well as a decrease in tumor size, 12 weeks later. The authors postulated that the cause was autoimmune in nature as a result of the pembrolizumab.\n\n【13】The second case, described a 67-year-old male who presented to the clinic with an invasive melanoma of the toe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Following amputation of his toe, he was treated with pembrolizumab, however, developed severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss after his first dose of therapy. The patient received intratympanic steroid injections and had a subjective return to baseline hearing. According to the authors, the FDA has already reported 22 cases of pembrolizumab-induced autoimmune inner ear disease with this case being 1 of 14 related to metastatic melanoma.\n\n【14】A clear similarity among the cases is a sudden onset of loss in auditory function upon treatment with an ICI, with a notable, sometimes subjective improvement in hearing with treatment. In our case, the patient’s auditory function was measured after hearing loss occurred and twice thereafter during recovery. A limitation to this case report is the lack of audiometry measurements pre-nivolumab. Therefore, we are unable to confirm whether the patient had prior hearing difficulties at baseline that may have contributed to his acute hearing loss. Baseline audiometry tests and ENT review should be considered in patients presenting for treatment with evidence of hearing loss prior to commencing ICI. Furthermore, this finding re-iterates the importance of advising the patient to contact their oncologist to discuss any acute toxicity that emerges upon ICI therapy.\n\n【15】Here, we described a case where a patient developed acute unilateral hearing loss of the right ear, after receiving a PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab. Reversibility of the hearing impairment was apparent on treatment with steroids. Two prior case reports have described a similar phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Our case is the first to report unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the lung cancer setting. We postulate the likely cause of the hearing impairment relates to autoimmune inner ear disease secondary to T-cell over activation affecting the vestibulocochlear nerve of the right ear. Given the clinical significance and potential reversibility, oncologists should be aware of this potential rare side effect. In the occurrence of ICI-induced hearing loss, we suggest early treatment with high dose steroids followed by a slow wean of oral steroids.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_Conflict of interest statement._ No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has reviewed the case content and has given written consent for his case to be published with this journal.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Aleksandra Rajapakse, Queensland University of Technology, Faculty of Health, School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Cancer and Ageing Research Program, Brisbane, QLD.

Within the central nervous system, basal ganglia are common sites of affection, but there are characteristic signs on neuroimaging identified due to involvement of brainstem.

Wilson's disease is due to mutations of the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) residing in the _trans_ \\-Golgi network of hepatocytes. Copper is collected in the liver, and after hepatic binding sites are saturated, it is released. Systemic disease then develops and there is an abnormal accumulation of copper in the brain.

Yousaf _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported a case of Wilson's disease with minimal involvement of the lentiform nuclei and marked lesions involving the thalami, midbrain and pons.\n\n【15】The midbrain ‘face of giant panda sign’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> is due to high signal in the tegmentum, normal signals in the red nuclei and lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, and hypointensity of the superior colliculus. The ‘face of the miniature panda’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, or the ‘panda cub’ sign seen in dorsal pons, is delineated by the relative hypointensity of the medial longitudinal fasciculi and central tegmental tracts (‘eyes of the panda’) in contrast to the hyperintensity of the aqueduct opening into the fourth ventricle (‘nose and mouth of the panda’) bounded inferiorly by the superior medullary velum. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)-like changes have been described with three distinct patterns: (i) characteristic round shape, (ii) bisected and (iii) trisected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The trisected pattern with CPM-like changes is also known as ‘trident’ or ‘Mercedes-Benz’ sign.\n\n【16】T2-weighted confluent hyperintensities in the cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes are also uncommonly seen in Wilson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The high signal intensity on T2-weighted images is believed to be due to oedema, gliosis, necrosis and cystic degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.

As mentioned, these neuroimaging signs have been reported previously in literature, but simultaneous occurrence of the ‘giant panda’ sign in midbrain and ‘trident’ sign in pons is a rare occurrence.

Our case is of a 50-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic lower anterior resection for the rectal cancer with lung metastasis 4 years ago developed cardiac tamponade due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. We performed pericardiocentesis as a temporary life-saving procedure, but pericardial fluid re-accumulated within a few days. She died 23 days after admission. When a patient with advanced colorectal cancer complains dyspnea, we should consider the pericardial metastasis, and perform the proper treatment as this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Distant metastases of colorectal cancer are often hematogenous, and liver metastasis are the most common affected site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pericardial metastasis is one of the rarer patterns of hematogenous metastasis of colorectal cancer, but it is very difficult to diagnose before death and even rarer to cause symptomatic cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We need requiring prompt management within a few hours or days for cardiac tamponade. But there are no established therapy after acute phase. This report describes a rare case of pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer, along with a literature review.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old woman presented to the hospital complaining of anemia. Her medical history included hyperthyroidism, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, urolithiasis, and panic disorder. She has no smoking history. She was diagnosed with a circumferential Type 2 tumor of the upper rectum in colonoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the circumferential wall, with a contrast effect in the upper rectum, a swollen #251 lymph node, and three pulmonary nodules suspected to be metastases . Laparoscopic lower anterior resection and lymph node dissection were performed to prevent intestinal obstruction due to the tumor. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated for lung metastases. A CT scan 4 years postoperatively revealed pericardial thickening . She had no subjective symptoms and only mild pericardial fluid retention, and chemotherapy was continued. Two months after the CT finding, she was brought to the emergency room due to respiratory distress. At admission, she presented with tachycardia and Beck’s triad (hypotension, venous distension and diminished heart sounds). CT scans revealed lung metastases of rectal cancer and accumulation of pleural effusion and pericardial fluid . Cardiologists confirmed the findings of pericardial fluid retention and a sign of right ventricle collapse on echography.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Images at the time of rectal cancer surgery.

Palpitation and dyspnea improved, and the patient’s breathing calmed down. A few days later, re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was noted. We performed a pathological examination of the collected pericardial fluid . In cytology, papanicolaou staining revealed atypical epithelial-like cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular shapes. Alcian blue staining revealed a small number of atypical cells with cytoplasmic mucin. In cell block immunohistochemistry, atypical cells were positive for CEA (Mono) and CDX-2, but negative for Calretinin, WT-1 and CD68 (PGM1). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. She was started on diuretics, but pericardial fluid quickly accumulated, gradually deteriorating her general condition. She died 23 days after emergency hospitalisation.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Pathology. (A) Pathology of rectal cancer \\[hematoxylin eosin (HE) stain\\].

The most common mode of metastasis in rectal cancer is hematogenous, with the liver being the most common distant metastatic site, followed by the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This is because, unlike colon cancer, rectal cancer drains from the distal rectal vein through the middle and inferior rectal veins to the internal iliac vein, and thus hematogenous metastasis is likely to occur bypassing the portal hepatic circulation. This may be the reason why the tumor cells directly extended into the pericardial tissue.\n\n【12】Cardiac metastasis of malignant tumors is a relatively common form of metastasis in the terminal stage of cancer. But it is rare to be diagnosed with pericardial metastasis of a tumor during life. This is because many cases of pericardial effusion due to cancer are not accompanied by chest pain and have a poor inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, so they are often not noticed until cardiac tamponade occurs. Symptomatic carcinomatous pericarditis has been reported in male patients with lung cancer and female patients with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, but rarely in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n【13】Treatment of cardiac tamponade in cancer patients includes systemic chemotherapy, pericardial adhesion therapy, and pericardial incision. Pericardial drainage is often used as a temporary life-saving procedure, but re-accumulation of pericardial fluid occurs in roughly 60% of patients treated with pericardial drainage alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Thus, many patients continue to require further treatment to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. Pericardial incision may be performed during the first cardiac tamponade in order to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. However, surgery is considered a difficult option due to concerns about surgical tolerance and postoperative quality of life, as many patients are in the terminal stages of the disease. After releasing pericardial fluid retention, systemic administration of antineoplastic drugs may prolong survival. In recent years, pericardial adhesion therapy by anticancer drugs has been performed as a new treatment to address cardiac tamponade. A JCOG study conducted in Japan reported that bleomycin or cisplatin is recommended for lung cancer, and thiotepa or cisplatin is recommended for breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, no effective anticancer drugs have been reported for colorectal cancer.\n\n【14】A review of the literature using PubMed (keywords ‘colorectal cancer’ and ‘pericardial metastasis’) identified only five cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–10 \\]</u> of cardiac tamponade with an antemortem diagnosis of pericardial metastasis from colorectal cancer, excluding current cases are excluded. In all cases, patients visited the hospital with acute onset respiratory distress. Pericardiocentesis was performed in four of the cases. Surgery was performed with or without pericardiocentesis in three cases; only one was successful, and one died during surgery. Pericardial adhesion therapy was performed in one patient, but the effect was poor. Percutaneous drainage was also performed early in our case, and temporarily relieved the cardiac tamponade. Although early re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was observed after pericardiocentesis in this patient, surgery was not performed because of his general condition and poor prognosis, and the best supportive care policy was adopted.\n\n【15】Advances in medical care have made it possible for patients with distant metastases to survive for a long period of time. When a cancer patient with distant metastasis presents with dyspnea due to pericardial tamponade, it is necessary to not only provide first aid to relieve symptoms but also to submit the collected pericardial fluid for pathological examination to diagnose whether the pericardial effusion is due to pericardial metastasis. And we need to pursue further treatments for long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients with pericardial metastasis.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We explained the clinical trials and disclosure of information to the patient’s family and obtained written consent.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Junichi Mazaki, MD.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:27:24", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:30:46", "cost": 201.82}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:30:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:27:23"}

She received darbepoetin alpha (DPO) for transfusion-dependent anaemia and was free from transfusion. However, after 8 months, DPO lost effectiveness. She then received CERA and recovered from anaemia. Her haemoglobin level remained >10 g/dl for 3 years and 4 months. However, even CERA lost effectiveness, and she received roxadustat treatment with CERA, leading to recovery from anaemia again.\n\n【3】Although further evidence is required, the extension of the no-transfusion period provided by ESAs and roxadustat is important and is awaited among low-risk MDS patients.\n\n【4】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【5】Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, caused by excessive premature apoptosis of haematopoietic precursors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Anaemia treatment and reduction of transfusion-need are, therefore, major therapeutic goals in patients with low-risk MDS. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are widely used to reduce the need for RBC transfusion in low-risk patients with MDS.

Our previous study reported a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, continuous epoetin β pegol, an erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), as a therapeutic option after DPO failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Herein, we provide further information regarding treatment after DPO failure among low-risk patients with MDS and report our experience of long-term CERA use and treatment after CERA failure.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 65-year-old Japanese woman, whose detailed clinical information has been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, was diagnosed with MDS via bone marrow aspiration in 2008. She had refractory anaemia, as defined by the World Health Organization and was categorized by the IPSS (the International Prognostic Scoring System) as belonging to the low-risk group (IPSS low or Int-1). She had diabetes since 1991; with resultant renal insufficiency, haemodialysis was initiated in January 2015. She was transfusion dependent, with haemoglobin levels maintained at 6.5 g/dl via transfusion every week 44 during the predialysis period. Frequent transfusions resulted in congestive heart failure and secondary hemochromatosis; she was diagnosed with transfusion-associated circulatory overload. Accordingly, treatment with epoetin α (9000 IU/week) plus DPO (40 μg/week) was started with haemodialysis initiation. However, even after ESA initiation, she continued to require transfusion. In July 2015, we increased the DPO dose to 240 μg/week. After 2 weeks of DPO treatment, the anaemia resolved; she no longer needed transfusions, and the haemoglobin concentration was maintained at > 10 g/dl. From March 2016, she gradually developed resistance to DPO treatment. In July 2016, her haemoglobin concentration rapidly decreased to 6.8 g/dl and she needed transfusions again. We then switched the ESA from DPO to CERA (250 μg/week) in August 2016. After switching, the haemoglobin concentration again gradually increased, and she no longer needed further transfusions. No progression of anaemia was observed for 3 years and 4 months; her haemoglobin concentration was stable at > 10 g/dl. In December 2019, although her iron metabolism was stable and anaemia treatment did not change, her haemoglobin concentration fell to < 10 g/dl, reaching 8.9 g/dl in January 2020. Throughout this period, no obvious physical changes or particular adverse events were observed. Accordingly, we suspected that the drop was caused by CERA treatment failure and initiated roxadustat treatment. First, roxadustat at 150 mg/week was initiated along with CERA (150 μg/week), and the roxadustat dose was later increased to 300 mg/week. Her haemoglobin concentration increased again, and we decided to gradually switch the drug to roxadustat alone and decreased CERA to 50 μg/week. However, this change resulted in a decrease in the haemoglobin concentration. Therefore, we administered both CERA (150 μg/week) plus roxadustat (300 mg/week). Her haemoglobin level is currently maintained at >10 g/dl for over a year .\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】The clinical course of our patient provides two important indications: (i) CERAs may be able to reduce the transfusion-need among low-risk patients with MDS and (ii) roxadustat when used along with ESAs may be able to control anaemia.\n\n【12】The introduction of CERA in MDS treatment may be favourable for low-risk patients with MDS. In our case, CERA treatment led to a long-term freedom from transfusions. ESAs lose their effectiveness with regard to anaemia treatment in low-risk patients with MDS in a few years. Epoetin loses its effectiveness in 0.42 years and DPO in 0.75 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Prevention from transfusion-dependent anaemia leads to improved QoL and overall survival in low-risk MDS patients. In low-risk MDS patients, the utility scores from which quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are calculated are higher for transfusion independence than for transfusion dependence, with a difference of 0.24 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Furthermore, as she avoided treatment for iron overload caused by transfusions, she obtained a utility score of at least 0.21 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus, she achieved 1.65 QALYs after CERA treatment.\n\n【13】Roxadustat may compensate for the loss of effectiveness of CERA in low-risk MDS patients if anaemia results from the loss of effectiveness of CERA. In our case, although adding roxadustat to CERA resulted in recovery from anaemia, when we stopped CERA treatment, the anaemia recurred. Although the starting dose was low (1.67 mg/kg), roxadustat may not induce sufficient effects as a single agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Roxadustat as well as granulocyte colony stimulating factor may achieve a 30% improvement in ESA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and reduce ESA resistance among low-risk patients with MDS by suppressing apoptosis of haematopoietic stem cells.\n\n【14】The following points should be noted when interpreting this case report: first, anaemia progression while using CERA may not have resulted from ESA resistance. However, the abovementioned discussion about the combination of ESA and roxadustat holds because reducing the dose of ESAs diminished the effects of roxadustat, leading to the promotion of anaemia. Second, the safety of using roxadustat in patients with MDS has not been confirmed. Roxadustat should not be used for solid tumours, and the results of a phase III trial concerning its use in low-risk MDS patients are awaited.\n\n【15】In our case, we examined the long-term use of CERA in a low-risk patient with MDS having anaemia and found that after the failure of CERA, supplementation with roxadustat was effective. Although further evidence is required, ESAs may extend the no-transfusion period among low-risk patients with MDS.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Hideki Hattori, who is our patient’s haematologist in Yao Municipal Hospital.

RR-TB is TB caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ strains that are resistant to rifampicin, whereas MDR TB is defined as TB with _in vitro_ resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin and XDR-TB are strains that fulfill the definition of MDR/RR TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinoles (Moxifloxacillin/Levofloxacillin) and at least one additional group A drugs i.e. Bedaquiline or Linezolid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Previously, management of DR-TB has been a problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> but now with the coming of new and repurposed drugs, there is an improvement in the DR TB treatment outcomes and linezolid is among the best drug when added to Multi drug regimen and Extensive drug regimen with Bedaquiline and Pretomanid (BPaL). Linezolid is an antibiotic in the group of Oxazolidinones that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The toxicity profile of linezolid—which includes partially reversible myelosuppression, optic neuritis, neuropathy and lactic acidosis—limits its use. Studies have shown that treatment limiting toxicity can occur in as many as 11% of persons who receive treatment with linezolid. Adverse events mostly occur when linezolid is given at doses of >600 mg a day, but they can usually be identified early with routine monitoring and are often reversible upon discontinuation of the drug or lowering of the dose. Pyridoxine could be used when linezolid is administered to minimize side effects. Knowledge about the safety of linezolid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited so caution is advised and it is not clearly on the duration for side effects to appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【4】An 81-year-old HIV-negative Malawian man was diagnosed with Rifampicin resistance (RR) TB through Xpert MTB/Rif and was confirmed Multi Drug resistance (MDR) tuberculosis with culture and drug susceptibility testing which was done at National Reference Laboratory. He had no TB history even in his family, but there was history of working in mines in South Africa around 1970s. Contact investigation was done to his four household and close contacts and all were screened negative. Baseline investigations revealed hemoglobin of 12.4, platelets of 147, ALT of 6.8 and AST of 16.68 and chest X-ray with cavities on both lungs . He had no comorbid condition and was not taking any other medicines. With the baseline assessment results, he was put on Longer Regimen All Oral comprised of Bedaquiline 400 mg for 2 weeks then 200 mg for 22 weeks making a total of 6 months, Linezolid 600 mg once a day, Clofazimine 100 mg once a day, Cycloserine 750 mg once a day, Levofloxacillin 1000 mg once a day and Pyridoxine 150 mg once a day. He was receiving this medication as an outpatient but under DOT by a trained nurse and a volunteer and was scheduled to be attending monthly clinical monitoring and follow-up review.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|A chest X-ray which was taken before starting treatment with cavities more prominent to the left than right lung.</u>\n\n【6】At Week 8 while at home, he started vomiting fresh blood and was taken for admission at Karonga district hospital for intensive care and Rockall score was used to determine the severity of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) bleeding although endoscopy was not done due to machine failure (Rockall score of 5). Upon assessment, there was no pertinent risk factor of upper GIT bleeding i.e. no history of smoking, alcohol intake, use of NSAIDs, anticoagulation, and there was no chronic liver disease and peptic ulcer disease. On examination, he had a low BP (85/50 mmHg), PR 118 b/min, RR 20 b/min, temperature of 36°C and the rest of the physical examination was normal. Whole blood count was done, hemoglobin of 4.7 from 12.4 and platelet count was 79 from 147 at baseline, respectively. He was transfused with four units of whole blood in total and linezolid was stopped immediately. All other medicines remained the same with no dose modification and the bleeding stopped spontaneously after 2 days while on treatment. He was diagnosed with an adverse event that was graded to 4 with as life-threatening. An adverse drug reaction report was filled and sent for pharmacovigilance at Malawi Pharmacy and Medicine Regulatory Authority. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of vomiting blood like esophageal varices, esophageal tear, perforated peptic ulcer disease or esophagitis. There was nothing abnormal detected on ultra sound scan on the abdomen. He stayed in the ward for a week and then later was discharged with hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl and platelet count of 145. He was to continue with monthly follow-up , and iron tablets were supplied for a month. The patient culture converted to negative at Month 2 and he remained culture negative up until 18 months when he was finishing treatment. Linezolid was not re-introduced and there was no further episode of vomiting blood and patient was declared cured.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|A table of baseline and monthly follow-up results.</u>\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Linezolid is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic; however, severe adverse effects including myelosuppression, optic neuritis, peripheral neuritis, lactic acidosis are common. Of note, it is the only medicine in Group A that has myelosuppression as one of the adverse event, whereas others in the same group like Bedaquiline, levofloxacin and Clofazimine mainly causesQT prolongation, headache, skin hyperpigmentation and hepatotoxicity. Some studies have reported that the rate of adverse events due to linezolid was high and the most adverse event reported frequently were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea), peripheral neuritis and optic neuritis and that the rate of myelosuppression including anemia and neutropenia was 32.9% higher and the presence of myelosuppression in the group with an initial dose of linezolid >600 mg per day was higher than that in the groups with an initial dose of linezolid less than or equal to 600 mg per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Linezolid toxicity is due to structural homology between target 23 s rRNA in _M. tuberculosis_ and 16 s rRNA in human mitochondria resulting in a narrow therapeutic index and uncertainty around dose optimization. It is reported in one of the study that 38 XDR TB who treated with linezolid demonstrated the inverse association between linezolid trough concentrations associated with lower mitochondrial function and commented that long-term use of linezolid is associated with development of the mitochondrial toxicities of peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, which is contrary with this case report as it happened within 8 weeks of starting the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Other studies have reported that linezolid is effective and safe for the elderly with Gram-positive bacterial infection, but platelet count should be well monitored and that HIV may be a risk factor of linezolid-associated adverse events which in this case is HIV negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is also reported that there is limitation on evaluation of the efficacy and safety of linezolid as efficacy in clinical practice is likely higher due to the additive or synergistic effect when used as combination with other drugs and that linezolid profile is not yet completely known and therefore need quality clinical research to better understand the appropriate dosage that clinicians can prescribe to minimize the probability of events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】Much as linezolid is given and presumed safe in patients on second-line anti-TB, knowledge about the safety of linezolid associated with hematemesis is limited. Published adverse event reports lack adequate information regarding hematemesis after initiation of linezolid. In our case, the relationship between linezolid and the onset of hematemesis is plausible. Health workers should be alert to the possibility of such adverse reaction.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Malawi National TB/leprosy elimination program will support.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:26:18", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:26:27", "cost": 8.368}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:26:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:26:18"}

In almost all documented cases, there is an association between clinical and radiological findings. We report a case of an 82-year-old man with hemichorea in the setting of hyperglycaemia and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. He had subtle striatal changes on his radiology, and with intravenous fluids and insulin, his involuntary movements resolved on day 4, which correlated with improvement in glycaemic control. He was followed up through our local insulin stabilization programme after discharge.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Neurological complications due to hyperglycaemia encompass stroke, peripheral neuropathies, movement disorders and changes in behaviour and consciousness. Diabetic striatopathy is a combination of radiological changes and movement disorders including chorea, ballism and choreoathetosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Predominantly, this occurs in older women and in Asian populations with type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Usually, correction of a hyperglycaemic state results in partial to complete resolution of the movement abnormalities, and associated radiological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Some cases require pharmacological management if the movement disorder persists despite improving glycaemic control. This case report demonstrates the rare neurological manifestations of hyperglycaemia and poorly controlled diabetes.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】This 82-year-old gentleman had a medical history of T2DM, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, bilateral total knee replacements, left hip osteoarthritis, macular degeneration and chronic lower back pain (managed with amitriptyline 25-mg nocte). He was a heavy drinker (currently drinks two standards a day) and is a non-smoker who presented to the Emergency Department following a fall with no signs of alcohol withdrawal or relapse, on a background of 2 weeks of right-sided involuntary movements. He had changes in his behaviour, notably, short temper and irritability. Physical examination demonstrated a normal neurological examination except for writhing, dancing-like movements in the right side of the body affecting his face, arm and leg, consistent with hemichorea with no other signs of Parkinsonism. These movements worsened with activity and disappeared with sleep. However, the movements were not incapacitating. His diabetes was poorly controlled with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy managed with metformin, and prior to admission reported no recent hypoglycaemic episodes. Biochemistry revealed a non-ketotic hyperglycaemic state with a capillary blood glucose level of 25 mmol/L, serum osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg (reference range (RR) 280–300) and a calculated serum osmolality level of 291. His urea, electrolytes, liver and thyroid function tests as well as corrected calcium and magnesium levels were normal. Serum-glycated haemoglobin was 14.6% (136 mmol/mol, RR 20–42). He underwent a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) brain scan which demonstrated abnormal attenuation in the basal ganglia bilaterally, however, slightly more prominent on the left, and no other intracranial abnormalities . His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan  showed moderate microangiopathy and subtle striatal abnormalities bilaterally.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|CT brain scan.

Mild hyperdensity in both basal ganglia was present, slightly more prominent on the left.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|MRI at the level of the basal ganglia: SWI sequencing with signs of mineralization.</u>\n\n【8】Expert neurological opinion found no evidence of a causative medication, structural lesion, neurodegenerative disorder, infection, inflammatory process or paraneoplastic syndrome underlying the hemichorea. Initial management involved intravenous regular insulin Actrapid 4 units/hour and then was switched to Ryzodeg 70/30 degludec/aspart co-formulation insulin 30 units, given subcutaneously pre-breakfast. He received 4 days of treatment with subcutaneous insulin Ryzodeg and the movements completely resolved, with the blood glucose levels decreasing initially to 11–24 mmol/L during intravenous infusion and then to 6–12 mmol/L on subcutaneous insulin. After discharge, his insulin doses were titrated according to home self-monitoring blood glucose levels through the insulin stabilisation programme to ensure good diabetes control and prevent relapse of the hemichorea. It was concluded that the hemichorea was secondary to hyperglycaemia and poorly controlled T2DM.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】Involuntary movements in hyperglycaemic syndromes typically involve the limbs; however, they less commonly affect muscles of the jaw and tongue, and usually are unilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Generally, a significant positive correlation exists between the clinical and imaging findings, with radiological changes occurring usually contralateral to the affected limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A lack of corresponding radiological changes during the acute phase of hyperglycaemic chorea is rare and may be misleading 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Patients with positive findings can be misdiagnosed as an acute intracerebral haemorrhage. The differential diagnosis for T1-weighted hyperintensities in the basal ganglia includes hypoxia, chronic liver disease, manganese toxicity, disorders of calcium metabolism and rarer diseases such as lupus. Other causes are alcohol and methanol toxicity, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxaemia and deep cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 7 \\]</u>. An important cause of bilateral hyperdense basal ganglia is calcification, which commonly occurs due to age and can mask pathologies such as striatopathy.\n\n【11】In non-ketotic hyperglycaemia, brain metabolism shifts to the alternative anaerobic pathway with rapid depletion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), resulting in hyperkinetic movements. In the presence of ketosis, GABA can be resynthesised by using acetoacetate thereby explaining the less common occurrence of striatopathy in diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hemichorea related to diabetes slowly improves following restoration of glycaemic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. It is postulated the quick resolution is due to rapidly reversing changes in the brain parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Importantly, an investigation for associated paraneoplastic conditions requires consideration in this age group if symptoms persist or recur.\n\n【12】The mainstay is treatment of hyperglycaemia, usually with insulin and intravenous fluids to enable rapid but safe correction of the glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Additional therapies include anticonvulsants, GABAergic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and dopamine-depleting inhibitors. In this case there was rapid spontaneous resolution following glycaemic control and hydration, thus evading the need for symptomatic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A rapid decrease in intravascular osmolality results in water movement into brain cells, causing cerebral oedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The current postulated pathophysiology underpinning diabetic striatopathy includes astrocyte infarction, petechial haemorrhages, mineral deposition, methaemoglobin deposition, gliosis, atrophy, myelinolysis and myelin destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. This case supports the phenomenon of petechial haemorrhages, given the subtle abnormalities on imaging, which is consistent with previous literature, particularly where patients were monitored, and their lesions resolved after correction of hyperglycaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【14】There are very few cases documented of hyperglycaemia with hemichorea or hemiballismus and unremarkable imaging. The mechanism is unclear but microhaemorrhages in the brain parenchyma that resolve with resolution of the hyperglycaemia are postulated. This case highlights the subtlety and novelty in detecting radiological abnormalities, the importance of recognising hyperglycaemia as a cause of involuntary movements, and to avoid rapid correction of very high hyperglycaemia due to the risk of cerebral oedema. We present this case to help educate fellow clinicians regarding the difficulties detecting changes with diabetic striatopathy, and the importance of clinical examination in these cases.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We particularly acknowledge Drs.

After pericardial drainage for drug-resistant right heart failure, she developed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and cardiogenic shock caused by severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Findings during emergency surgery included tricuspid valve (TV) junction failure caused by shortening of the chordae tendineae of the TV, which is an organic abnormality. Additionally, myocardial biopsy results revealed myocarditis. Although acute myocarditis developed with RV dysfunction, pericardial effusion suppressed venous return, which temporarily improved her pathological condition. However, RV dysfunction and severe TR were thought to have manifested after the venous return suppression was alleviated by pericardial drainage. Because venous return changes significantly after pericardial drainage, it is necessary to examine the need for drainage and re-evaluate the post-operative RV system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pericardial effusion suppresses venous return, which may conceal right ventricular (RV) or tricuspid valve (TV) dysfunction. If pericardial drainage is performed for such cases, then increased venous return may reveal RV dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and the risk of cardiogenic shock may develop. We present the case of a patient with shortened chordae tendineae of the TV in whom pericardial effusion concealed severe TR. Drainage revealed TR, which was accompanied by RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with no apparent history of rheumatic fever and cardiac diseases presented with general malaise and was hospitalized. On admission, her blood pressure and pulse were 120/87 mmHg and 60 beats/minute, respectively. The blood test revealed the following results: brain natriuretic peptide, 186 pg/ml (reference, 0–18.4 pg/ml); cardiac troponin I, 0.038 ng/ml (reference, 0–0.025 ng/ml); creatinine kinase (CPK), 228 U/l (reference, 29–248 U/l); CPK-MB, 30 U/l (reference, 5–25 U/l) and C-reactive protein, 2.69 mg/dl (reference, 0–0.14 mg/dl). Furthermore, an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a marked PQ duration of 0.48 msec; however, no ST-segment elevation was noted by an 18-lead ECG. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal cardiac function and pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the RV and 18 mm around the left ventricle (LV).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|TTE at the time of admission; ( **A** ) Parasternal short-axis view: pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the right ventricle and 18 mm around the LV; ( **B** ) modified apical four-chamber view; TR insufficiency is unclear.</u>\n\n【7】There was no obvious evidence of valvular diseases, including TR. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) revealed pericardial and thoracoabdominal effusions . On the day of admission, her hemodynamic status was stable and treatment was initiated with diuretics. However, the next day, her symptoms worsened and urine output was poor; therefore, pericardial drainage was performed to remove 320 ml of yellow and turbid pericardial fluid. The subjective symptoms improved thereafter; however, she experienced cardiogenic shock the day after treatment. TTE revealed that the TV ring diameter had enlarged from 33 mm (at admission) to 45 mm and that severe TR had developed . Emergency catheterization was performed to evaluate hemodynamics, coronary artery lesions and valvular diseases. Swan–Ganz catheterization revealed cardiac output, cardiac index and SvO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.35 l/min, 1.68 l/min/m <sup>2 </sup> and 45%, respectively. Increased right atrial pressure and an increased v-wave were also observed . Right ventriculography  revealed a 30% decrease in the RV ejection fraction and severe TR (Seller’s classification grade 3). The coronary artery and LV ejection fraction were normal, and mild mitral regurgitation was noted. Furthermore, a myocardial biopsy of the RV septum was performed. Despite insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, her hemodynamic status did not improve. Because of circulatory failure caused by severe TR, TV replacement (TVR) surgery was performed (27 mm; MAGNA MITRAL EASE Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Intraoperatively, the chordae tendineae of the TV were markedly shortened . Thereafter, a biopsy revealed T-lymphocyte infiltration and myocardial fibrosis . The patient was diagnosed with acute myocarditis. She was discharged 45 days after admission and remained free of cardiovascular events for the next 3 years.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Thoracic and abdominal CT performed at admission; ( **A** ) moderate pericardial effusion and right pleural effusion at the transverse section; ( **B** ) moderate pericardial effusion at the coronal section.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|TTE after pericardial drainage; ( **A** ) apical four-chamber view: severe TR signal using Doppler echo with TV insufficiency during systole; ( **B** ) parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level: TV insufficiency during systole; a severe TR signal is noted secondary to TV insufficiency using Doppler echo.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Right ventriculography image obtained in the 30° right anterior oblique view shows a 5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted via the right femoral vein approach; the contrast concentrations in the right ventricle and right atrium appear nearly identical.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Intracardiac pressure waveform with a Swan–Ganz catheter; ( **A** ) the right atrial mean pressure is 15 mmHg; arrows indicate an increase in the v-wave height; ( **B** ) the RV systolic pressure is 34 mmHg, whereas the RV end-diastolic pressure is 15 mmHg; ( **C** ) the pulmonary artery pressure is 34/15 mmHg; ( **D** ) the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is 18 mmHg; ( **E** ) the LV systolic pressure is 123 mmHg, whereas the LV end-diastolic pressure is 20 mmHg; ( **F** ) the aortic pressure is 119/60 mmHg.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|Surgical findings during TVR; ( **A** ) arrows indicate the shortened TV chordae tendineae; ( **B** ) the arrow indicates the shortened TV chordae tendineae; the chordae tendineae were shortened to the extent that the papillary muscle and leaflet were almost attached.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|Histopathological findings after RV myocardial biopsy; ( **A** ) infiltration of T lymphocytes and disappearance of cardiomyocytes are observed in some parts of the myocardial tissue; ( **B** ) enlarged image of the circled region in (A); vasculitis and fibrosis of the cardiomyocytes are observed.</u>\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】This case comprised underlying organic abnormalities of the chordae tendineae of the TV and incidental presentation with RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis. Pericardial drainage, which was performed as treatment, caused the TR and RV dysfunction to manifest and led to cardiogenic shock. Pericardial drainage reportedly causes preload variation before and after drainage in the right heart system, which is susceptible to pericardial cavity pressure; furthermore, the RV diastolic volume increases after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Compared to in the general population, the right heart system was more susceptible to venous return of this patient with shortened TV chordae tendineae, which led to the enlargement of the right heart system and severe TR caused by TV junction insufficiency. Acute myocarditis can be fatal, mainly because of pump failure and fatal arrhythmias secondary to LV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; however, RV dysfunction secondary to myocarditis alone can be serious in patients with organic abnormalities (such as TV tendon shortening). It should be noted that acute myocarditis causing only RV dysfunction may also cause hemodynamic instability.\n\n【17】Severe RV function and TV dysfunction have occurred after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient was at high risk because her symptoms worsened after admission and pericardial drainage was a priority. If the presence and severity of myocarditis could have been ascertained by gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; because of the possibility of acute myocarditis based on the presence of increased myocardial deviation enzymes and atrioventricular conduction delay on admission), then pericardial drainage might have been avoided. Colchicine administration is effective for pericardial effusion caused by pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, acute myocarditis was not diagnosed initially; TVR was performed to manage TV chordae tendineae shortening, which is an organic disorder. However, if the transient RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis had been an exacerbating factor, then medical therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would have improved the situation, and TVR might not have been necessary. For a previously reported case, medical therapy achieved an improvement in cardiogenic shock caused by RV dysfunction combined with TV dysfunction after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Conversely, TVR still may have been necessary for the present case because of the tendon abnormality.\n\n【18】TR is classified as primary and secondary. Primary TR, a structural abnormality of the TV, accounts for ~8% of all TR cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; possible causes include Epstein’s malformation, infective endocarditis, pacemaker leads, chest trauma and rheumatic fever. Conversely, congenital TR with structural abnormalities but without a history of these conditions has also been reported; some cases have been diagnosed at an advanced age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

Trisomy 13 mosaicism is a subtype that may result in a milder form of the disease, potentially leading to a longer life expectancy in these patients, allowing them to reach puberty. In this report, we discuss the case of a young boy who was evaluated for delayed puberty and karyotyping revealed mosaicism for trisomy 13. A detailed history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies and imaging were performed that showed a picture of suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an abnormal male karyotype with mosaicism for trisomy 13. To date, there is no clear explanation to the association between trisomy 13 and gonadal axis, specifically with normal imaging of pituitary. We postulate that delayed puberty could be a clinical feature of mosaic trisomy 13.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13) was first described in 1960 by Dr Patau _et al_ . It is the third most frequent chromosomal trisomy with an incidence of about 1/8000–12 000 births. Compared with the general neonatal mortality rate, the estimated mortality rate from trisomy 13 is about 50 times higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In total, 28% of newborns with Patau syndrome die within the first week of life, 44% in the first month and 86% by 1 year of age. Survival beyond the first year of life is unusual and exceptional beyond the first decade, with only a small number of cases experiencing pubertal age. Mortality in Patau is attributed to cardiopulmonary failure, congenital heart defects and pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In 5% of cases, not all cells are trisomic; some are euploid; this is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. This entity is not well described but may lead to a milder form of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Delayed puberty is yet to be reported in these patients, likely owing to the short life expectancy.\n\n【5】In this report, we discuss a case of mosaic trisomy 13 who presented with delayed puberty. We tried to establish that there could be a possible association between mosaic trisomy 13 and constitutional delay in puberty (CDP).\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A young, pleasant boy was first seen at the age of 14 years as his parents were concerned about his pubertal development and size of genitalia. He is a product of non-consanguineous parents and had a normal natal and postnatal history. He did not suffer from any chronic medical illness and was not on any long-term medications. Growth developmental milestones were normally attained and had a good scholastic performance. There is no family history of delayed puberty or any endocrine problems.\n\n【8】On examination: height 166 cm (slightly below 50th percentile), weight 61.1 kg (75th percentile) . He had normal facial features and a normal sense of smell. Sexual maturity scores revealed microgenitalia: stretched penile length (SPL) 4 cm and bilaterally small testes 5 ml, axillary and pubic hair tanner stage 2, no gynecomastia. Systemic examination was unremarkable, apart from kyphosis.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Growth chart: height and weight.</u>\n\n【10】At a chronological age of 14, bone age corresponded to 12 years, thereby indicating a delayed bone age . General laboratory investigations were all normal. Baseline hormonal assay collected in the morning time including luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.5 mIU/ml (1.7–8.6), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) 1.2 mIU/l (1.5–12.4), testosterone level 0.8 nmol/l (0.98–38.5) and free androgen index 2.5 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–150)</u>, all of which were below normal range. The rest of pituitary evaluation, including IGF-1, Prolactin, Cortisol AM, TSH were all normal. These findings were suggestive of either CDP or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|X-ray hand: bone age.</u>\n\n【12】In patients suspected with HH chromosomal analysis to exclude congenital causes of delayed puberty is recommended. Karyotyping revealed Mos 47, XY, +13, with two cell lines: 87% of the cells having normal karyotype and the remainder with 47 chromosomes including an additional chromosome 13. Further cytogenic analysis using fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization confirmed the above observation revealing 23% cells with Trisomy 13 (161/700 cells) . Given the karyotype result, an echocardiography was done, which ruled out any cardiac abnormality.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Karyotype: mosaic trisomy 13.</u>\n\n【14】GnRH testing is generally used to differentiate between CDP and HH. The LH response to GnRH in boys with CDP usually exceeds that of HH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. In one report LH level exceeding 5.3 U/l is associated with progression in testicular volume and penile size. Following a GnRH stimulation test: LH showed an increase of up to 16 mIU/ml, FSH 9.3 mIU/L and testosterone 2.4 nmol/l. These findings are in favor of CDP. Further workup included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Sella that showed a normal-sized pituitary gland, no supra or para-sellar masses .\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|GnRH stimulation test\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\nTable 1|删除段之间换行|GnRH stimulation test\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n|   |\n| --- |\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Normal MRI brain.</u>\n\n【22】The patient was diagnosed with CDP, and given the size of the genitalia, he was started on a small permissive dose of testosterone (50 mg of testosterone decanoate) monthly for 3 months to assist with sexual maturity. He was advised to adopt a healthier lifestyle by incorporating more physical activity and followed up for 4 years. No further intervention was needed as he continued to show significant improvement in sexual maturity as well as hormonal profiles. He showed normal attainment of height, weight, muscle bulk and reached puberty by the age of 17. Latest physical examination findings showed SPL of 14 cm, testicular volume of 18–20 ml and tanner stage 4 for axillary and pubic hair.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】Trisomy 13 is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing multiple malformations including central nervous system, cardiac and urogenital anomalies. Characteristic features of Trisomy 13 include microphthalmia or anophthalmia, cleft lip and palate, and polydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The median survival time for patients with Trisomy 13 is 7–10 days, approximately 86–91% of live-born patients with this syndrome do not survive beyond the first year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, survival beyond the first year of life has been associated with mosaicism, which accounts 5% of these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The phenotype and outcome of mosaic trisomy 13 is at present poorly understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The most common cause of delayed puberty is attributed to constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a self-limiting condition in which puberty starts later than usual but shows normal progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient presented at the age of 14 with microgenitalia, slightly delayed bone age and initially low testosterone level but eventually showed a gradual progression in growth. He remained within the 50th percentile for his weight and height and attained normal sexual maturation by the age of 17. He had no other congenital anomalies that are commonly associated with Patau and had a normal intellectual function.\n\n【26】We were able to trace one case report of a 20-year-old male with Patau syndrome and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). This patient presented with lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics and normal height, clinical features and biochemical parameters associated with IHH. Clinical findings commonly associated with trisomy 13 were absent in this patient. MRI brain showed a normal olfactory bulb and tract but shallow olfactory sulcus and Karyotyping revealed two cell lines: one showing deletion of chromosome 13 at band 13p10.8 and another showing trisomy 13 with homologous Robertsonian translocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】To the best of our knowledge, there has been a single case report to link trisomy 13 to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; however, there were no previous case reports that linked mosaic trisomy 13 to CDP. In summary, there could be a possible association between mosaic trisomy 13 and CDP which may present in the form of hypogonadism, and in the presence of supporting clinical evidence, trisomy 13 should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of delayed puberty.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no financial relationships relevant to this article to disclose.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from patients’ parent.

Some of the circumstances that make identification more complex are bundle branch block patterns.

We present a patient with anteroseptal ST-segment elevation (STEMI), total AV block (TAVB) with ventricular escape rhythm RBBB pattern, and then turned into a LBBB pattern. Fortunately, it immediately turned into sinus rhythm after reperfusion therapy. It is essential to be able to identify STEMI in patients with BBB patterns. In addition, to provide the best possible outcomes for the patient, we must understand that the best way to manage STEMI with TAVB is to immediately install a temporary pacemaker and initiate reperfusion therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Accurate and rapid identification of acute coronary occlusion is critical for determining emergency reperfusion therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Electrocardiography (ECG) is the fastest bedside tool to help identify it, but ECG is not without its limitations. Some conditions that make identification more complex are bundle branch block patterns such as left or right bundle branch block (LBBB/RBBB) or ventricular escape rhythm. ST elevation in RBBB can still be detected, but LBBB must use specific criteria such as Sgarbossa and Barcelona. These criteria are essential because an ECG of a patient with LBBB can show changes in the ST segment (elevation or depression) even though the patient does not have ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In this case, we report exciting points of ECG learning. The patient experienced acute anteroseptal STEMI, total AV block (TAVB) with escape ventricular rhythm RBBB morphology, then LBBB morphology, and returned to sinus rhythm immediately after reperfusion.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A man in his late 40s was referred to our emergency department (ED) for reperfusion. Six hours prior to his previous hospitalization, he had sudden, persistent chest pain (pain rating of 5/10), diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Total AV block with RBBB pattern escape rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads (V1–V4) were observed on an ECG from the previous hospital . Due to his unstable hemodynamic and severe bradycardia, he was given a 5 μg/min epinephrine infusion. At our ED, he was still experiencing chest pain (pain scale 4/10) with an onset time of 10 hours, stable hemodynamics with vasoactive support and the same ECG pattern. While waiting for an RT-PCR COVID-19 swab test (pandemic era), a percutaneous attachment temporary pacemaker (TPM) and thrombolytic strategy were implemented. A post-thrombolytic ECG revealed a total AV block with LBBB pattern escape rhythm . Alterations in hemodynamics, such as a decrease in hemodynamic status followed by a sign of shock, coincide with the ECG changes. As soon as negative COVID-19 screening result was obtained, the patient was immediately transferred to the Cath Lab for rescue PCI and transvenous pacemaker placement. The coronary angiography revealed that the right coronary arteries (RCAs) and left anterior descendent (LAD) had critical stenosis (99%) in the middle , and the LAD had significant stenosis (80%) in the distal . A cardiac arrest episode occurred during RCA’s angiography, and we immediately did cardiopulmonary resuscitation for less than 3 minutes. After the patient had regained spontaneous circulation, we decided to finish the reperfusion by opening the RCA and LAD segment. Each sirolimus eluting stent (SES) was successfully placed in the osteal-mid RCA with two overlapping SES, and the proximal-mid LAD with two overlapping SES in order to achieve TIMI Flow III. After the procedure, the ECG with the pacemaker on standby showed a return of the TAVB with RBBB pattern . After 24 hours post revascularization, the patient’s ECG changed significantly to sinus rhythm and normal axis without any intraventricular block . We removed the TPM on the second day of hospitalization. He was discharged after the seventh day of hospitalization.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The patient’s ECG at the previous hospital showed total AV block with RBBB pattern escape rhythm, and ST-segment elevation in anteroseptal leads (V1–V4).</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|The patient’s post-thrombolytic ECG showed total AV block with LBBB pattern escape rhythm.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Diagnostic coronary angiography (DCA) showed that the right coronary arteries (RCAs) had critical stenosis 99% in the middle segment.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|DCA showed LAD with critical stenosis of 99% in the middle segment and significant stenosis of 80% in the distal segment.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Patient’s ECG after successfully performing complete revascularization procedure and installing a temporary pacemaker.

Ninety percent of patients with nodal, supra-Hisian or lesions above the bundle of His have occlusion of the RCA segment or inferior myocardial wall. The escape rhythm manifested in these lesions exhibits a narrow QRS complex, either reversible or transient, and the patient is expected to recover within a week. Patients with this ailment typically have asymptomatic bradycardia (40–60 beats per minute) and low mortality risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In comparison, intranodal or infra-Hisian lesions (distal to the AV node) are associated with occlusion in the LAD segment or anterior wall of the myocardium. This lesion manifests an escape rhythm characterized by a wide QRS complex and occurs within 24 hours. The development of a new BBB at this lesion suggests a significant anterior infarction with an extremely high mortality rate (80%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition, TAVB due to acute LAD occlusion will provide BBB/hemiblock pattern to describe the extent of MI. As in our case, the ventricular escape rhythm that appears had a RBBB pattern initially. Although the existence of RBBB may confound the diagnosis of STEMI, it is not too difficult to diagnose. Immediately after thrombolysis, the ECG changed to LBBB ventricular escape rhythm pattern. Interestingly, additional ECG observations revealed that it did not meet the diagnostic criteria for STEMI in LBBB. Sgarbossa _et al_ . have three criteria for diagnosis of acute MI with LBBB: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> ST-segment, elevation ≥1 mm in any lead with positive QRS (V4, V5, V6, Lead 1 and AVL); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> ST-segment depression ≥1 mm in V1, V2, and V3 and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ST-segment elevation ≥5 mm in any lead with discordant QRS (V1, V2, V3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Several case reports have also reported alternating BBB. This may be related to variances in the origin of ventricular impulses and the duration of the conduction branch refractory periods during the R-R interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Treatment for patients with electrical instability due to bundle branch block is TPM placement, and for patients with cardiogenic shock due to coronary artery occlusion is reperfusion. These two procedures are the cornerstone of treatment for patients diagnosed with STEMI and BBB. After undergoing these two main procedures, the patient’s clinical and hemodynamic status continued to improve. On the second day of the patient’s hospitalization, there was an improvement in heart rhythm to sinus rhythm with narrow QRS and thus no longer a BBB pattern. However, ST-segment elevation was still seen in leads V1-V5 of the patient’s ECG. As the patient’s hemodynamics improved, vasoactive support was no longer needed. Furthermore, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the seventh day of the hospitalization with oral therapy including high-intensity statins and dual antiplatelet drugs.

We describe an unusual case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow tract obstruction in a patient with renal carcinoma.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department complaining chest discomfort and dyspnea. His cardiovascular history was unremarkable except for smoking and emphysema. Seven weeks earlier, because of persistent fever, cough and evidence of anemia, he had undergone chest–abdomen computed tomography (CT), with evidence of a solid mass (7 × 6.5 cm) in the left kidney. Brain CT scan, bone scintigraphy, colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy had shown no significant findings. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had been submitted to left radical nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. An echocardiogram performed at the time of the intervention had shown no significant abnormalities. The patient had been discharged 6 days after surgery, with the recommendation of continuing enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, lansoprazole, folic acid and antalgic treatment with oxycodone/naloxone and paracetamol/codeine.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was in poor general conditions, his pulse rate was 135 beats/min, and blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood examinations showed leucocytosis (23.29×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: 4.40–10.10×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), anemia (Hb 8.8 g/dL, normal range: 13.2–17.0 g/dL), thrombocytosis (734×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: <150–400×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), and increased C-reactive protein (46.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia–hypocapnia. Ultrasound examination showed no evidence of venous thrombosis. Echocardiography showed a large mass (56 × 33 mm) attached to the anterior wall of the RV outflow tract, characterized by irregular shape, inhomogeneous echogenicity, and no evidence of vascularization . Doppler examination of RV outflow tract showed a peak subpulmonary gradient of 21 mmHg at rest. During forced expiration, the peak gradient increased up to 35 mmHg , suggesting dynamic RV outflow obstruction. There were also right atrial and ventricular enlargement with preserved systolic function (TAPSE 24 mm, tricuspid s’ 19 cm/s), severe tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension (52 mmHg), and reduced inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava. CT pulmonary angiography  confirmed the presence of a large mass obstructing the RV outflow tract, with irregular shape and no evidence of vascularization, suggesting RV thrombus. There were no emboli in the pulmonary vessels, but multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases were observed. No thrombosis was found in the systemic veins. Because of the recent history of surgery and the oncological prognosis, thrombolysis or surgery were not indicated. The patient was hospitalized and therapy with full-dose enoxaparin, fluids, antibiotics and steroids was started. Ten days after admission, an echocardiogram showed no significant changes, except for a mild improvement in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (moderate) and a slight reduction in mass dimensions (52 × 30 mm) and RV outflow tract gradient at rest (16 mmHg). The patient was discharged 1 week later on anticoagulation, but died 2 days thereafter.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Echocardiographic images showing the right ventricular mass  from the long-axis parasternal view ( **A** ), short-axis parasternal views ( **B** and **C** ), and parasternal right ventricular inflow view ( **D** ).

The detection of an isolated RV thrombus is a relatively rare event in patients with preserved RV systolic function, particularly when not associated with concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. Isolated RV thrombi have been reported in the setting of RV myocardial infarction and arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, Beçhet disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While neoplasms are associated with a thrombophilic state that increases the risk of cardiovascular events, isolated RV thrombi in cancer patients have been rarely described, in most cases resulting from extensive tumor-thrombus venous propagation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This report describes a case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to RV outflow tract obstruction following left radical nephrectomy in a patient with renal carcinoma. Several atypical aspects should be pointed out in this case. First, the clinical presentation with acute heart failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Second, the lack of thrombotic involvement of the systemic venous district, which in cancer patients commonly represents the pathway for thrombus propagation to the right ventricle. Third, the development of a large RV thrombus despite an apparently appropriate dose of enoxaparin, equal to that currently recommended by the 2014 ASCO guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Lastly, the evidence of a rapid thrombus formation despite preserved RV systolic function, which highlights the importance of thrombophilic states in the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On the other hand, although the echocardiographic and CT characteristics of the mass support its thrombotic nature, autopsy was not performed, so that no histological confirmation is available. Contrast echocardiography is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses, and could have provided additional information about the avascularity of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It is also worthy of note that, for patients with no evidence of a concomitant acute cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism), to date there are no specific guidelines for the management of intracardiac thrombi, and the relative efficacy of anticoagulation, thrombolysis or other approaches is still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Lastly, while the negativity of CT angiography makes the hypothesis of concomitant pulmonary embolism unlikely, this possibility cannot be completely excluded.\n\n【13】We believe that these issues could suggest clinical implications. The possibility of a RV outflow obstruction due to an isolated thrombus should be considered in patients with acute RV failure, even when there is no concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. This may be particularly important in patients with neoplasms or other conditions associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Bedside echocardiography plays a fundamental role for prompt assessment in this context. Lastly, the effectiveness of standard prophylactic doses of enoxaparin might be reduced in patients with prothrombotic states.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding for this article.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not needed for this type of article.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent to publish this case was obtained.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors are the guarantors of this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:15", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:52:30", "cost": 15.223}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:52:15"}

Organophosphates are commonly used in households worldwide and are a common cause of childhood poisonings. This case report describes an unintentional ingestion of a child in East Africa. A thorough patient history and a high index of suspicion are needed in recognizing an organophosphate poisoning. Prompt patient stabilization and treatment improve outcomes. Neurologic sequela may occur and thus patient follow-up is recommended.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Unintentional ingestions are common worldwide in children and adults. Most cases in children are unintentional and are due to the ingestion of a liquid. Organophosphate insecticides are readily available worldwide and cause irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the blood and nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The body is unable to break down acetylcholine without acetylcholinesterase causing an accumulation which results in a cholinergic toxidrome. These symptoms are similar in children and adults and can appear 3 to 12 h after ingestion. Symptoms include bradycardia, miosis, lacrimation, salivation and bronchospasm.\n\n【4】Bronchoconstriction and central nervous system depression cause respiratory failure and severe poisonings may lead to myocardial ischemia. Long-term sequelae such as neuropathy and neurobehavioral deficits can occur weeks after ingestion. For this reason, follow-up is recommended.\n\n【5】Although data are sparse, it is known that organophosphate poisonings are a frequent cause of emergency admissions to hospital in developing countries, especially in South-East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In addition, it was estimated in 2010 that around 200 000 deaths occur annually worldwide due to intentional ingestion of organophosphates (suicide attempt) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Here, we describe a case of unintentional ingestion by a child in East Africa.\n\n【6】PATIENT INFORMATION\n-------------------\n\n【7】A previously healthy child under 5 years of age with no other health conditions developed weakness and lost consciousness at home after ingesting approximately 6 ml of pesticide powder diluted in water. The ingestion occurred 2–3 h prior to arrival to the hospital. The unlabeled ingested powder used as a pesticide was brought to the health facility by the family.\n\n【8】CLINICAL FINDINGS\n-----------------\n\n【9】The child’s vital signs upon arrival were a heart rate of 130 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20b/m and random blood sugar 442 mg/dl, with an illegible pulse oximeter. He weighed 9.6 kg.\n\n【10】THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION\n------------------------\n\n【11】Emergency treatment included 150 ml Ringer’s Lactate bolus, cimetidine 400 mg IV and atropine 1 mg IV. Cardiorespiratory arrest ensued, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation and respiration after 4 min. A gastric lavage was attempted, but quickly halted due to concerns of aspiration.\n\n【12】Stabilization continued with atropine 0.02 mg/kg (0.2 mg) every 10–20 min for a total of 1 mg, due to ongoing signs of organophosphate poisoning including miosis, increased secretions and a brief self-terminating seizure.\n\n【13】Within 24 h the child had returned to his normal cognition and was off oxygen. He was discharged home the next day. Attempts to contact the child’s family for follow-up were not successful and the mission closed some 6–8 weeks later.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Ingestions are common in children. Successful recovery from organophosphate poisoning is based on time from ingestion to initial presentation, rapid stabilization and definitive treatment with atropine.\n\n【16】Recommended atropine dosing is 0.02–0.05 mg/kg repeated every 5–10 min until symptoms resolve. In this case atropine was administered gradually, every 15–20 min, out of concern for adverse reactions with good resolution of signs and symptoms.\n\n【17】Prophylactic diazepam has been suggested in the literature to decrease neurocognitive dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although diazepam was not administered to our patient (since the seizure was self-resolving), no immediate neurological concerns were observed. Lessons learned from this case include the importance of prompt identification of the ingested substance, and the need for follow-up to assess for long-term neurological deficits. The unlabeled powder in this case was identified as an organophosphate due to prior similar cases in this health facility and the child’s initial presentation (especially increased oral secretions).\n\n【18】Gastric lavages are not recommended as they can cause aspiration.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】In face of typical symptoms such as those described for our patient, there should be a high suspicion of organophosphate exposure even when the patient or his/her family is not aware of it. Although not used in this case diazepam administration can be considered to decrease complications. Understanding proper management of ingestion cases is essential for the successful treatment of poisonings, notably in children.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Claire Kilbride MD (ER physician on Mission).</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nadia Lafferty MD.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Marta A Balinska, PhD MPH (medical writing services).</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was funded entirely by MSF.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:28", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:37", "cost": 9.122}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:28"}

The procedure and difficulties involved in the clinical diagnosis of ALS have been the subject of numerous investigations. The understanding of the genetics and the epigenetics of the disease is still at infancy with several missing links. We present a case report of a 73-year-old woman suffering from bulbar onset ALS with a 4-month history of progressive dysphagia and dyspnea. She displayed tongue fasciculations and muscle atrophy. The bilateral palmomental reflexes, snout reflex, Hoffman, Babinski, diminished gag reflex, bilateral clonus and wild mood swings confirmed the neurodegenerative condition of the patient. The diagnosis of ALS can be challenging; therefore, the data presented may be useful to investigate its characteristics of the onset and to improve the understanding of the aspects of differentiation from other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The neurological condition known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, or motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive condition that affects the nerve cells that regulate voluntary muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. ALS is still considered one of the rare diseases and its incidence worldwide is 2.7–5 cases per 100 000 population annually. The patient’s growing weakening, manifested as muscular atrophy, hyperreflexia, fasciculations and muscle cramps, is the most striking feature of the disease. However, the sensory function remains unaffected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We describe a case of ALS presenting bulbar onset with neurodegeneration, dysarthria and dysphagia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension arrived at our neurology clinic complaining of speech difficulties and voice changes that had been going on for ⁓4 months. During the assessment, the patient displayed dysarthria and slurred speech. She had trouble swallowing both liquid and solid food and was constantly drooling. Her respiratory function was preserved. Upon examination, the patient displayed tongue fasciculations that were more noticeable on the left lateral side. The left hemibody showed more signs of atrophy in the thenar and hypothenar eminences, and the interosseous muscles of the hands. The biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris muscles both had clear fasciculations. The patient had a broad decline in muscle strength that scored 4/5 in the right hemibody and 3/5 in the left. The clinical examination revealed enhanced osteotendinous reflexes in the four limbs. The bilateral palmomental reflex was more pronounced on the left side. The patient also presented a snout reflex. In the left hemibody, Hoffman, Babinski and more obvious bilateral clonus were found. On pharyngeal examination, the gag reflex was not elicited, the left side palate was slightly dropped and the uvula showed deviation to the right. The differential and erythrocyte sedimentation rates on the hemogram were unaltered. Creatine phosphatase (CPK) measured 380 U/I. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) scans of the skull and spine revealed no abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord. Fibrillations, positive sharp waves and fasciculations were detected spontaneously by electromyography in the investigated muscles (biceps, pronator teres, spinal cord and tibialis anterior). The notching and enhanced polyphasic amplitude of the motor unit potentials were visible.\n\n【6】In the differential diagnosis, entities that affected the first and second motor neurons were assessed from compressive causes in the stem and spinal cord, intoxications, demyelinating diseases and primary lateral sclerosis. Cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF) showed an albumin-cytological dissociation with a protein of 151 mg/dl and the cell count of 2/mm <sup>3 </sup> . CSF oligoclonal band study was negative. Acetyl cholinesterase receptor antibodies and anti-muscle specific kinase antibodies were negative, ruling out the possibility of myasthenia gravis. The serological testing of cytomegalovirus using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) classes was negative. Thus diagnosis of bulbar onset ALS was made based on clinical, serological, CSF and electophysiological findings. The patient was put on symptomatic and supportive treatment with neuroprotective agents: Riluzol, Vitamin E and co-enzyme Q10. General measures were provided with gentle rehabilitation, amantadine and psychological support. At follow up visits, the patient had shown rapid functional deterioration and decline in life quality.\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】ALS, referred to as classic MND, impacts motor neurons on both the upper and lower limbs. Typical bulbar onset ALS patients develop progressive limb symptoms within first 6 months. Patients with a duration of >20 months from bulbar onset to first significant limb involvement are more likely to have isolated bulbar palsy (IBP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with bulbar onset ALS had poor prognosis and the disease course and survival time was significantly shorter. Early signs of bulbar onset ALS typically include bulbar muscles. Individuals gradually lose their strength, ability to speak, eat, move and even breathe, and practically all of the muscles they can control voluntarily become afflicted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Within 2–3 years for cases of bulbar onset ALS and 3–5 years for patients with limb onset ALS, the paralysis progresses and results in death due to respiratory failure. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 55 and 75, while the disease can strike at any age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The patient in this case had both lower motor neuron (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) bulbar signs. While Karam et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> found no evidence of a significant difference between UMN and LMN bulbar signs between the two groups, Burrel _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> discovered that UMN bulbar signs were more prevalent in IBP.\n\n【10】ALS presents with significant clinical heterogeneity. The most common causes of diagnostic delays in ALS are frequent referrals to specialists, misdiagnosis, the location of disease onset, age at which it first manifests and comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The trait of female gender predominance in bulbar onset ALS suggests that genetic factors may be involved. Most ALS cases have been described as sporadic, and more research on the pathophysiology and genetic susceptibility of ALS is required.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the available data has been presented in the manuscript.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ajay Singh.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:40:29", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:41:05", "cost": 35.345}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:28", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:41:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:40:26"}

The earliest detectable abnormality in TA is a thickening of the vessel wall, but diffuse aortic wall calcification is very rare and is a late manifestation. Besides, the involvement of the coronary arteries is not a common finding in TA and frequently involves the right coronary artery (RCA). Multi-modality imaging has a fundamental role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and its complications. In this report, we want to present an unusual case with TA, diffuse aortic wall calcification and left main coronary artery ostial lesion, which is a rare combination.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu Arteritis (TA) is a type of vasculitis affecting aorta and its major branches, thought to result from an autoimmune process that targets large elastic-containing arteries. TA affects women eight times more frequently than men. Chronic inflammation of the vessel walls leads to aneurysm formation, stenosis or thrombosis. Cardiac involvement occurs eventually in nearly one-third of patients. Myocarditis also occurs in TA and causes potentially reversible congestive heart failure (CHF). Conventional angiography is invasive and provides the least sensitive method for visualizing wall thickness. Ultrasonography, and to a lesser degree, computed tomography (CT) can detect this early vessel wall thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can identify vessel wall thickening, stenosis, as well as aneurysm formation. Additionally, multi-parametric cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging assists in determining cardiac involvement, including myocarditis. In this article, we want to present a new case of TA with atypical features including diffuse aortic wall calcification, left main (LM) coronary artery ostial thickening, as well as myocarditis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old man, from Mazandaran, Iran referred to our hospital with a 4-month history of palpitation and dyspnea (NYHA functional class II). The patient had no medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. Also, no history of smoking or alcohol use, as well as shortness of breath and chest pain and angina symptoms during exercise was detected. However, he had a history of sudden cardiac death in his brother at the age of 37 years old, with no evaluation. Moreover, he had no evidence of arthralgia, fever, headache or dermatologic manifestation at the time of presentation. On clinical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg in both upper limbs, pulses were easily palpable, and there were no bruits. A systolic murmur with an intensity of II/VI heard at the apex and a diastolic murmur also heard in the aortic position with III/VI intensity. Furthermore, a small left cervical lymphadenopathy (short-axis diameter: 10 mm) was detected with no erythema or pain.\n\n【6】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, wright, coombs wright, 2-mercaptoethanol, the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests, lipid profile, liver function test and thyroid hormone levels were within a normal range. Notably, his hemoglobin level was 12.5 g/dl.\n\n【7】Since some researches have suggested an overlap between tuberculosis and TA, tuberculin test, sputum smear and culture for mycobacterium was carried out, which were all negative.\n\n【8】The echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with global left ventricular (LV) hypokinesia, mild LV enlargement, and moderate mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves regurgitation. To evaluate the coronary arteries, CT angiography was performed, which determined diffuse media thickening of the aortic root (5 mm), and a significant narrowing of the LM ostium . Besides, it displayed evidence of aneurysmal dilation of ascending aorta with extensive aortic wall calcification along its course . In this regard, coronary angiography confirmed CT results .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|CT and angiography in TA.

The patient had two children and agreed to take the drug. However, we sent the patient’s sperm to the sperm bank for storage. Subsequently, treatment with injectable methotrexate at a dose of 20 mg per week continued. Due to CHF, anti-TNF drugs were not appropriate for the patient.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】TA is an idiopathic vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its branches, which results in the increased wall thickness of arteries, fibrosis, stenosis, aneurysmal formation or dilation, and thrombosis. In this report, we present an interesting case of TA diagnosed with a multi-modality imaging approach that had a combination of LM coronary artery involvement, entire aortic wall calcification, significant stenosis of the celiac trunk, and myocarditis, which is a rare combination in TA. Signs and symptoms characterizing the vascular inflammatory stage include, but not limited to, fatigue, fever, malaise, palpitation, headache, rash, hemoptysis and weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, disease activity may persist in the aortic wall, despite the patient being asymptomatic and all inflammatory markers may remain within normal limits. Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a marker of long-standing inflammation in TA, which is a very rare finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Coronary arteries, like other aortic branches, are involved in TA in 6–30% of cases. The right coronary artery is the most affected one. The most common site of coronary artery involvement is the ostium and proximal segments of the right and left coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The optimal coronary revascularization method for Takayasu patients is not known yet. Wong _et al._ concluded that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is better than percutaneous coronary intervention because the restenosis rate and major adverse cardiovascular events are more in PCI procedure than the CABG. More than a 9-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in the percutaneous procedure than CABG reported in this study. On the other hand, CABG in patients with TA has many difficulties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Because the left subclavian and internal mammary arteries are commonly affected, a saphenous vein graft is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. For the first time, Kuijer _et al._ reported a case in which a Dacron prosthetic patch utilize to insert the proximal anastomosis on an inflamed aorta. The patch prevented contact between inflamed tissue and the graft. They believe that in this way, the risk of graft failure will be reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Oishi _et al._ reported successful repair of ostial coronary artery stenosis using a femoral artery patch in Takayasu arteritis. It would be a reasonable surgical method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Therefore, three common surgical approaches are CABG, patch angioplasty of the LM coronary artery ostium, and transaortic coronary ostial endarterectomy. Although surgery is prohibited during the active stage of the inflammation, in a patient with unstable angina, it is applicable.\n\n【21】Hybrid CABG is an alternative technique. Preoperative stent insertion and subsequent off-pump CABG perform in the hybrid method. In the presence of the macroscopic calcification of the ascending aorta, conventional CABG is not the preferred technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thus, the Hybrid procedure is useful in patients with porcelain aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. As an alternative method, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can perform in Takayasu’s disease. This procedure has been offered in high-risk patients who refuse surgery or have severe pulmonary hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Because of the underlying inflammation and the higher rate of in-stent restenosis, interventional therapy was more associated with the re-interventions rate than the surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a late and rare manifestation of Takayasu arteritis. Multi-modality imaging using cardiac CT and CMR has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and portrays its complications.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this study.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors mention that they have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to the data gathering and writing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study has ethical approval from the ethics committee of Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

In patients with cortical hearing loss (and in the absence of communication deficit, either total or partial, as in agnosia or aphasia), some attention-related or language-based disorders may lead to a wrong diagnosis of hearing impairment. The authors present two patients (8 and 11 years old) with no anatomical damage to the ear, the absence of neurological damage or trauma, but immature cortical auditory evoked potentials. Both patients presented a clinical history of multiple diagnoses over several years. Because the most visible symptom was moderate hearing loss, the patients were recurrently referred to audiological testing, with no improvement. This report describes the use of long-latency evoked potentials to determine cases of cortical hearing loss, where hearing impairment is a consequence of underdevelopment at the central nervous system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】We report two cases of centrally related hearing loss in children (8 and 11 years old) affected by an underdeveloped maturational processing in the primary auditory cortex that is initially observable through objective and subjective hearing impairment. Traditionally, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) have been used to obtain information of the area of the brain where the auditory cortex (primary and secondary) is located 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Long-latency evoked potentials (LLEPs) are said to relate to attention, memory and auditory discrimination skills 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We believe that LLEP is a robust test that can be applied to identify cortical hearing loss associated with immature central processing.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】An 8-year-old boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective hearing loss. The boy was initially diagnosed with a probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but no language-based learning disability had been found by a preliminary psychological assessment. A pure tone audiometry (250–4000 Hz) demonstrated thresholds of 45–60 dB hearing level (HL) for the right ear and 50–60 dB HL for the left ear . Tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) as well as crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflexes were normal. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. An EEG test to discard tumor/trauma showed normal results. A well-formed brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test was recorded bilaterally . Results in the perception test (identification of two-syllable words at different HL levels) proved 100% accuracy at 50 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 35 dB HL for the left ear. He then performed an LLEP test in three sweeps (80, 60 and 40 dB normal hearing level (nHL) tone bursts at 250–2000 Hz) in the right and left ears, alternatively, which shows the absence of CAEPs for the 40 dB nHL stimulation and polyphasic interwave morphology . The patient was widely awake during the procedure with eyes open.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|Audiogram and BAEP results for the 8-year-old child (on the left) and the 11-year-old child (on the right).

Latency values are delayed for all CAEPs. Even though similar wave morphology is observed at 60 dB nHL, CAEPs are not clearly found. At 60 and 40 dB nHL, interwave amplitude is polyphasic, with multiple periods between peaks, showing immature development according to the literature. ( **B** ) LLEP test for the 11-year-old boy.

Interwave morphology is very irregular, with multiple periods, which is not normal for pre-teen age. Cortical maturation of the older child is similar to the young boy, which recommends further neuropsychological testing.</u>\n\n【9】### Case 2\n\n【10】An 11-year-old boy presented at the Otorhinolaryngology day ward with a medical history of moderate language-based learning disorders. The boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective and subjective hearing loss. The patient had a previous pathology of bone dysplasia in the left malar. A pure tone audiometry showed normal hearing , the results of the tympanogram and TEOAE were normal and the acoustic reflexes (stapedius reflex) of the middle ear showed no anatomical disorder. Results in the perception test proved 100% accuracy at 40 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 50 dB HL for the left ear. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. Neurological history was complemented with a BAEP test, which proved normality . The LLEP test shows that waves with polyphasic morphology plus no CAEP could be identified for the 60 and 40 dB nHL stimulations . The recording of CAEPs occurs while the patient was awake with eyes open.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Recent studies increasingly use CAEPs as an early indicator of cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present the same method adapted to children to identify immature cortical development that may only be appreciated through moderate hearing loss. Patients in this report present no lesion on the temporal lobe or any other neurologically related pathology. There is no visible damage to the anatomy of the auditory system or the peripheral nervous system. They share a long clinical history and moderate language-based deficit and/or attention. We have used latency (ms) but not amplitude as the measure to classify CAEPs 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1, N1a, N1b, P2 and N2)</u>. Amplitude may not be an objective measure for the population described here because its objective value decreases with attention, so it does not seem appropriate for younger patients or patients with a suspicion of attention deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Maturational changes in CAEPs include decreases in latency and amplitude as well as dynamic morphological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We have observed that interwave amplitude decreases with stimulus intensity, which was predictable. However, polyphasic morphology (multiple periods between CAEPs) should not be present in children older than 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. This fact is so obvious that it prevents from the identification of specific CAEPs. The neural generators of P1 originate in the thalamus–cortical projections to the auditory cortex and may represent the first recurring activity in the cortex. The emergence of N1, on the other hand, has been compared with the maturation of axon neurofilaments and various critical stages in speech perception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We could assume then that both P1 and N1 reflect second-order processing of the auditory cortex. Normal values for P1 can be found ∼97 ms for 7–8 years and ∼77 ms for 11–12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, these values seem normal (78 ms) for the 8-year-old child and slightly late (89.5 ms) for the 11-year-old child. However, more clear is the emergence of double negativity represented by N1a and N1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Latencies are delayed for the rest of CAEPs. The P2 component measures were 291.5 ms in the case of the 8-year-old child and 312.65 ms for the 11-year-old child (vs. normal 150 ms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>). The N2 component is present in the two patients, with late latencies (∼400 ms for both patients). Studies have also shown that the N2 component may be used as an objective measure of temporal processing ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Normal values for N2 are 243 ms (for 8 years old) and 226 ms (for 11 years old).\n\n【14】Overall, the preliminary diagnosis of hearing impairment in these patients needs to be complemented as a case of cortical hearing loss. The case of the pre-teen is especially important because objective and subjective audiological testing discarded severe hearing impairment, yet LLEP test indicates similar late maturation when compared with the younger boy. These cases are becoming more recurring in our clinic, which advises for the use of LLEP for two reasons: first, to identify whether we are dealing with a case of cortical loss and secondly, to assess the need to complement with neuropsychological testing (in the absence of neurological trauma/pathology). In the cases reported, values of P1 (78 and 89.5 ms, respectively) were within the normal range, with double N1 component and late latencies for P2–N2 when compared with standard values (291.5 and 312.65 ms for P2, respectively, vs. normal 150 ms; ∼400 ms for N2 vs. normal 243–226 ms, respectively). CAEP amplitude was not considered, but the polyphasic morphology of the waves and the absence of some CAEPs at various intensity levels were used to demonstrate underdevelopment at the cortical area that advises for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【15】In conclusion, this case report gives evidence of two children who display some learning difficulties, as reported by caregivers and psychologists. The two children are initially diagnosed with light to moderate hearing loss by the delivery of subjective tests (pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry). However, TEOAE and immittance audiometry (stapedius reflex) proved normal for both patients. In the absence of any anatomical damage to the ear or neurological lesion/trauma as tested by CT scan and EEG, a combination of two electrophysiological tests (BAEP and LLEP) led to the final diagnosis of a centrally related hearing loss: with normal BAEP results, late latency in LLEP proved the lack of maturational central processes in both children, which coincide with psychological evidence. These results advise for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (FFI2010-18205) and the Secretary of State for Research, Development and Innovation.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Research presented in this manuscript has obtained ethical approval by Hospital Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, and University of Seville (Spain).</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Participants in this report and parents/tutors have been informed on details of the study, including benefits in participation, possible risks, right to leave without previous notice and all contact information from responsible researchers.

However, the clinical role of endothelial function tests in VSA-induced STEMI is not fully understood. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with atypical chest pain and no coronary risk factors. STEMI caused by VSA was diagnosed. Flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and EndPAT tests were performed; the FMD and reactive hyperaemia index were 3.8% and 1.23, respectively. Endothelial dysfunction is the putative cause of STEMI. FMD and EndPAT tests might be useful for predicting adverse outcomes in young premenopausal women with VSA.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronary artery vasospasm (VSA) can cause anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) which is relatively infrequent manifestation of myocardial infarction with nonobstractive coronary artery (MINOCA; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>). VSA has been reported to be more common in male smokers with significant coronary risk factors who are over the age of 50–60. VSA is less common among young adult premenopausal women.

Since understanding of the pathophysiology of STEMI in MINOCA, and provocative testing for VSA has not always been recommended in STEMI in MINOCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, it is extremely important to discuss the role of systemic endothelial function tests in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 43-year-old woman (158 cm, 41 kg) visited our outpatient clinic because of intermittent atypical chest wall pain lasting for > 20 min from the day before presentation. Pain was not associated with effort or any triggers. Present history revealed that pain was sharp and intermittently occurred for all day long. She first visited other clinics and was referred to our hospital the next day. She did not have chest pain or any other symptoms when she visited our outpatient clinic, her heart rate was 80 beats/min and regular and her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg. There were no risk factors for coronary artery disease. Relevant past medical history was negative, including the absence of any gynaecological problems and on no medications including birth control pills. She also denied a menstrual period at the time of the clinic visit and had a regular menstrual cycle. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V2–5 with super-acute tall T waves . The chest radiograph was normal. Laboratory data showed positive troponin T (>0.1 ng/ml; TROP T sensitive R \\[Roche Diagnostic Inc. Tokyo, Japan\\]) and the other positive data were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 89 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 29 U/l; creatine phosphokinase, 758 U/l; white blood cell count, 10 500/μl and serial changes are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The other parameters were within the normal range. Echocardiography revealed segmental anterior severe hypokinesis, and Takotubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis were excluded. Emergency coronary angiography showed no significant stenotic lesions. Before angiography, aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel sulphate 300 mg were orally administered as standard treatment for STEMI. However, a bolus injection of 100-μg acetylcholine into the left coronary descending artery revealed 90% occlusion of the proximal portion of the artery, which was relieved by intra-coronary nitroglycerin injection. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) was diagnosed due to coronary spasm . The clinical course was stable with administration of a calcium antagonist (benidipine hydrochloride 4 mg b.i.d) and aspirin (100 mg, q.d.). About 3 months after MI episode, flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD, measured by EF18G; UNEX, Nagoya, Japan) and peripheral tonometry of EndPAT tests were performed (reactive hyperaemia index \\[RHI\\], measured by EndPAT2000 system \\[Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel\\]) after washing out of medication around 2 p.m. As a result, the FMD and RHI were 3.8% and 1.23, respectively . Endothelial dysfunction was observed. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Serial changes in 12-lead ECG.

These changes are endothelial cell dependent. ( **D** ) EndPAT2000 measurement is another method of assessing endothelial function. It is a reactive hyperaemia-peripheral tonometry test. It mainly reflects not only nitric oxide but also endothelium-dependent hyperpolarising factor and prostacyclin. This method measures blood flow changes by reactive hyperaemia and endothelial function, and is similar to FMD. After the upper arm occlusion by cuff with a pressure above either systolic pressure of 60 or 200 mmHg for 5 min, the cuff was released. The measurement of both index fingers’ blood flow by tonometry throughout the study was performed. Reactive hyperaemia-related endothelial-dependent blood flow increase was measured. Based on the measurement of the flow of both fingers, suspected artefacts are cancelled and real blood flow increase can be detected, as shown in . A comparison between before and after reactive hyperaemia is conducted in hyperaemia-induced finger and is adjusted by comparing the flow changes of the other fingers. The ratio after/before (RHI) was then determined. If RHI was < 1.67, endothelial dysfunction was diagnosed. In this case, endothelial dysfunction was observed. Same as RHI method, hyperaemia-related endothelial-dependent brachial artery diameter vasodilatation was measured by ultrasound in FMD. This vasodilatation is mainly caused by endothelial-dependent nitric oxide release. FMD, flow-mediated vasodilatation; RHI, reactive hyperaemia index. FMD < 4.0% and RHI < 1.67 are significantly abnormal.</u>\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】The main features of this patient were as follows: first, VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA in a premenopausal young adult woman without gynaecological problems; second, no significant coronary risk factors or organic comorbidity; third, complaint of atypical chest pain; and finally, impaired endothelial function revealed by FMD and RHI.\n\n【13】In this case, VSA-induced STEMI due to VSA was diagnosed, and abnormal endothelial function tests were performed. In young premenopausal women complaining of chest pain, VSA, coronary artery microvascular dysfunction, coronary artery dissection, Takotubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis are important disorders to consider in the differential diagnosis and these were excluded in this case. Coronary endothelial dysfunction has been well investigated for the possible pathophysiology of VSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. FMD and RHI were measured in the afternoon and in the fasting phase as well as the appropriate menstrual phase. In the settings where the confounding factors influencing endothelial function and the diurnal variation of endothelial function in VSA were taken into account 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; her endothelial function was the most likely aetiological factor. In the chronic phase of her clinical course, when STEMI did not influence the endothelial function test, FMD and RHI showed significant endothelial dysfunction. FMD was < 4.0%, while RHI was < 1.67, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】A previous study showed that decreased FMD and RHI reflect adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease, and FMD could possibly be a significant modality for diagnosing coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, reports on the prognostic and diagnostic values of FMD and RHI in VSA are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, where significantly lower FMD and RHI values were observed, the important role of systemic endothelial function in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA might be significant. In addition, among the calcium antagonists that are first-line medications for VSA, we chose benidipine hydrochloride according to a previous report, and the patient’s condition was stable under this medication. If benidipine is not available, either nifedipine of 40 mg or diltiazem of 200 mg daily is acceptable therapy, and no further treatments except aspirin were necessary because any risk factors did not exist.\n\n【15】Since this case showed relatively atypical chest symptoms and most patients with VSA have been reported to be asymptomatic or have an atypical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, the supplemental use of either FMD or RHI in already diagnosed VSA for predicting subsequently developing STEMI could be indicated. In addition, according to the findings of this case, the prognostic value of either FDM or RHI in VSA-induced STEMI in MINOCA should be prospectively investigated. This kind of study would be worth conducting in the near future. This case provides a clue to the above-mentioned concept.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest pertaining to any authors.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for this report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for this publication.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:01", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:16", "cost": 15.386}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:01"}

Previous reports have described it as a useful tool in high risk patients in need of intravascular material resection. Here we present a unique and never reported case of AngioVac device thrombectomy use in a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and gastrointestinal bleed that contraindicated other thrombectomy therapies due to severe anemia and high bleeding risk. A brief literature review about this therapy and its main outcomes is presented to contextualize the reader and contribute to academic knowledge.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Right heart masses are considered a life-threatening condition due to a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Masses found to be thrombi are rare and have various etiologies such as thrombosed central veins or central venous catheter-associated masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Non-thrombotic causes are usually related to metastatic lesions from tumors of the liver, lungs, mediastinum and melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Admission electrocardiogram.</u>\n\n【5】Diagnosis is based on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), however its sensibility and specificity for differentiating between clots, myxomas, fibromas and fatty tissue is limited, hence, additional imaging is usually required, such as contrast perfusion transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or TEE. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan have similar sensitivity but greater specificity compared to TTE at defining the etiology of the cardiac mass and may be useful for differentiating between malignant, vascular and stromal tumors from thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Once the diagnosis is made, treatment is rapidly targeted with different therapies as pharmacological thrombolysis, surgical mechanical thrombectomy and mechanical catheter-directed therapies as the AngioVac device. Choosing among these methods is still debated, retrospective studies have shown that patients with PE and free floating intra-cardiac thrombus benefit from surgical thrombectomy as opposed to thrombolysis alone. In those cases where surgery is contraindicated, thrombolytic therapy alone is an option if there is not a high bleeding or distal embolization risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Patients who are not eligible for those therapies or have a large clot burden are candidates for catheter thrombectomy with AngioVAC device, a novel promising therapy but with little available published experience and evidence. Here we present the case of a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) treated with AngioVac device. A brief literature review has been included for knowledge contribution to the reader.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 29-year-old Guatemalan male with significant past medical history of end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis, hypertension and 5 years use of indwelling tunneled central venous catheter presented to the emergency room due to a 5-day clinical onset of black stools and 1 day of acute moderate chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath at rest and dizziness. Vital signs were only remarkable for a blood pressure of 182/103 mmHg. At physical examination head, neck, lungs, heart and abdomen were normal. No blood per rectum or melena was found. Bilateral 2+ lower extremity pitting edema was noted.\n\n【10】Laboratory reports showed positive Troponin-I consecutive results of 4.58—4.56—4.19 ng/L and severe acute anemia with Hemoglobin (HgB) of 5.4 g/dl, EKG showed sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, left anterior fascicular block, poor R wave progression and no ST-segment changes . TTE was ordered. Blood cultures were positive for _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ . The patient’s chart showed last HgB level of 10.4 g/l 15 days before in prior admission.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Apical four-chamber view showing thrombus in right atrium (arrow) with mobile element (asterisk).</u>\n\n【12】Patient was diagnosed with acute UGB and type II non-ST Elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) secondary to acute HgB drop and catheter related sepsis (six points by SOFA); he was subsequently started on pantoprazole drip, beta blocker, rosuvastatin and three packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusions were given. Anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants were held because of UGB and pneumatic compression was ordered. Hemodialysis continued as usual and erythropoietin was administered. Vancomycin was started for treatment of _S. epidermidis_ bacteremia and endoscopy showed no bleeding, erythema or inflammatory changes suggestive of gastritis or ulceration in the entire examined stomach.\n\n【13】TTE demonstrated normal LVEF with a highly mobile, irregularly shaped echodensity (2.7 cm in maximum diameter) inside the right atrium (RA), suggestive of a catheter-associated thrombus . Due to high risk of embolization and sudden death risk he was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and cardio-thoracic surgery (CTS) was consulted.\n\n【14】CTS performed percutaneous removal under general anesthesia with Angiovac device because of bleeding risk of open thrombectomy. Intra-operative TEE showed no residual valve abnormalities and no remaining thrombus. After procedure, there were no immediate complications and patient remained in Surgical ICU for monitoring; 1 day later patient was extubated uneventfully. Pathology revealed calcified thrombus and negative culture growth. Patient was started on heparin anticoagulation on post-op Day 2, which was later bridged to warfarin 5 mg daily. He was then transferred to medical floor on post-op Day 3 and started ambulating without difficulties. HgB level increased to 8.3 g/dl following one more transfusion of pRBC. Patient was then discharged following several persistently negative blood cultures to complete 2-week course of outpatient vancomycin. Catheter was replaced for a right femoral vein one and patient continued with previous three times a week dialysis regimen.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Parasternal right ventricular inflow view showing mobile thrombus (arrow).</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Introduced in 2009, the AngioVac device is a vacuum-assisted thrombectomy system designed for _en bloc_ removal of large clot burden while avoiding bleeding and hemolysis risks associated with fibrinolytics, surgery and rheolytic systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Here we present a case of AngioVac use considered clinically relevant as this appears to be the first case of its use in a patient with an acute contraindication to anticoagulation.\n\n【18】In our literature review, a total of 45 cases of AngioVac use for thrombus aspiration was obtained including 15 cases of a single center case reports published by Donaldson _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> in 2015. In those 45 cases, main clinical manifestation was dyspnea in 13 cases, followed by incidental finding of the thrombi in six cases and palpitations in five, which is consistent with this presented case. The initial diagnosis was made by TEE in seven cases, not specified in nine cases, CT scan and venogram in seven and four cases, respectively. Only three cases were initially diagnosed by TTE as the one reported here 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–11 \\]</u>. In 15 cases, neither the clinical manifestations nor diagnostic approach was described. No report described UGB as a clinical finding.\n\n【19】The obtained material was removed from the inferior vena cava (IVC) in more than half of the cases, 11 of these cases had extent to RA. Only eight cases were isolated RA thrombi of which just six were related to catheters, consistent with epidemiologic data about rarity of RA thrombosis and highlighting the importance of the presented case. Obtained material consisted of thrombi in 80% of the cases, the remaining was associated to malignancy or vegetation. Only four cases reported a failed procedure and complications were reported in six cases with one septic emboli case and hematomas for the remaining five. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–11 \\]</u>. Particularly, in the Donaldson _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> case report, 11 cases had post-procedural bleeding of which five needed transfusions due to overt bleeding, and an overall 87% of survival to discharge was reported, which suggests the AngioVac thrombectomy as an overall safe procedure for those high surgical risk patients.\n\n【20】A recent meta-analysis by Hameed _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> was presented in 2019 with promising outcomes of this therapy. In this study, a total of 182 cases of AngioVac use were analyzed, of which 101 corresponded to thrombus removal. Successful removal pooled rate was 80.5 and 32.4 for right atrium/inferior vena cava (RA/IVC) thrombi and PE, respectively. As similar to the previously described cases, the need of conversion to open surgery had a low rate, with 12.3 pooled rate for thrombi removal. However operative mortality pooled rate was 14.8 and 32.3 for RA/IVC thrombi and PE, respectively, which should be taken into consideration when treating PE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】All this being said, percutaneous thrombectomy with AngioVac device is a promising therapy, which needs more complex trials to evaluate specific outcomes and to answer questions such as precise indications and contraindications of this intervention as well as complication and failure rates. Available reports and recent meta-analysis suggest AngioVac thrombectomy as a viable option for those high surgical risk patients with an inspiring high successful and low mortality rates except for those patients with PE, in which outcomes seem to be worse with this therapy.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>To all the healthcare professionals who participated in the care of this case.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We, as authors, declare that no institution participated on funding of this project.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>As this manuscript is based on the compilation of clinical record data and no clinical conduct was determined by the existence of it, we as authors consider no ethical approval other than patient’s informed consent is required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient was informed about our desire to publish the case and after cautious explanation about the contents of the manuscript, informed consent was signed.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hernan Leonardo Vera-Sarmiento, as main author is the guarantor of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:41:32", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:42:31", "cost": 58.198}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:42:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:41:32"}

On discontinuation of the PPIs, symptoms of LPR remained and the patient’s reflux symptoms returned with increased severity. Consumption of acacia gum exudates from _Acacia pycnantha_ resolved the LPR. _Acacia pycnantha_ or gum arabic were both found to reduced reflux symptoms to a manageable level. An evaluation of the therapeutic effect of acacia gums using questionnaires to evaluate reflux symptoms, quality of life and global refluxogenic scores was undertaken. It was found acacia gums can be taken after the evening meal in the same way as antacids to manage reflux symptoms but with more sustained overnight relief.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A significant number of people globally suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Over the counter antacids are used to relieve reflux symptoms associated with pain. If antacids are insufficient then proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the next choice for the treatment of reflux, GERD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and LPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PPIs are generally not intended for long-term use because of the potential for significant side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Acacia gums may provide long-term treatment options.\n\n【4】The exudative gum from _Acacia pycnantha_ (AP)) and _Acacia mearnsii_ endemic to southern regions of Australia, have been used as a food source and tonic by Australian Indigenous people for thousands of years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. _Acacia pycnantha_ (AP) is also known as the golden wattle and is the floral emblem of Australia. Exudative gum from acacia trees _Acacia senegal_ or _Acacia seyal_ that grow in northern African regions are classified as gum arabic (GA) or simply acacia gum. GA is an approved food additive, has a European food safety code E414 and does not require a numerical acceptable daily intake limit (ADI; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>). The chemical and physiochemical characteristics of 18 different acacia gum exudates have been characterized with AP and GA having the same chemical composition but different molecular weights and percentages of uronic acid and polysaccharides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The Cochrane Library database revealed 25 trials using typically 10–50 g GA per day over a period of 4–12 weeks and with between 10 and 100 participants but not in relation to reflux, GERD or LPR. Clinical trials report both gastrointestinal side effects and benefits from using GA and that no patients stopped GA because of these symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, no side effects were found to be reported for AP.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|_Acacia pycnantha_ in flower and gum exudates from the trunk.</u>\n\n【6】To evaluate the therapeutic effects of an antacid, PPIs and acacia gums as reflux treatments, three questionnaires have been used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The reflux symptom score (RSS) that provides an overall score for disorder frequency and severity of a complaint recalled over the previous month with zero being asymptomatic and with a maximum score of 625 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The quality of life impact (QOL) of a complaint, with zero having no impact to five having significant impact on life as recalled over the previous month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The global refluxogenic score (GRES) which puts common foods and drinks into categories 1–5 to assess the refluxogenic potential of the diet over the previous 3 weeks with highest scores given to reflux inducing foods like coffee, wine, chocolate and curry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 60-year-old male patient with no underlying health conditions and not using any medications has a 10-year history of reflux managed by the almost daily use of an antacid, calcium carbonate (CC) as 300 mg. Evening meals with spicy foods, wine and coffee, all dietary triggers causing reflux in this individual, were avoided.\n\n【9】After noticing phonic speech changes, some hoarseness and some pain on swallowing, direct fiber-optic laryngoscopic examination revealed LPR. The PPI, esomeprazole was taken nightly for 8 weeks as acid suppression therapy. At the end of 8 weeks, two tablets of an antacid composed of CC, sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate were taken daily. Short-term use of PPIs due to potential adverse effects and subsequently lifelong use of antacids are currently an optimal therapeutic regime for patients with LPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】At the end of 8 weeks a limited improvement in the symptoms of LPR was noted with mild odynophagia persisting. Discontinuation of the PPIs resulted in significantly increased reflux symptoms despite taking antacids and may have been the result of acid rebound hypersecretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Awareness of the tonic effects of acacia gum, which had been consumed during childhood, gum exudates collected directly from the AP tree was self-administered soon after the discontinuation of the PPIs. The AP was taken as 5–15 g after the evening meal when reflux symptoms began and on demand in the same way antacids are used. Symptom relief was felt in 5–10 min.\n\n【12】Due to the commercial availability of food grade GA powder, the same quantities of GA were trialled and found to bring relief to reflux symptoms in the same way as AP.\n\n【13】To determine if it was necessary to use AP or GA it was decided to stop their use and return to CC only. After one night the patient reported reflux symptoms that could not be managed by CC alone and returned to using GA with immediate symptom relief.\n\n【14】No significant gastrointestinal or other side effects were noted. The patient completed several RSS, QOL and GRES questionnaires at different times to show trends in the therapeutic response, Fig. 2 .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|The therapeutic response to reflux symptoms from the change in the RSS, QOL and GRES scores. The initial reflux treatment was CC alone ( **A** ) followed by PPIs treatment for 8 weeks on diagnosis of LPR ( **B** ), PPIs discontinuation causing increased reflux symptoms uncontrolled by CC alone ( **C** ), management of reflux with AP and regular CC ( **D** ), management of reflux with AP or GA and occasional use of CC ( **E** ), discontinuation of AP and GA and a return to CC (A1) and finally management of reflux with GA alone. The 95% confidence intervals shown.</u>\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The order of treatments are labelled A–E, A1, F and evaluated using the RSS, QOL and GRES questionnaires, Fig. 2 .\n\n【18】The three questionnaires were completed at least three times each and on different days for each of the treatments (A–E, F) except only once and without the GRES score when the AP or GA was discontinued and CC tried for the one night (A1) during week 16.\n\n【19】From Fig. 2 , the RSS and QOL scores indicate that the reflux symptoms experienced over the past 10 years (A) were reduced by the PPIs (B), AP (D, E) and GA (F) over 19 weeks. On discontinuation of the PPIs (C) or the AP and GA (A1) reflux symptoms returned and could not be managed by CC alone. This suggests that PPIs or either of AP or GA is essential in the management of the patients reflux symptoms and that symptom improvement is not simply a time related improvement of a chronic condition. Anecdotal evidence from the patient also supports the therapeutic benefits of AP and GA. The patient claims that a high GRES scoring diet in the evening causes significant acute reflux symptoms and while the antacid CC will bring immediate temporary relief, acacia gums are found to bring immediate sustained overnight relief and allow undisturbed sleep.\n\n【20】Statistically there are no significant differences between the GRES scores for all of the treatments (A–E, A1 and F). Anecdotal evidence from the patient was used to explain the trends in the GRES scores. The decrease in the GRES score on the discontinuation of the PPIs (C) was due to the increased symptoms of reflux preventing the patient from having coffee and wine. As reflux symptoms decreased (D, E and F), the patient could return to daily coffee and wine lifting the GRES score reflecting tolerance to a more refluxogenic diet (D, E and F).\n\n【21】The importance of the case report is that the acacia gums AP or GA may offer a long-term treatment option for some individuals suffering reflux, GERD or LPR and who find antacids insufficient or that symptoms return after a treatment with PPIs.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTERESTS STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The article adheres to ethical guidelines and local and legal requirements.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been obtained from the patient who has read the manuscript and approved it for publication.

In conclusion, radiologists, as well as gynecologists, and also pathologists may consider MDA among the differential diagnosis in patients with a vaginal discharge and multicysts in the cervix even after hysterectomy despite normal cytology and biopsy.\n\n【2】minimal deviation adenocarcinoma , adenoma malignum , cervical cancer , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of the cervix, otherwise known as adenoma malignum, is a rare variety of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix with multiple lobulations of distorted glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The incidence rate varies between 1 and 3% of all cervical cancers, and its pathology is unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The major clinical characteristics are mucoid vaginal discharge or bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a MDA case which developed after subtotal hysterectomy and was diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and managed surgically.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman (Gravid 2, Para 2) was referred from a private clinic to an academic hospital with a chief complaint of mucoid vaginal discharge for 4 years. She had a history of supracervical hysterectomy 10 years ago due to abnormal vaginal bleeding and uterine myoma. The pathology report showed a large uterus with multiple myoma. In physical examination, cervix appearance was slightly larger than normal and the evidence of chronic cervicitis was observed. The Thin Prep Pap smear was negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies. Colposcopy showed chronic inflammation and benign nabothian cysts without any malignant cells. She underwent a vaginal and abdominal ultrasound of cervix that revealed just nabothian cysts.\n\n【8】She performed MRI that showed a large cervix (63 × 50 × 44 mm) and multiple cervical cysts with the different sizes that suggested Tunnel Cluster . She was on stage Ib with no evidence of adnexal lesion. At this moment, adenoma malignum was considered as a main differential diagnosis that suggested by consultant radiologist.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|MRI appearance of pelvic before surgery with contrast.

Lymph node biopsy was normal. In pathology, the cervix was barrel shaped measuring 3 cm in length and 4 × 4 cm in diameters. The maximal depth of stromal invasion was 14 mm. Microscopic examination reveals atypical architecture including irregularly shaped, dilated and crowded glands with claw or crab-like profiles, intraluminal tufting , with pale round nuclei with minimal atypia and rare mitoses that invaded deep one-third of cervix (14 mm), near to the pericervical adipose tissue  suggesting adenoma malignum.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Well-differentiated irregularly shaped, dilated and crowded glands with desmoplastic response (hematoxylin and eosin \\[H&E\\] stain) ( **A** ).

In follow-up after 1 year by MRI and physical examination, she did not have any complication or relapse of the disease.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】MDA is a subcategory of mucinous adenocarcinoma of cervix. The mean age at diagnosis is 45 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Despite its benign appearance in histology, MDA could have an unfavorable prognosis (not necessary poor) due to lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, so timely and correct diagnosis is essential. Our case was in stage I and survived after 12 months follow-up without relapse.\n\n【15】Guo _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> reported two cases with MDA with watery discharge and enlarged cervix. One case had a history of myomectomy and ovarian cystectomy 10 years before. It may due to the cooperation of adenoma malignum with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome or ovarian tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, the pathology of the ovaries was nonspecific and no other abnormalities were detected in upper abdomen.\n\n【16】MDA unlike cervical squamous cell carcinoma is usually located deep within the endocervix. The detection rate of Pap smear, punch biopsy and conization were 7.6, 62.5 and 40% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our study, the Pap test was negative and the cervical biopsy was normal either, because the mass was very close to the internal os and not easy to access, we preferred a non-invasive diagnostic method with MRI.\n\n【17】A differential diagnosis of adenoma maligna on MRI is pseudoneoplastic glandular lesions and may mimic benign deep endocervical glands. Although normal glands are much fewer in number and have regular spaces, normal architecture and lack of cytological atypia and do not extend beyond 8 mm, but the depth of invasion in our case was 14 mm.\n\n【18】MRI evaluation of our case showed a large cervix and multiple cervical cysts with different sizes that suggested Tunnel Cluster. Multiple cystic lesions are classified based on the volume of solid component, the atypia and cellular activity, and the degree of invasion of the cervical stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasias (with or without atypia) are the differential diagnosis, but they have mucoid discharge and packed glands that are uniform without complex morphology and sensible cytological atypia. Indeed, they usually demonstrate no cervical enlargement and no solid component with no stromal invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Also, endocervical type adenomyoma is a rare benign tumor similar to MDA and despite a lobular arrangement; it has irregular outlines and papillary infoldings. Other differential diagnosis include HPV-related adenocarcinoma (particularly of mucinous type), endometrial adenocarcinoma and though rare metastatic adenocarcinoma with gastric or pancreatic origin.\n\n【20】HIK-1083 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, CEA, Ki67 and p53 staining may be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> and P16 as a marker for HPV is typically negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Considering the differential diagnosis and confirming the diagnosis by pathology and radiology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) reveals overlapping profile with limited value. According to the available evidences, we did not request IHC.\n\n【21】Surgery is the optimal option to manage MDA and including a radical hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy at the early stages and for advanced stages chemoradiotherapy is performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In the cases of hysterectomy with benign indications like ours, subsequent staging operations to define the exact tumor status may be necessary and adjuvant therapy based on surgical outcomes would be indicated. Our patient underwent removal of residual of uterine and cervix with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Lymph node biopsy was negative and no adjuvant therapy was needed.\n\n【22】The prognosis of MDA is known to be relatively poor especially in advanced stages, and it is more aggressive than HPV-associated cervical adenocarcinoma with tendency to lymph node metastasis and early peritoneal and abdominal spread. The 5-year survival is estimated to be 42% compared with 91% for endocervical adenocarcinoma. Otherwise in 1-year follow-up, no sign of further relapse was seen in this case.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】In conclusion, timely and prompt diagnosis is very critical in MDA. Therefore, radiologists as well as gynecologists and also the pathologists shall consider MDA among the differential diagnoses in the patients with a vaginal discharge and multicysts in cervix. Future research and longer follow-up are recommended to understand the nature of MDA to provide optimal management.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>E.S.: Project development, manuscript writing.

EDS is classified into 13 subtypes according to the most recent classification. These subtypes are clinically and genetically heterogenous. The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (spEDS) is caused by homozygous mutations in B4GALT7, B3GALT6 and SLC39A13. To date, 13 individuals with molecularly diagnosed SLC39A13-related spEDS have been reported. The spEDS caused by biallelic pathogenic SLC39A13 variants are characterized by short stature, protuberant eyes with bluish sclera, finely wrinkled palms, hypermobile joints, hyperextensible skin and characteristic radiological findings. Herein, we report a case of 7-year-old-female child with spEDS associated with novel homozygous (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) missense variation of the SLC39A13 gene.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is classified into 13 subtypes according to the 2017 international classification. The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (spEDS) is caused homozygous mutations in _B4GALT7_ , _B3GALT6_ and _SLC39A13._ We report a case of 7-year-old-female child with spEDS associated with novel gene missense mutation in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene. She presented with the classical features of spEDS.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】We report a case of 7-year-old-female child diagnosed with spEDS. She was second birth by order, born of third degree consanguineous marriage at full-term gestation by lower segment caesarean section in view of breech presentation. The antenatal course was uneventful. Her birth weight and length were normal. Megalocornea with a horizontal corneal diameter of 13 mm and vertical corneal diameter of 12.5 mm (normal horizontal corneal diameter range is 11.5–12 mm and vertical corneal diameter range is 10.5–11 mm; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>) and blue sclerae  were noticed at birth, however the neonatal period was uneventful. She was constantly under surveillance for vision affection, but had no visual impairment on follow-up. On routine developmental surveillance and screening at 9 months of age, child was found to have hypotonia, with gross motor delay (DQ—55), with normal deep tendon reflexes and no postural abnormality. Neurological examination did not reveal any abnormal findings apart from hypotonia. Other domains of development were satisfactory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain done for evaluation of hypotonia and motor delayat 10 months revealed abnormal T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense signals noted involving the bilateral peritrigonal and frontal white matter and bilateral centrum semi-ovale, showing no diffusion restriction or foci of blooming, features suggestive of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Occupational therapy and physiotherapy were instituted for hypotonia. Child was followed up and on regular development surveillance, gradual improvement in motor milestones was noted. After an interval of 3 years of lost to follow up, she presented at 7 years with complaints of gait abnormality, hypermobile joints and short stature. The motor delay noted in infancy was not evident now and she had normal development on assessment scales. On physical examination, child had proportionate short stature with height of 105 cm (−2 standard deviation \\[SD\\] to −3 SD) , with a mid-parental height of 156.5 cm (between 0 and −2SD) and weight of 15.02 kg (−2 SD to −3 SD; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>). She was found to mild hypotonia leading to waddling gait. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. The physical examination at the time was also significant for hypermobile joints  (Beighton score—8), hyperextensible skin (skin could be stretched to 2.8 cm on volar surface of forearm and to 1.5 cm on volar surface of palm), finely wrinkled palms  and pes planus. There was no evidence of scars or ecchymosis. Megalocornea, which was noticed at birth had similar dimensions at this age and was of non-progressive variant and did not cause any visual impairment. No other family member demonstrated similar phenotype. When evaluated for short stature, the systemic screening and thyroid function tests were done, which was normal. Her bone age was of 6 years and height age was of 4 years age at age of 7 years. She was evaluated for short stature-systemic screening including complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, liver and renal function tests, urine analysis, stool analysis and celiac screening were done, which were normal. Karyotype was 46XX. The findings of neuroimaging done at 7 years of age were similar to MRI done at 10 months of age with no progression of white matter changes .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Short stature, height 105 cm (< −2 SD) at 7 years age.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Protuberant eyes with megalocornea and bluish sclera.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|Finely wrinkled palms.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Hyperextensible joint.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 5|删除段之间换行|Cervical spine with platyspondyly.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 6|删除段之间换行|X-ray pelvis with small ilia.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 7|删除段之间换行|MRI imaging of the child showing metachromatic leukodystrophy.</u>\n\n【13】In view of consortium of findings of short stature, skin and eye involvement, and neurological involvement, next generation sequencing by whole exome sequencing analysis was done. A homozygous missense variation c.682G > A in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene (chr11:g.47413633G > A) that results in the amino acid substitution of Asparagine for Aspartic acid at codon 228(p.Asp228Asn) was found. The in silico predictions of this variant were predicted to be damaging by sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT), likelihood ratio rest (LRT) and Mutation Taster 2. Based on literature review p.Asp228Asn variant of _SLC39A13_ gene has not been reported in any research publication or case study or disease databases (ClinVar/Human Gene Mutation Database/Leiden Open Variation Database). Another homozygous variant of uncertain significance was found in CEP57 gene in exon 2(c.154C > T), which is known to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 2, not correlating with our phenotype.\n\n【14】EDS spondylodysplastic type 3 (OMIM#612350) is caused by homozygous mutations in the _SLC39A13_ gene (OMIM\\*608735). After establishing the genetic basis of our diagnosis, detailed skeletal survey was done, which was suggestive of small ilia, short and wide femoral neck and platyspondyly. 2D ECHO study was normal.\n\n【15】Our patient fulfils two major criteria (short stature and muscle hypotonia), three minor criteria (skin changes, pes planus and delayed motor development) for the diagnosis of spEDS and all minor criteria for SLC39A13 gene i.e. protuberant eyes with bluish sclerae, hands with finely wrinkled palms, atrophy of the thenar muscles, and tapering fingers, hypermobility of distal joints and characteristic radiologic findings . Hereby we report a novel gene missense mutation in exon 6 of the _SLC39A13_ gene leading to EDS, spondylodysplastic type 3 (EDSSPD3). She is being regularly screened and evaluated for development milestones, vision and growth.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The EDS are a group of connective tissue disorders that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with all subtypes have hallmark features of joint hypermobility, skin hyper extensibility and fragile connective tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a case with genetically confirmed spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) associated with novel homozygous missense variation of the _SLC39A13_ gene.\n\n【18】The EDS have been classified and re-classified in the light of additions of other subtypes on discovery of mutations in genes. Lately, the International consortium devised new classification in 2017, classifying EDS into 13 subtypes accounting for the fact that mutations have been identified in collagen genes as well as genes encoding collagen modifiers via new advent in molecular diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The spondylodysplastic subvariety of EDS (previously called as progeroid type), first described in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> requires fulfilment of major criteria, radiological abnormalities and general or gene-specific minor criteria for diagnosis. The spEDS subtype is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and homozygous pathogenic mutations in _B4GALT7, B3GALT6_ and _SLC39A13_ have been identified as etiological genes. Although the former two genes regulate production of glycosoaminoglycans, _SLC39A13_ regulates the intra-cytosolic influx of Zinc. Mutation in this gene thus leads to low cytosolic zinc concentrations, causing alteration of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein signalling. Though the pathogenesis of SLC39A13 mutation is not fully understood, it has been proposed that altered levels of intracellular growth factors leads to altered functioning of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissue, which is responsible for the characteristic phenotype. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To date, 13 individuals with molecularly diagnosed _SLC39A13_ \\-related spEDS have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7–9 \\]</u> and this is the first report from India to the best of our knowledge.\n\n【20】EDS group of disorders is not associated with short stature. However, unlike other subtypes of EDS, spEDS demonstrates a progressive growth retardation and compromised height potential, which is also a major criterion of diagnosis. Although _B3GALT6 and B4GALT7_ mutations are associated with skeletal abnormalities and are classified as ‘skeletal dysplasia’, _SLC39A13_ causes growth failure which is not associated with skeletal abnormalities and has proportionate body segment ratios. Growth faltering and compromised adult height has been consistently reported feature of _SLC39A13_ deficiency, though the pathogenesis of this statural phenotype is poorly understood.\n\n【21】The other major clinical criterion—hypotonia, not associated with myopathy has been consistently described associated with _SLC39A13_ in early years of life leading to delayed motor development. The subtle manifestations of this hypotonia are thenar/hypothenar atrophy, weakness of hands and waddling gait. However, recently a case describes associated myopathy features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The hypotonia can be so profound to be diagnosed as myopathy initially. Other consistent ocular connective tissue manifestations are thin sclerae, imparting a blue hue and cornea deformities (megalocornea, myopia and keratoconus), mandating ophthalmological surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Dental features like dysplastic teeth and decreased number of permanent teeth are reported, however our patient is in the phase of mixed dentition currently. Vascular fragility is not a consistent feature of spEDS unlike other subtypes, and minor venous varicosities are reported. However, a report describes catastrophic intracerebral bleeding. The peculiar phenotype includes flat facial profile, hypertelorism, downward palpebral fissures, prominent eyes and small mouth. To conclude, spEDS being a connective tissue disorder, it mandates a multidisciplinary approach involving various subspecialists. Regular surveillance of vision and growth is required.\n\n【22】The diagnostic criteria are laid down for diagnosis of spEDS with the subcategories being major, minor and gene-specific. Short stature is a feature which differentiated sp-EDS from all other varieties of EDS. SpEDS is an autosomal recessive disorder which can be diagnosed by next generation sequencing techniques. The establishment of genetic basis helps to counsel the family regarding the further course of life and progeny, undermining its importance. Our findings of association of leukodystrophy with _SLC39A13_ related spEDS expands our knowledge of the associations of this subvariety as well as spectrum of clinical presentation.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】*   What is known is the characteristic clinical and etiological profile of SLC39A3 related EDS. The features in our patient comply with previously reported patients, namely hypotonia, short stature, characteristic facies with connective tissue weakness and ocular manifestations.\n\n【25】*   What is new is discovery of association of white matter changes in form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, though non-progressive, but needs follow-up as a final outcome.\n\n【26】### ABBREVIATIONS\n\n【27】ABBREVIATIONS\n\n【28】*   DQ\n\n【29】    Development quotient;\n\n【30】    EDS\n\n【31】    Ehlers Danlos syndromes;\n\n【32】    EDSSPD3\n\n【33】    Ehlers Danlos syndrome, spondylodysplastic type 3;\n\n【34】    FLAIR\n\n【35】    Fluid attenuated inversion recovery;\n\n【36】    spEDS\n\n【37】    Spondylodysplastic EDS;\n\n【38】    SD\n\n【39】    Standard deviation;\n\n【40】    TGFβ\n\n【41】    Transforming growth factor beta.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank TNMC and BYL Nair Hospital for its constant support.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval required.</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent of parents taken on appropriate form provided by the institute.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Harpreet Kaur, MD, Senior resident, Department of Paediatrics, TNMC and BYL Nair Hospital.</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:47:29", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:48:02", "cost": 32.902}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:48:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:47:29"}

Protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha ( _PRKAR1A_ ) is known to be the responsible gene. Breast myxomatosis and ductal adenoma, which are regarded as benign, are well-known mammary lesions of CNC and are included in the main diagnostic criteria. In this case, a 59-year-old woman with repeated cardiac myxoma was diagnosed with CNC with _PRKAR1A_ mutation. She also had three multiple breast tumours bilaterally: breast cancer, adenomyoepithelioma and intraductal papilloma. In mammary lesions of CNC, attention should be paid to benign lesions, such as breast myxomatosis or ductal adenomas, and the development of breast cancer or breast tumours with malignant potential. Mammary lesions should be aggressively scrutinized and considered for resection, as required.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Carney complex (CNC) is a multiple tumour syndrome characterized by cutaneous pigmented lesions, myxoma mainly on the skin/heart/breast and endocrine or neural tumours, among others. CNC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by inactivating mutations of the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha ( _PRKAR1A_ ) gene. In families affected by CNC, 62% had a detectable _PRKAR1A_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. _De novo_ mutations in _PRKAR1A_ have been detected in about one-third of CNC cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. For mammary gland lesions, breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenomas are included in the CNC’s main diagnostic criteria; however, the involvement of breast cancer and other breast tumours is currently not clearly known. Herein, we encountered a CNC case with multiple breast tumours that were not myxomatosis or breast ductal adenoma but breast cancer, adenomyoepithelioma (AME) and intraductal papilloma (IDP).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 59-year-old woman presented with a mass in the breast. Family history revealed that her father had skin cancer in his 60s, and her paternal aunt had osteosarcoma in her 40s. Her medical history was as follows : in 2005, she underwent a right breast tumourectomy and was diagnosed with IDP. In 2011, left breast cancer was detected, and preoperative screening echocardiography coincidentally revealed left atrial myxoma; cardiac surgery was performed to remove the myxoma. In 2012, left breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed; infiltrating elements of histological grade 1, measuring 13 mm, were observed in the lesion. On immunohistochemical examination, neoplastic cells were positive for oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (total Allred scores: 8 and 8, respectively). The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 score was 1+ in invasive neoplastic cells. The final diagnosis was stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma (pT1cN0M0), luminal subtype. Tamoxifen was administered as adjuvant hormone therapy based on pathological findings. Additionally, the patient underwent whole left breast radiotherapy (42.56 Gy). In 2016, she was diagnosed with right atrial myxoma and underwent cardiac surgery again. CNC was suspected because of repeated cardiac myxoma, and she was confirmed to meet the CNC diagnostic criteria. Moreover, genetic testing revealed a _PRKAR1A_ pathogenic variant. Conversely, genetic testing to identify germline mutations in other genes, such as _BRCA1/2_ , was not performed. Additionally, somatic gene mutations in breast cancer were not investigated. In 2020, she developed a new right breast mass . Physical examination revealed ocular conjunctiva, and pigmentation was observed in the right eye; brown spotty skin pigmentation was observed on the lips, surrounding area and anterior chest . The right breast mass was described as a complicated cyst on mammography and ultrasonography ; needle biopsy confirmed atypical ductal hyperplasia. Therefore, a right breast tumourectomy was performed . Based on histopathological findings , the final diagnosis was AME of the breast. Since the tumour was resected, the post-operative policy was regular follow-up without additional treatment. Currently, no apparent recurrence or metastasis of any breast tumour has been observed.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Important timelines.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Physical findings in 2020.

First, CNC could be relevant to the bilateral development of multiple breast tumours, other than breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenoma. Second, in mammary lesions of CNC, attention should be paid to the occurrence of breast cancer or breast tumours with malignant potential.\n\n【13】The most common CNC-associated mammary tumour is breast myxomatosis, which occurs in ~20% of female patients after puberty and is often bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Second, ductal adenoma also often occurs, with a frequency of ~3% in female patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Both are considered benign lesions; reports of malignant transformation in patients are unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in a report investigating 338 patients with CNC, only one patient (0.3%) had breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a CNC case with breast cancer, AME and IDP.\n\n【14】Breast lesions commonly found in patients with CNCs are generally benign and unlikely to significantly impact prognosis. However, _PRKAR1A_ is associated with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> because the protein kinase A signal is activated by _PRKAR1A_ loss and promotes mammary tissue carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, attention should be paid to breast cancer complications, especially in patients with CNC with _PRKAR1A_ mutation, as in this case. Conversely, AME is a rare tumour characterized by biphasic proliferation of ductal epithelium and myoepithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. AME is associated with a spectrum of diseases, ranging from benign to malignant tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>; hence, surgical resection is often considered. Appropriate tissue biopsy is important to ensure that these lesions are not overlooked.\n\n【15】This is an unusual case of three different breast tumours—breast cancer, AME and IDP. The history of these breast tumours alone does not suggest possible CNC. However, if attention has been paid to the distinctive pigmentation of the anterior chest and cardiac myxoma, even a breast surgeon may have been able to consider any genetic disease. The possibility of a genetic disorder should be considered, even if it is unlikely to be positive.\n\n【16】Regarding breast surveillance in diagnosed CNC cases, more intensive follow-up with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with mammography and ultrasonography may be recommended for preservation and early detection of similar cases, following the hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. Moreover, a family history of carcinoma, particularly of the thyroid, colon, pancreas and ovaries and other multiple benign or malignant tumours, is a finding suggestive or possibly associated with CNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; therefore, for surveillance of organs for carcinogenesis, other than the breast, we should particularly focus on these organs.\n\n【17】In conclusion, multiple breast tumours can develop bilaterally in CNC, including breast cancer, even if breast myxomatosis and breast ductal adenoma do not exist. Biopsy of breast lesions may be postponed or breast lesions may be left untreated even if they are pathologically diagnosed; however, a malignant breast tumour can coexist, as in this case. Therefore, actively scrutinizing breast lesions is important. Further studies investigating the relationship between CNC and breast tumours, including breast cancer, are warranted.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors’ conflicts of interest are not related to this work.

A 69-year-old woman presented with an ischemic electrocardiogram changes during a medical check-up. Coronary computed tomography angiography showed right coronary artery (RCA) ectasia associated with a giant aneurysm originating from the distal RCA. She was asymptomatic and exhibited no risk factors, including Kawasaki disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or family history. The patient underwent surgery for giant coronary aneurysms to prevent rupture. The aneurysm was on the peripheral side of the right coronary artery; hence, coronary artery bypass was not performed. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm revealed degeneration due to atherosclerosis. She was prescribed warfarin and aspirin for thrombus prevention.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) and coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) are aneurysmal dilatations of the coronary artery.

CAE is defined as diffuse dilatation of coronary arteries more than one-third of their length, and CAA is defined as dilatation of less than one-third of the length of the coronary artery. Although considered an infrequent finding during coronary angiography, the prevalence of CAE is reported to be between 0.3% and 5.3%; likewise, the prevalence of CAA is reported to be between 1.5% and 4.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Although the most common aetiology for the development of CAE and CAA has been found to be atherosclerosis, there have been few reports of CAE cases associated with CAA.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate ischaemia and was found to have a coronary aneurysm, and chest radiography showed a protruding coronary aneurysm . Coronary computed tomography angiography showed right coronary artery (RCA) ectasia associated with a giant aneurysm originating from the distal RCA . The diameters of the ectasia and aneurysm were 15 and 70 mm, respectively. Coronary angiography showed no stenosis or dilatation in the left coronary artery , whereas the right CAE was observed along its entire length . A giant CAA was also observed . She was asymptomatic and exhibited no risk factors, including Kawasaki disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or family history. CAA was so large that an aneurysmectomy was performed to prevent rupture. The aneurysm and CAE  were exposed to cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass performed through a median sternotomy. The aneurysmal wall was incised, and the inflow hole was confirmed with antegrade cardioplegia. There was neither an outflow nor fistula in the aneurysm. The inflow hole was closed with a pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene mattress suture inside the aneurysm without closing the coronary artery distal to the RCA . The aneurysmal sac was then punctured. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm revealed degeneration due to atherosclerosis . A coronary CT scan showed no inflow into the CAA postoperatively . The patient was prescribed warfarin and aspirin for the prevention of thrombus in the dilated coronary arteries in the CAE to prevent myocardial infarction. The patient is still recovering without any postoperative complications and is doing well as an outpatient.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|The electrocardiogram at the time of admission shows negative T waves in 2, 3 and aVf inductions.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Chest radiography shows aneurysm as protruding mass.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|(A) The CAE is seen (①).

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to save patients. However, until now, there has been no consensus on the optimal strategy for the treatment of CAE and CAA due to a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials or official guidelines. The optimal strategy should be individualized, based on the size and morphology of the aneurysms and associated lesions, for each patient. In this case, since this patient did not have any symptoms, coronary ectasia and a huge aneurysm were incidentally found with electrocardiogram during a medical check-up. Because the size of the aneurysm was enormous and the risk of rupture was high, we performed surgical resection of the aneurysm. As the aneurysm was located in the peripheral RCA, we did not perform coronary artery bypass grafting. Atherosclerosis is considered the common etiologic factor responsible for CAE in adults, whereas Kawasaki disease is the most common cause in children and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient did not have a history of Kawasaki disease, and the histopathological results of the ectasia and aneurysms showed degeneration due to atherosclerosis. However, there were no risk factors for atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic lesions in other coronary arteries. There have also been reports of coronary aneurysms that developed after the primary coronary artery dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although CAA usually develops with sudden chest pain, such as acute coronary syndrome, and has a high fatality rate, it is possible that in our patient, this disease occurred asymptomatically, and the tunica media subsequently became vulnerable and formed a coronary aneurysm.\n\n【17】CAE is still present in this case. The presence of CAE predicts future cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Doi _et al._ suggested that acute myocardial infarction patients with CAE are a high-risk subset who might benefit from a pharmacological approach to control the coagulation cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Concomitant use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications should be used with caution because they increase the risk of bleeding events, but they may be effective in preventing myocardial infarction.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The studies have received an approval from our institutional ethics review board.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All study participants provided informed consent.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Takanori Hishikawa.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The comments provided by Associate Editor and two anonymous reviewers greatly improved the clarity of the manuscript.

Androgen secreting tumors can arise from either the ovarian sex cord/stromal cells or from the adrenal glands. Cystadenomas are relatively benign ovarian epithelial tumors that have rarely been implicated as the cause of hyperandrogenism. Histologically these tumors are classified as mucinous or serous. We present here a case of a 60-year-old postmenopausal female with symptoms of hyperandrogenism including hirsutism and virilization for one year. Labs were significant for high total testosterone levels persistently. On imaging, our patient was found to have a left adnexal cyst, which was subsequently removed and found to be of serous histology. Upon removal of the cyst, patients’ total testosterone levels normalized. Our case highlights the importance of including cystadenomas in the differentials when evaluating for tumorous causes of hyperandrogenism.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is difficult to diagnose due to the normal hormonal changes associated with aging. Rapid onset and progression of hyperandrogenism symptoms should raise concern for a possible tumorous source. Androgen secreting tumors can arise from either the adrenal glands or ovaries. Clinical manifestations include hirsutism, acne, anabolic appearance, androgenic alopecia, deepening of the voice and virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The predominant androgens found in women are testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). High testosterone levels but normal DHEA and DHEAS levels indicate an ovarian origin for the increased androgens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most androgen secreting tumors of the ovaries arise from sex cord cells (thecal/granulosa) that surround the oocyte or from stromal cells. Androgen secreting adrenal tumors are commonly carcinomas, that secrete cortisol, resulting in women presenting with Cushingoid symptoms as well. Cystadenomas, tumors arising from the ovarian epithelium, account for 60% of ovarian tumors. They are usually benign adnexal masses further classified into serous or mucinous types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Cystadenomas can secrete beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), which can possibly stimulate androgen secretion resulting in virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Very few reports have been published over time citing these benign adenomas as the cause of virilization in postmenopausal women. We present a rare case of a testosterone producing serous cystadenoma in a postmenopausal female.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old postmenopausal female, with only a past medical history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years ago due to uterine fibroids, presented to the gynecology clinic for clitoral enlargement, hirsutism, deepening of voice, decreased sexual drive and increasing abdominal circumference for 1 year. Chemistry showed Creatinine 0.90, Blood urea Nitrogen (BUN) 15, Glomerular filtration rate 70. Hepatic function panel revealed alkaline phosphatase 99, Alanine Transaminase (ALT) 19, Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 21. All unchanged from baseline labs 1 year ago. Lipid panel revealed normal cholesterol levels but an elevated LDL of 108. TSH was within normal limits. Pelvic ultrasound revealed an anechoic, nonvascular, cystic lesion measuring 10.5 × 5.9 × 6.2 cm in the left adnexa .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Sagittal view of left adnexal cyst measuring 10.5 cm × 5.9 cm × 6.2 cm on TVUS.</u>\n\n【7】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was subsequently ordered and confirmed the ultrasound findings of a cystic left adnexal mass and of importance, no adrenal mass was noted . No abnormality was noted in the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach, liver, spleen and colon were unremarkable with no evidence of obstruction or abnormal growth.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Sagittal view of left adnexal cyst (yellow arrow) on CT abdomen and pelvis.</u>\n\n【9】Initial workup for hyperandrogenism revealed a normal free testosterone level of 4.2 pg/ml but an elevated total testosterone 264.3 ng/dl level. Further workup showed DHEA-S 29.2 ug/dl, CA-125 5 U/ml, Inhibin-A 1 pg/ml; all within the normal limits. The patient was scheduled for a repeat transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in 3 months for monitoring of the left adnexal cyst. Repeat TVUS showed no change in adnexal cyst size or characteristics but persistence of the hyperandrogenism symptoms. The patient was then referred to endocrinology clinic for further evaluation. Patient endorsed similar symptoms as before in the endocrinology clinic. Baseline labs were repeated again. Chemistry revealed unchanged with normal Creatinine, BUN, Glomerular Filtration Rate-indicating kidney function (GFR) and electrolytes. CBC also remained unremarkable, with no changed in baseline hemoglobin, hematocrit or white blood cells. Hemoglobin a1c was obtained, found to be 5.8. Hepatic functional panel also remained unchanged from before, with no elevation in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase or ALT/AST. HIV and Hepatitis B workup was negative for the patient. Repeat lipid panel showed elevation in LDL 通用删除7(英):<u>(116)</u> and triglycerides 通用删除7(英):<u>(178)</u>. The initial workup for hyperandrogenism was repeated. Repeat labs showed a slight elevation of free testosterone 4.7 pg/ml with continued elevated total testosterone of 276 ng/dl. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) (41.7 IU/L) and Leutinizing Hormone (LH) (26.6 IU/L) levels were within the normal limits for postmenopausal women. Fasting 8 am cortisol level was suppressed (1.0 ug/dl). DHEA, Estradiol and DHEA-S were within normal limits again. The patient had another TVUS that showed a slight increase in the adnexal mass, now measuring 11.7 × 5.5 × 8.3 cm. After a multidisciplinary meeting, including endocrinology, gynecology and gynecology-oncology, the patient was scheduled for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgical pathology report showed a serous cystadenoma of the left ovary. Repeat total testosterone levels, post-operative, returned to normal levels with gradual resolution of symptoms.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is usually attributed to tumorous causes. Androgen secretion normally declines gradually with aging, with levels rarely higher than premenopausal women. These levels can usually cause mild hyperandrogenism symptoms, including decrease in scalp hair and presence of facial hair. Development of severe hirsutism along with symptoms of virilization (clitoromegaly, deepening of voice and male pattern baldness) usually indicate a tumorous origin of such symptoms. These tumors can arise from the adrenal gland or the ovaries. Elevation of the specific type of androgen, whether testosterone, DHEA or DHEAS helps to delineate the source. Androgen secreting adrenal tumors usually secrete cortisol and androgens simultaneously. These tumors are rare and usually carcinomatous in origin. Testosterone production from an adrenal origin is extremely rare. Zhou _et al_ . published a case report of a purely testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor with no concomitant rise in DHEA or DHEAS. Such tumors are hypothesized to arise from translocation of gonadal cells or differentiation of adrenal cells into Leydig cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ovarian epithelial tumors are predominantly benign tumors, with very few cases citing cystadenomas as the cause of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Most cases of hyperandrogenism are reported in pregnant or women of reproductive age. Goudas _et al._ published a case in 1996 of an ovarian cyst as the cause of high testosterone levels in a postpartum female 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nizam _et al._ published a case report in 2021 attributing a mucinous cystadenoma as the source of postmenopausal virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our report, postmenopausal virilization due to elevated testosterone is attributed to a cystadenoma of serous histology. Transformation of nonfunctional cystadenomas into androgen secreting tumors is not clear. High LH levels causing excessive stromal stimulation is a possible cause of such transformation, though in our case, LH levels were within normal limits. Another proposed mechanism is the stimulation of ovarian stromal cells by increased blood flow due to the large size of these tumors. Production of antibodies that mimic the effect of LH is another hypothesis. Secretion of hormones including beta-hCG is another possible mechanism that may cause these nonfunctional tumors to start producing testosterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Evaluation of a patient with signs and symptoms of excess androgen requires thorough history taking, physical examination and diagnostic workup. In our case, initial imaging showed a relatively benign appearing cystic lesion which was later found to be the source of the excess testosterone. Adrenal causes were ruled out by CT imaging and normal DHEA/DHEA-S levels. Serial monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are critical to efficient management of such cases. As shown in our case, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy proved to be beneficial and curative for our patient.\n\n【12】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【13】We presented a rare case of serous cystadenoma producing testosterone in an elderly female. Prior cases reported such clinical scenario in women of reproductive age, whereas this is a rare case reported in an elderly woman. Clinicians should keep it as a differential in elderly women presenting with rapid onset hirsutism and virilization.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Julia Vargas for her guidance.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written consent was obtained from patient to publish the case.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Amnah Khalid MD.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:24:12", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:28:26", "cost": 254.074}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:28:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:24:12"}

Venolymphatic malformations are very rare in children. Such presentation around the parotid region yet to be reported. This case report describes a rare presentation of a neonatal venolymphatic malformation on the parotid duct. A 4-week-old termly delivered male infant referred to by a general practitioner bruising over the left buccal area for 1 day from non-consanguine healthy parents. On examination a bluish discoloration in the buccal mucosa over a firm mildly tender area without signs of inflammation was seen.

Very rarely neonate and children can be present with suppurative parotitis due to staphylococcus infection where only 44 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Vascular malformation of the children can appear from the antenatal period up to childhood and 60% of them are confined to the head and neck region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There are several ways of classifying congenital vascular anomalies. The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) has described uniform classification. According to that classification congenital vascular anomaly is divided into two categories as vascular tumour and vascular malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】This is the first reported case of venolymphatic malformation of the parotid region in a neonate.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|External appearance of the cheek.

There was no history of trauma, coagulopathy, fever, irritability, poor feeding nor documentation of discolouration or patch during the first neonatal examination. The child was fed well, and the urine output and bowel frequency were normal.\n\n【9】This child was born as the second child to non-consanguine healthy parents with no family history of coagulopathies, after an uneventful antenatal period of 35 weeks by an emergency lower segment caesarean section due to foetal tachycardia. His birth weight was 2.62 kg. Then he was treated for suspected sepsis and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia at the special care baby unit and spent the first 2 days of life establishing feeding with nasogastric tube and formula top ups.\n\n【10】The clinical examination on admission showed bluish discoloration on the centre of the left buccal area measuring 3 cm horizontally and 2.5 cm in vertical plane . Firm mild tender underlying swelling without features of trauma, active bleeding or signs of inflammation together with bluish discoloration was identified in the buccal mucosa. The rest of the physical examination, system examination and anthropometric measurements were normal.\n\n【11】The laboratory investigations including full blood count, coagulation screen, inflammatory markers, renal profile, liver profile and bone profile were within normal limits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Due to the nature of the presentation the possibility of non-accidental injury (NAI) was considered and investigations including skeletal survey, computed tomography (CT) head, fundoscopy and strategy multidisciplinary meeting took place. The ultrasound examination of the lesion showed fluid and solid soft tissue suggestive of haematoma . CT scan of the head revealed that there is a 1–1.2-cm subcutaneous hyperdensity left buccal area with haematoma due to a possible pre-existing vascular malformation and no intracranial haemorrhages . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed the rupture of the parotid duct with venolymphatic malformation .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|Ultrasound scan images of the lesion the left cheek, showing fluid and solid soft tissue suggestive of haematoma.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3|删除段之间换行|CT scan image (sagittal plane—left, coronal plane—right), showing 1–1.2-cm subcutaneous hyperdensity left buccal area with haematoma due to a possible pre-existing vascular malformation and no intracranial haemorrhages.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|MRI showing the rupture of the parotid duct with venolymphatic malformation.</u>\n\n【15】The child has been referred to the vascular malformation clinic and plastic surgical clinic in a tertiary care hospital (Alder Hay Children Hospital, Liverpool, UK) for further follow-up.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Disorders of the salivary gland including parotid gland acute and chronic inflammation and infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> are exceedingly rare in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, and venolymphatic malformation around the parotic gland and presenting with bluish discolouration a few days after birth is rare. Most of the time vascular malformation is present as a birth mark.\n\n【18】Congenital vascular malformation arises because of structural malformations of vascular development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, which appears from in utero to childhood but most of the time lesions are diagnosed at birth. Vascular malformation causes surrounding soft tissue abnormality that leads to functional and aesthetic impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of the lesions and the treatments can be complicated, due to lack of signs and symptoms, lack of follow-up and limitation of specific diagnostic tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Majority of vascular malformation (~60%) in the children and neonate are confined to the head and neck region and it gives enormous psychological and physiological problems to both the child and the parents. All the congenital vascular anomalies are categorized into two main categories under vascular tumours and vascular malformation. Nomenclature of the vascular malformations depends on the predominant type of the vessel (lymphatic, arterial or venous) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Venolymphatic malformation comes under a combined category of vascular malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Vascular malformations are also categorized according to the haemodynamic characteristics under high–low and low flow. Venous, lymphatic and capillary malformations are categorized under low-flow malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Vascular malformation around the parotid gland is an extremely infrequent entity that needs a specific diagnostic and management approach. Up to now, a few cases have been reported and all of them were adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】When a nonmobile child, especially a neonate, present with bruises, NAI and coagulation disorders need be excluded. However, very rarely can neonate be presented with bruises due to the rupture of underlying vascular malformations. In this case, all the probable causes of bruises in neonate have been excluded, and the rupture of the parotid duct and venovascular malformation has been diagnosed by the MRI and repeated ultrasonography of the head and neck.\n\n【22】The plan of management for this child was watchful waiting for 3 months and then to be decided on further management depending on the nature of the residual lesion. According to Ana Paula Pinho Matos _et al._ 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, 15% (3/20) venolymphatic malformations has showed spontaneous resolution or stable and asymptomatic after 3–18-year follow-up study in Brazil. The spontaneous resolution rate for the cervico-facial macrocystic lymphatic malformations presenting at birth or later in life are 11.5% after 1-year follow-up study of 104 subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, which is comparable with 13% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> and 12.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The medical options available are sclerotherapy, minimally invasive surgical resection, laser therapy and radiofrequency ablation. Systemic pharmacological treatment with sirolimus (non-calcineurin-inhibiting immunosuppressant) is considered for patients with diffuse and infiltrative lymphatic malformations refractory to previous therapy and/or when surgical approach is not feasible due to the risk of permanent iatrogenic damage (e.g. blindness). According to the single case report of successful improvement of a complex periorbital venolymphatic malformation with sirolimus and prednisolone (Kim D. _et al._ in 2015) combined therapy that was initially failed to respond to the sildenafil treatment and sclerotherapy may have a place in management.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors would like to acknowledge the parents of the child described for allowing us to share his clinical details, and thank Dr Caroll, paediatric radiologist, at the Radiology Department of Furness General Hospital, for the advice and provision of radiology images and her team for providing proper images of the lesion and Cumbria Police for providing images of the lesion upon official request.

There are increasing reports associating chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin with prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias (monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) in COVID-19 patients.

The aminoquinoline drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have received worldwide attention as potential therapies. Optimism for repurposing these drugs stems from two lines of evidence: inhibition of coronaviridae (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) _in vitro_ and an open-label non-randomized study that involved treatment using hydroxychloroquine (combined in some patients with azithromycin, an azalide antibiotic with putative antiviral properties) that reported improved virologic clearance in the intervention group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Regimens employed vary but are generally equivalent to 400–1200 mg hydroxychloroquine (250–1000 mg chloroquine) per day for ~5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, both agents can cause rare and serious adverse effects (<10%), including corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, hypoglycemia, neuropsychiatric effects and retinopathy. The potential risk of arrhythmias must be monitored, especially in critically ill patients and in those taking concomitant QT interval prolonging medications such as azithromycin and fluoroquinolones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The safety profile of these drugs in the context of COVID-19 patients is still unknown, although there are increasing reports of adverse effects with this treatment. In this regard, we present the case of a patient with COVID-19 treated with chloroquine plus azithromycin who developed a sudden episode of wide complex tachycardia (WCT).\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Wide complex tachycardia presented in the patient.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|The rhythm following pharmacologic cardioversion.</u>\n\n【6】CASE\n----\n\n【7】A 43-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department due to intermittent fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea started a week ago. He had a 24-year history of hypertension and chronic renal disease due to non-specific glomerulonephritis, receiving a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor 6 months ago and surgical parathyroidectomy due to tertiary hyperparathyroidism. His medications were nifedipine 30 mg twice daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, mycophenolic acid 500 mg twice daily, tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily, prednisone 25 mg/day, calcium carbonate 4 g/day and calcitriol 0.25 mcg/day. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, shortness of breath and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation level of 83% (room air). Relevant laboratory findings were leucopenia (1980 mm <sup>3 </sup> , normal range \\[NR\\] 4000–10 000 mm <sup>3 </sup> ), lymphopenia (0.200 mm <sup>3 </sup> , NR 0.600–3400 mm3) and lactate dehydrogenase 981 U/L (NR 240–480 U/L); Serum electrolytes were normal: sodium 136 mmol/L (NR 136–145 mmol/L), potassium 4.1 mmol/L (NR 3.5–5.1 mmol/L), magnesium 1.8 mg/dl (NR 1.6–2.5 mg/dl), calcium 8.8 mg/dl (8.6–10.2 mg/dl), phosphorus 3.91 mg/dl (NR 2.7–4.5 mg/dl). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph showed bilateral ground glass image. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction with nasopharyngeal swab was positive.\n\n【8】The patient was classified as COVID-19 severe disease according to World Health Organization classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and was transferred to the department of Internal Medicine where he was evaluated to select the management as follows: the QTc of the baseline ECG was calculated manually using the Bazett formula, being 410 ms (NR 350–480 ms), and a validated risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients was performed, by which he was classified as ‘low risk’ (6 points) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, a standard regimen with chloroquine plus azithromycin was started (chloroquine 500 mg twice on day 1, then 500 mg daily on Days 2–5 plus azithromycin 500 mg daily on Day 1, then 250 mg daily on Days 2–5). An informed consent for the treatment was obtained according to the institutional standards. However, on Day 4 of therapy, the patient suddenly developed a fast-WCT at 180 beats/min, managed as ventricular tachycardia (VT) with amiodarone 300 mg IV. Unfortunately, it was not possible to record the complete 12 lead ECG, only a DII rhythm strip. A close inspection showed possible atrio-ventricular dissociation  that suggests the diagnosis of VT. The rhythm following cardioversion 5 min after starting amiodarone infusion was visualized with a DII rhythm strip, which showed an irregular rhythm, QRS 110 ms at 100 beats/min on average with biphasic T waves with ST-segment depression, without organized atrial activity, suggesting atrial fibrillation. There was no evidence of prolonged QT . A measurement of troponin I was obtained during the arrhythmia episode, which was 0.2 ng/dl (NR 0.0–0.6 ng/dl). Laboratory tests obtained on the same day (prior to the arrhythmia episode) were not relevant to explain the event (leucocytes 2050 mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophils 1790 mm <sup>3 </sup> , lymphocytes 0.110 mm <sup>3 </sup> , sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.26 mmol/L, magnesium 1.7 mg/dl, calcium 9.1 mg/dl, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dl). A Cardiology Service consultation was requested; unfortunately, the patient presented a cardiac arrest (50 min after pharmacological cardioversion) without response to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and died.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【10】The use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently supported primarily by _in vitro_ and weak studies involving humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are being used internationally off-label to treat patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While multiple studies are planned or underway, the current evidence about the benefit is very uncertain and on the other hand, information regarding possible harms is on the rise. In fact, both drugs are listed as definite causes of torsade de pointes at crediblemeds.org , thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes and drug induced-sudden cardiac death. In a retrospective study that included 251 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the treatment with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on Day 1, then 400 mg daily on Days 2–5) along with azithromycin (500 mg daily for 5 days) was associated with a prolonged QTc of ≥500 ms (a known marker of high-risk malignant arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death) in 23% of cases and with a torsade de pointes in one patient (estimated incidence at 0.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In perspective, this is 4 times the estimated incidence of single infusion of IV sotalol induced torsade de pointes (0.1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In the present case, although we were unable to get a 12 lead ECG, we considered that the WTC was very likely a monomorphic VT based on the analysis of the DII rhythm strip. We hypothesize that such condition was possibly related to the combined chloroquine/azithromycin therapy along with the previously described associated medical conditions. The appearance of VT (without torsade de pointes) has been described in two patients who received high doses of chloroquine (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although the dose of chloroquine was lower in the case presented, it is possible that the simultaneous use of azithromycin and tacrolimus (another medication with known capacity to increase QTc) had had a synergistic cardiotoxic effect. Another factor to consider is a possible myocarditis. Myocardial injury with elevated troponin levels occurs in 20–30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with higher rates (55%) among those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Myocarditis is a potential mechanism that could result in arrhythmogenesis among COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the present case, the patient did not present with elevated troponins suggesting myocarditis. However, in autopsy cases, myocardial viral activity in the absence of evidence of myocarditis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Therefore, we speculate that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiomyocyte could result in alteration of signaling pathways that, together with proarrhythmogenic drugs, generated the arrythmia in this patient.\n\n【12】In conclusion, due to the absence of clinical benefit on morbidity and mortality with the use of antimalarials or azithromycin or the combination of both drugs in patients with COVID-19, and given the increase in reports of adverse effects related to these drugs, their use should be avoided until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy is available.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent for publication has been obtained from the authorized representative of the patient, in line with the COPE best practice guidelines.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declared no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:49:47", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:50:04", "cost": 17.018}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:50:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:49:47"}

Clinical examination showed sloughy membranous conjunctivitis with normal visual acuity. He was reviewed by dermatology and diagnosed with EMM secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The symptoms resolved with oral and topical steroids, lubricants and chloramphenicol eye drops. Erythema multiforme has been reported in association with COVID-19, although the major form is rare. Ophthalmologists should consider current or previous COVID-19 infection in patients presenting with conjunctivitis or pseudomembrane formation. Prompt initiation of steroids aids resolution.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Our understanding of the presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has advanced significantly since its identification in December 2019. Classical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath but other clinical manifestations have since been described including associated dermatological and ocular manifestations. Common cutaneous signs include urticarial, erythematous and papulovesicular rashes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, whereas dry eye and conjunctivitis are the most frequently reported ophthalmic signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Erythema multiforme (EM) in association with COVID-19 has been documented in several case reports, but most present with a minor form of the disease and ocular involvement has been rare. We report a case of bilateral bulbar membranous conjunctivitis in a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related erythema multiforme major (EMM).\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A previously fit and well 18-year-old man presented to the eye casualty with 7 days of increasingly red eyes, no discharge, a feeling of heaviness around the eyes, and oral and penile ulcers. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 3 weeks earlier and had symptoms of fatigue, anosmia, headache, shortness of breath and sore throat. The eye symptoms and ulcers came on after resolution of his COVID-19 symptoms. On Day 1 of his eye symptoms, he had a remote consultation with a tertiary eye casualty and was given lubricating eye drops for presumed viral conjunctivitis. A day after this, he was prescribed oral penicillin V for a sore throat and developed the penile and mouth ulcers as soon as he took the antibiotics . His general practitioner (GP) referred him to dermatology and rheumatology for investigation.\n\n【7】He was referred for review in eye casualty from the dermatology clinic, and presented 7 days after the red eyes and 6 days after the oral and genital ulceration had begun. On examination visual acuity was 6/6 in the right and 6/9 in the left. There was diffuse injection of the bulbar conjunctiva with bilateral conjunctival pseudomembranes, but no tarsal conjunctival epithelial defect on eversion of the lid . The corneas were clear with no epithelial defects. He was started on copious lubrication, 2 hourly preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% drops, and preservative-free chloramphenicol drops 4 times a day as prophylaxis. Two days later, his symptomatology improved, and the bulbar conjunctival injection and pseudomembranes improved significantly. The patient was reviewed again by dermatology and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 associated EMM following the results of a 3-mm punch biopsy of the lower lip, which showed ulcerated skin with focal interface mucositis . He was started on prednisolone 30 mg orally for 1 week. He was advised to continue the chloramphenicol and taper down the dexamethasone drops. Two weeks later he made a full recovery. There were no ophthalmic signs and no remaining ulcers. He was advised to stop the chloramphenicol and taper off the dexamethasone drops gradually.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Mouth ulcers.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Right eye membranous conjunctivitis.

The major form is characterized by prodromal symptoms, blistering and ulceration of mucous membranes. Ocular complications can be sight-threatening and include keratitis, uveitis and conjunctival scarring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Here, we present a case of EMM associated with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ocular symptoms occurred prior to the start of a course of penicillin V, making this an unlikely trigger, although it is possible it may have contributed to the symptom severity.\n\n【14】EM is an uncommon cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19; COVID-19 related EM has predominantly been reported in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. We found only two case reports of COVID-19 related EM with ocular involvement, which were reported as a very mild conjunctival injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

Retinal metastases are less common still, presenting a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. This case observes a 66-year-old female ex-smoker presenting with unilateral painful vision loss 2 months from completion of definitive chemoradiotherapy for early-stage small cell lung cancer. A retinal lesion was discovered on examination and initially treated as viral retinitis without improvement. Two vitrectomy procedures were unable to confirm the diagnosis. Eventual retinal biopsy under general anaesthesia confirmed small cell lung cancer oligometastasis (7 months from completion of definitive chemoradiotherapy), without evidence of other sites of disease on imaging. She received local radiation to retina with resolution of eye pain. She eventually developed intrathoracic relapse of disease and was treated with palliative chemotherapy (14 months from completion of definitive chemoradiotherapy).\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Retinal metastases are rare and are often mistaken for other causes, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This case demonstrates the difficulties pursuing diagnoses for metastatic retinal lesions, including the limitations of macroscopic slit-lamp examination, radiology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with vitreous humour cytological analysis in confirming retinal metastases without definitive biopsy.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 66-year-old female presented to the emergency department with new onset haemoptysis with associated 2-month dry cough and 3 kg unintentional weight loss. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux. She presented for investigation for unexplained dyspepsia, altered bowel habit and 10 kg weight loss with normal oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy 3 years prior, diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. Surgical history included right cheek basal cell carcinoma 5 years prior, right external iliac endarterectomy 3 years prior and hysterectomy for fibroids. She was an ex-smoker (60 pack-year history) with no family history of cancer. Body mass index measured 18.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and performance status 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score) at initial presentation.\n\n【6】A left lower lobe mass on chest X-ray lead to rapid access lung clinic referral for workup. Initial bronchoscopy was inconclusive for malignancy. Computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) diagnosis. Positron emission tomography  with contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis (CT-TAP) and brain demonstrated a fluorodeoxyglucose-avid 4.9 cm mass 3 mm from the pleural surface with without lymphadenopathy or distant metastases. Multidisciplinary team consensus staged disease as cT2bN0M0 通用删除1(英):<u>(per American Joint Committee on Cancer, version 8.0)</u>. Sequential chemotherapy and definitive radiation approach were advised, accounting for the patient’s co-morbidities and objective frailty. She received Carboplatin (dosed at area under the curve 5, day 1) with Etoposide (100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , days 1–3) followed by definitive radiotherapy (40 Gy in 15 fractions). She subsequently received 25 Gy in 10 fractions prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI).\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|Initial staging positron emission tomography with CT of the thorax demonstrating a 4.9 cm fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lesion in the left lower lobe without avid lymphadenopathy or distant metastases, consistent with a primary lung malignancy of cT2bN0M0 stage per American Joint Committee on Cancer.</u>\n\n【8】Mild frontal headache and nausea occurred 1 month from completion of definitive therapy. Contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain at this time demonstrated no abnormalities. CT-TAP demonstrated primary tumour partial response (measuring 3 cm). A short steroid course improved symptoms, initially attributed to recent completion of PCI. Symptoms recurred 3 months from completion of definitive therapy with cerebellar signs, prompting admission for workup. Repeat contrast MRI brain and CT-TAP demonstrated continued response of treated primary tumour (measuring 1.3 cm) without evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases.\n\n【9】Neurology workup noted CSF and blood serum with unremarkable protein, glucose, serum protein electrophoresis, cytology, microbial culture, Ziehl–Neelsen stain, syphilis serology, herpes simplex polymerase chain reaction, serum interferon gamma assay, vasculitis and paraneoplastic screens (including anti-Hu, anti-Ro, anti-Ri), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and B12 with folate levels. Pain migrated behind the right eye over 1 month with associated unilateral visual acuity loss to hand motion, prompting ophthalmology assessment.\n\n【10】Anterior segment demonstrated shallow anterior chamber with raised intraocular pressure (IOP) of 50 mmHg. Gonioscopy demonstrated 270° angle neovascularization of the iris. Fundoscopy demonstrated creamy amorphous material, surface haemorrhage and subretinal exudation involving macula and temporal periphery  with normal vitreous and no seeding appreciated. B-scan demonstrated uniformly echogenic posterior globe mass without choroidal excavation, fluorescein angiography optic disc hyperfluorescence and contrast MRI orbital thickening of the posterolateral chamber (without post-contrast enhancement) . Consensus opinion sought from a uveitis sub-specialist agreed with the initial diagnosis of viral retinitis.

Cyclodiode therapy (2 cycles) and a course of oral valganciclovir provided limited-to-no benefit. Two pars plana vitrectomy sampling procedures performed were inconclusive for aetiology (namely malignant or infectious process). The lesion progressed over 6 months, invading the optic nerve causing retinal detachment on slit-lamp examination with progressive right ocular pain and thickening of the right globe lesion on serial MRI, concerning for a malignant process. Subretinal fluid biopsy with silicone oil tamponade was performed under general anaesthetic, 7 months from completion of definitive therapy. Histopathology demonstrated small cells, scant cytoplasm and staining for cytokeratin AE1/3 and chromogranin , consistent with SCLC oligometastasis. CSF sampling performed at the time of subretinal biopsy demonstrated no atypical cells with normal protein and glucose.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 4|删除段之间换行|Retinal fluid biopsy demonstrating small cells with scanty cytoplasm and mixed apoptotic cells staining positive for chromogranin consistent with a diagnosis of SCLC.</u>\n\n【15】Contrast MRI brain and CT-TAP at the time of confirming oligometastasis did not demonstrate any active malignancy outside the retina. The patient was treated with radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the right retina, with improvement in pain symptoms. Further systemic chemotherapy was offered after confirming oligometastasis, being advised that risk of further SCLC recurrence was high. The patient instead opted for clinical observation. She remained well until development of intrathoracic disease recurrence on CT-TAP surveillance 14 months from completion of definitive therapy and commenced palliative chemotherapy. MRI of brain and orbits at this time demonstrated post-radiation changes without intraocular or intracranial metastases.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Metastases should be suspected in definitively treated cancers when unexplained examination or radiological findings are observed. SCLC rarely metastasizes to the retina and may present as neovascular glaucoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Hyperprolactinemia can lead to various different symptoms including anorgasmia. It is important to identify any sexual dysfunction, but also any other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, in elderly patients during medical history taking and not to assume that elderly people are sexually inactive. Anorgasmia and any other sexual dysfunction in elderly can have an impact on their mental health and may even lead to depression and anxiety.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hyperprolactinemia is defined as excessive prolactin levels in the blood. Prolactin is primarily secreted from the anterior pituitary gland. The endocrine function of prolactin is to enable lactation.\n\n【4】In women of reproductive age, hyperprolactinemia may lead to secondary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and infertility. Other symptoms of hyperlactatemia include lactorrhea and anorgasmia. However, the majority of hyperprolactinemia cases remain asymptomatic.\n\n【5】Prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is primarily controlled by hypothalamus. Lactotrophs exhibit D2 receptors, which can be stimulated by dopamine. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion by binding to D2 receptors. Thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of prolactin.\n\n【6】Chest wall irritation (e.g. HZV infection or surgery) can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Other causes include prolactinoma, antipsychotic medication, anti-hypertensive treatment and renal failure amongst others, but some are idiopathic.\n\n【7】The mechanism in which herpes Zoster infection over the chest can cause hyperprolactinemia is by nerve stimulation that leads to prolactin release.\n\n【8】The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia is 0.4% in the general population and most cases are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】CASE\n----\n\n【10】A 98-year-old lady living in a residential home was referred to mental health services by her GP following concerns raised by her carers who reported she was low in mood. Her carers additionally suspected that she was planning on taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets.\n\n【11】The duty mental-health professional who assessed the referral for patient X had conducted a visit to her home. In the assessment, patient X disclosed that she was embarrassed to reveal the reason behind her mental health deterioration, despite this she was willing to talk about it because she wanted to find a solution to her problem. Patient X was started on the antidepressant Mirtazapine for her low mood; however, her mental health did not improve. She reported continuing symptoms that could be attributed to a depressive episode including insomnia, reduced appetite and an inability to relax due to feeling tense all the time.\n\n【12】Patient X revealed that from the time she started developing shingles a few weeks earlier she had been unable to reach orgasm by masturbation, but that she still had intense sexual urges. She explained that her anorgasmia had caused her anxiety and depressed mood. Patient X’s distress had led her to becoming suicidal and to wanting to harm herself by overdosing on tablets or stabbing herself. She was then admitted to an inpatient mental health unit due to her high risk of self-harm.\n\n【13】She was not responding to the antidepressant medication that was started. Her inpatient medical team conducted investigations to identify potential organic causes for patient X’s anorgasmia.\n\n【14】Interestingly, her admission blood tests revealed a raised prolactin level of 1068 ml/u. Her only symptoms attributed to hyperlactatemia were increased facial hair and anorgasmia. She also had pain over her chest which was believed to be due to her herpes zoster infection. There was no lactorrhea or breast engorgement noted on examination.\n\n【15】Recent blood tests indicated that her thyroid function, liver function, kidney function and full blood count were within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan was ordered to exclude a prolactinoma, and this was normal. She also had several physical examinations done of her genital area and pelvis to exclude a herpes infection causing sexual dysfunction. The results of these examinations were unremarkable. On physical examination of her chest, an erythematous rash with blisters was evident over her right breast, extending to her nipples. She also complained of neuropathic pain. The distribution of the rash and clinical picture was in accordance with a recent herpes zoster infection. No Breast mass was detected.\n\n【16】A medication review was made to identify any pharmacological causes of the raised prolactin levels. Patient X was on regular amlodipine for hypertension which is not known to raise prolactin levels. Because of her psychotic symptoms, patient X had been started on aripiprazole, an antipsychotic medication that is not known to cause significant raised prolactin levels (and is sometimes used as an adjunct to lower prolactin levels caused by other antipsychotics that cause raised prolactin).\n\n【17】After conducting the aforementioned investigations for raised prolactin levels, it was concluded that the patient’s hyperprolactinemia was most probably secondary to her recent herpes zoster infection/shingles, which was fairly extensive, involving the patient’s right breast and extending all the way to the nipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As the patient’s herpes infection improved with treatment, patient X’s prolactin levels also normalized gradually and her inability to orgasm resolved.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Doctors should consider the more unique possible causes of the raised prolactin levels when treating a patient with hyperprolactinemia. Any chest wall irritation can cause hyperprolactinemia due to the stimulation reflex. Examples of some of these causes are chest wall trauma, burns, surgery and herpes zoster infection.\n\n【21】It is important to consider elderly patient’s sexual wellbeing, especially if hyperprolactinemia has been detected as this may have a negative impact on their sexual health. One possible cause of sexual dysfunction is hyperprolactinemia and patients with such problems should have their prolactin levels checked. Once hyperprolactinemia is diagnosed, it is important to exclude any pituitary prolactinoma excreting excessive prolactin using MRI brain imaging. Prolactinomas are the commonest types of pituitary tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hyperprolactinemia may be a result of pregnancy, lactation, chest wall stimulation, stress, sleep, epileptic seizures, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal failure amongst other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The patient’s medications should be reviewed as certain medication groups such as antipsychotics, antidepressants as well as antihypertensive medications can cause hyperprolactinemia. Amongst these medication groups, antipsychotics are the primary pharmacological cause of hyperprolactinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is appropriate for clinicians to start psychotic patients with known hyperprolactinemia on antipsychotic medication that have a safer profile when it comes to prolactin levels. The consultant responsible for patient X’s care appropriately chose the second-generation antipsychotic Aripiprazole because of the fact that the prolactin levels are less likely to be affected by this medication.\n\n【24】In patient X’s case, the only explanation remaining for her hyperprolactinemia was the herpes infection across her right breast. The onset of her sexual dysfunction also coincided with the onset of her herpes infection.\n\n【25】The cause of this 98-year-old patient’s mental health deterioration was her anorgasmia, which was a result of hyperprolactinemia caused by irritation to her chest wall from a recent herpes infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I am grateful to staff at Scadbury ward, Oxleas NHS Trust, for their safe and appropriate management of the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical approval not required.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent has been gained, and consent form was signed by the patient.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Sarah Moslehi is the guarantor of this case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:01:26", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:01:38", "cost": 12.266}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:01:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:01:26"}

Further studies are required to inform on management.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】The following report details the case of a previously fit patient who developed an aorto-oesophageal fistula (AEF) following date pit consumption.

Optimum management remains debated and is not evidence-based due to the low number of cases.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 76-year old female, previously fit and well, was admitted to hospital with new onset melaena. Two weeks prior she had accidentally swallowed a date pit. Seventy-two hours prior to admission she developed odynophagia and 24 h prior to admission she experienced a syncopal episode and hematemesis. She had no risk factors for gastro-intestinal bleeding. Following one night in hospital, the patient developed large volume haematemesis, hypotension and increased work of breathing. She was subsequently intubated due to airway compromise. A Blakemore tube was inserted, with both oesophageal and gastric balloons inflated, and traction applied. The haemorrhaging continued and a massive transfusion protocol was activated. The patient was referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she continued to haemorrhage profusely.\n\n【7】No obvious bleeding point was identified in the stomach or duodenum at endoscopy. A small, bleeding lesion was visualized on the oesophageal mucosa ~20 cm from the incisors. Attempts to control the haemorrhaging through localized adrenaline injection were unsuccessful. Computed tomography (CT) angiography was planned to identify a bleeding point. Profuse bleeding continued to the point of haemodynamic instability. The Blakemore tube was once again placed in the oesophagus and inflated to 30 mmHg. A total of 32 units of packed red blood cells, 20 units of fresh frozen plasma, three units of platelets and two units of cryoprecipitate were given. Control was eventually established by deflating the Blakemore tube and pulling it distally to the approximate site of the lesion. The oesophageal balloon was inflated to 100 mmHg and the gastric balloon was inflated to a lesser pressure.\n\n【8】Computed tomography angiography (CTA) identified a large abnormal ‘vessel’ projecting from the medial aspect of the aortic arch extending towards the oesophageal wall . This structure did not have an aneurysmal configuration and was blind-ending . No discrete vascular ring was observed, and the anatomy of the great vessels was normal . Although tubular in nature, a mycotic aneurysm could not be ruled out. Takayasu’s arteritis was also considered. The atypical ‘vessel’ did not extend to the pulmonary artery as expected of a patent ductus arteriosus. Following discussion, it was concluded that the vascular abnormality was most likely a fistula tract between the oesophagus and aortic arch caused by a foreign body.

The swallowing of sharp, jagged objects, most commonly fish and chicken bones in adults, can lead to oesophageal and aortic perforation due to the close proximity of the two structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As in this case, foreign bodies or ulcerations causing fistulae are typically found 25–30 cm from the incisors where the oesophageal diameter narrows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The cervical oesophagus, at the level of the cricopharyngeus, and the thoracic oesophagus, at the level of the aortic arch, are the two most common sites as this is where the aorta is in closest proximity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The first reported case was in 1818 but treatment was not considered until the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The first successfully treated case was described in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with AEF are typically asymptomatic initially before presenting with the ‘Chiari triad’ of mid-thoracic pain, sentinel arterial haemorrhage and massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is usually clinical and at least 45% of patients will present in this manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Reports of dysphagia and odynophagia can be a forewarning for imminent massive haemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Seventy-five percent of AEFs are due to aneurysm of the thoracic aorta with 9.7% of thoracic aortic aneurysms rupturing into the oesophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Neoplastic processes, trauma, previous mediastinal surgery and aortic interventions are other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】As in this case, it is recommended that a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube be used to control haemorrhage until definitive surgical management occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There have been no reported cases of survival from AEF with medical management alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Classical management of AEF was surgical correction with aortic cross clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass and simultaneous resection and repair of the thoracic oesophagus, although open repair has a 45–55% mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Endovascular techniques have recently been used to treat AEF without the need for sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was attempted. Previous studies have reported that TEVAR is a fast and safe method to treat AEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It can obtain haemorrhage control acutely, reduce morbidity and mortality, and has high technical success rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, TEVAR as a definitive procedure alone, versus as a short-term measure before open surgical repair, is still debated due to questions of durability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. While the minimally invasive technique provides the primary goal of therapy (rapid control of bleeding), the method does not address the digestive tract defect, and the graft is directly exposed to a contaminated environment. Thus, the risk for stent graft infection, fistula recurrence, persistent mediastinitis and sepsis is not insignificant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A systematic review by Canaud _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> demonstrated the presence of microorganisms in 43.2%, a recurrence rate of 13.8% and stent graft infection in 15.2% of the cases evaluated. The literature emphasizes the importance of long-term antibiotics in TEVAR cases to mitigate this risk, but some authors still stress that TEVAR alone cannot replace surgical debridement of the infected mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Long-term successful repair can be achieved using a combination of closed and open repair. Some authors describe TEVAR as a bridge therapy followed by a delayed open repair, once the patient is more stable, for debridement of the infected mediastinum, repair of the oesophageal defect, with or without stent graft exploration and reconstruction of the aortic wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>K M Lichtenstein, T B Russell, J B Lichtenstein and H P Brar report that there are no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nil.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient is deceased so obtaining consent for this report was not possible.

We describe a 42-year-old healthy male who developed sudden loss of consciousness during an air flight, with an incidental finding of a giant lung bulla.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 42-year-old army man presented with a sudden loss of consciousness for 30 minutes during an air flight that had ascended to 4000 meters above sea level. The loss of consciousness was associated with left arm and left truncal twitching with no eye-rolling, tongue-biting, or bowel and bladder incontinence. Before the loss of consciousness, he experienced frontal headache and dizziness. He did not report any chest pain or difficulty in breathing. He denied a history of smoking, illicit drug use, or trauma. He had traveled by air several times before, most recently being 2 months before the current complaint; however, he never experienced any complications.\n\n【7】On admission, he was fully conscious with stable vitals. His neurology examination revealed facial asymmetry with reduced power of the left upper limb though the tone and reflexes were intact. There were reduced breath sounds on the upper and middle zones of the left lung. His laboratory blood workup was not significant and the serology for HIV and α-1 antitrypsin were negative. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal. His chest x-ray revealed a giant left lung bulla . Chest CT revealed a single giant bulla in the left upper lobe, occupying nearly a third of the left hemithorax suggesting a giant apical bullous emphysema .\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Supine chest x-ray shows a large thin-walled cavity in the left upper lobe occupying more than one-third of the affected hemithorax.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Axial (A), Coronal (B), and Sagittal (C) chest CT lung window shows a thin-walled cavitary lesion with thin septations in the apex of the left upper lobe measuring 11.1 cm (AP) x 9.5 cm (T) x 10.9 cm (CC) in size.</u>\n\n【10】A day after his admission, the neurological symptoms had started to regress and his left upper limb weakness had subsided. Since the patient was not having any respiratory complaint or compromise, the patient was observed for a few days without any change in his respiratory system. The patient was saturating well on room air. An option for bullectomy was brought up but the patient refused as he saw himself as fit. He was counseled on the complications of the disease and was discharged. He has been lost to follow-up.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】Patients with giant lung bulla typically present with sudden onset difficulty in breathing or chest pain with suspicion of tension pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but rarely loss of consciousness. Our case describes a healthy middle-aged non-smoker without prior history of lung disease presenting with loss of consciousness during an air flight. In chronic pulmonary disease, a patient may have poor lung ventilation or pulmonary hypertension which may contribute to a decline of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) with hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In healthy people, vasoconstriction redistributes pulmonary blood flow to the lung apex, which may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which could help to maintain the PaO <sub>2 </sub> during air travel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Since the left lung apex was compromised in our case, this might have led to a hypoxic event hence loss of consciousness. However, there have been reports of ruptured giant lung bulla during air travel. In such circumstances, the air enters the blood circulation causing cerebral air embolism and neurological deficit such as loss of consciousness and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient had a facial asymmetry with left arm weakness which may have been attributed to a cerebral air embolism although the brain CT was normal. The left-arm weakness may be neuropathic through a direct pressure effect upon the brachial plexus from the expanding bulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】As altitude increases, both atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen and barometric pressure decrease. At 10668 meters (35 000 feet), the actual atmospheric pressure is 179 mmHg, whereas pressurization of the cabin on commercial airliners maintains cabin atmospheric pressures around 564 mmHg (2438 meters/8000 feet). There is an approximate 38% increase in the volume of air in a non-communicating body cavity upon ascent from sea level to the maintained cabin atmospheric pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As Boyle’s law states the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is exposed, therefore, as barometric pressure falls in the aircraft cabin during the ascent, the bulla will expand. The expanded bulla will stretch its wall and compress the surrounding lung causing rupture of the bulla, pneumothorax, and air embolism causing respiratory or neurological complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Lung bullae are best detected on CT imaging as it gives more description on the number, size, and position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in previous literature though it is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Eventually, bullectomy is recommended in symptomatic patients with giant lung bulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In conclusion, giant lung bulla is a rare cause of loss of consciousness. Though an air embolus was not detected on brain CT imaging, it was likely a hypoxic event that led to the loss of consciousness in our case. This may be suspected when patients lose consciousness during air travel.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient for his patience and cooperation.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The need for ethical approval was waived.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A.S. is the nominated guarantor.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:19:37", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:24:09", "cost": 272.493}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:24:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:19:37"}

We present here the case of a middle-aged man with history of unprovoked DVT in the right lower extremity (RLE), presenting for acute DVT in the same limb.\n\n【11】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【12】A 42-year-old man with history of asthma, and two episodes of unprovoked RLE DVTs not on anticoagulation, presented to the emergency department after 3 days of progressive bilateral lower extremity swelling and pain.\n\n【13】The patient denied any recent trauma, travel history, prolonged immobilization, surgery or shortness of breath. He was a former smoker with 20 pack-year history, but denied illicit drug use. He has no pertinent family history, including history of coagulopathies. His first episode of RLE DVT occurred at 35 years of age and was treated with 6 months of warfarin 5 mg daily. The second unprovoked DVT episode occurred 5 years later and patient was then placed on lifelong anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, but reports stopping medication after 10 months. Workup for underlying thrombophilia or etiology was complicated by poor health care follow-up with both prior DVT’s.\n\n【14】On physical exam, patient had bilateral lower extremity edema up to the thighs (right worse than left) that were warm to touch and tender to palpation. Tortuous veins were found in the posterior aspect of the legs bilaterally up to the mid-thigh, as well as chronic venous skin changes. Duplex US of RLE showed chronic DVT of the proximal and mid-femoral vein and an acute DVT of the distal femoral and popliteal veins. US also showed dampened respiratory variation in the right common femoral vein concerning for a proximal DVT. Subsequently, a pelvic CT scan was obtained to rule out proximal DVT and incidentally showed absent infrarenal segment of the IVC with dilation of the iliac, ascending lumbar, azygous and hemiazygos veins . During this time, extensive thrombophilia workup including prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, homocysteine, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and beta-glycoprotein was negative.\n\n【15】The patient was treated with rivaroxaban 15 mg twice a day for 21 days, and then switched to 20 mg daily thereafter, with compression stocking. One month after hospitalization, the patient was seen in the emergency department with persistent RLE pain. Repeat duplex US demonstrated chronic DVT involving the proximal and mid-femoral vein in addition to proximal popliteal veins. Given concern for anticoagulation failure and the presence of an anatomical vascular abnormality, the patient was referred to the vascular surgery for consideration of an interventional procedure. Patient was deemed not appropriate for any surgical intervention, given the high rate of morbidity and was recommended to continue on lifelong anticoagulation and management of chronic varicose veins with elastic compression stockings.\n\n【16】The patient was seen 2 months later in the medical clinic and was found to have resolution of symptoms and repeat lower extremity duplex US was negative for acute or chronic DVT bilaterally.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】IVC agenesis often is diagnosed in young patients presenting with unprovoked DVT and has been reported to be in association with kidney and IVC abnormalities with leg thrombosis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】During embryogenesis, the IVC derives from three separate segments of embryonic veins: posterior cardinal, subcardinal and supracardinal veins. If abnormal regression or persistence of this embryonic vein occurs, various abnormalities of the IVC can develop including complete absence, partial absence or presence of bilateral IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the absence of the infrarenal IVC, venous return from iliac veins will drain directly into the azygos and hemiazygos venous systems. Since the azygos and hemiazygos veins are considered low caliber, collaterals can develop to permit adequate venous outflow from lower extremities. If the collateral system fails despite compensatory enlargement, it can impede blood return, which can lead to increased risk for thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Patients that present with unprovoked DVTs require thorough investigation for underlying malignancy and thrombophilia disorders. Of note, screening tests for thrombophilia disorders can be impacted by anticoagulants and should be performed after discontinuing vitamin K antagonists for 2 weeks or direct oral anticoagulants for 2–3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. To date, there are limited reports on the clinical association of unprovoked DVT and IVC agenesis in otherwise healthy middle-aged adults. One of the largest reports is from Lambert _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> in which they reviewed 72 patients, 10 of which were their original patients, with IVC agenesis and DVT in an effort to document the clinical spectrum of disease. This study demonstrated that a majority of patients were young males (<40 years of age) who developed proximal DVT after intense physical exertion. They also reported that 35.4–60% of patients presented with bilateral DVT, whereas pulmonary embolism was present in 0.0–9.97% of patients. Thus, in young males with unprovoked DVT, it is recommended to rule out vascular abnormalities, particularly in those with proximal thrombosis with unclear etiology.\n\n【21】Limited evidence is available regarding the best treatment and duration for DVT secondary to IVC agenesis. However, most of the studies report good response with prolonged oral anticoagulation combined lifestyle modification, including leg elevation and compression stocking. There is evidence of DVT recurrence after anticoagulation discontinuation; therefore, lifelong anticoagulation should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of IVC agenesis in a middle-aged adult presenting with multiple unprovoked DVTs with poor medical compliance. We advocate for a thorough workup at initial presentation in patients with unprovoked DVTs and recommend lifelong anticoagulation therapy and routine follow-up in those found to have ICV agenesis to prevent recurrence as such in this patient.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors participated in the preparation and writing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was obtained for the elaboration and publication of the article.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>V.E.P. is the guarantor of submission.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:27", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:04:32", "cost": 5.148}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:04:25"}

Mild forms of non-inflammatory EBA are characterized by skin lesions and have gained great relevance in the literature. However, resistant inflammatory EBA with widespread mucosal involvement remains a rare entity given its low prevalence. It commonly represents a great burden for the patient’s quality of life with most cases being resistant to different therapeutic modalities. We present a case of resistant inflammatory EBA with esophageal strictures that improved after therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a well-defined acquired autoimmune disease that results from autoantibodies against anchoring fibrils within the basement membrane of collagen type VII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It can be divided into two subtypes: non-inflammatory and inflammatory. Non-inflammatory is the most common subtype, limited to skin lesions in body prone areas. In contrast, the inflammatory subtype has a widespread involvement and affects the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, larynx and esophagus. However, gastrointestinal tract involvement is rare, and its incidence is too low to be determined. We present an uncommon case presentation of EBA with esophageal strictures that improved with dilation, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and rituximab (RTX) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 71-year-old female with EBA and history of Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the right orbit in remission presented with non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting; associated dysphagia, odynophagia and unintentional weight loss of 8 lbs in the last 1 month. Physical exam was significant for scattered skin bullae throughout the body. There were oral ulcerations without visible thrush. The patient was started on lidocaine and Maalox cocktail, sucralfate and proton pump inhibitor with partial relief of symptoms. Barium swallow esophagram evidenced multiple stenotic areas . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed revealing extensive palate and laryngeal ulcers , along with erosive lesions and esophageal stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus . The lower esophagus and stomach were spared. The stenotic areas were successfully dilated with Savary dilators. Biopsy revealed ulcerative esophagitis with acute and chronic areas of inflammation that resulted negative for metaplasia, viral and fungal infections . The patient was initiated on IVIg and continued RTX with symptoms improvement.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|Barium swallow esophagram with multiple areas of stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Multiple shallow ulcers in the oropharynx.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Area of stenosis in the upper third of the esophagus with sloughing of the surrounded mucosa.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 4**|删除段之间换行|( **a** ) Biopsy from the lower third of the esophagus.

Two months before presentation, the patient was started on RTX given the severe, non-remitting course of her EBA. The patient remained in complete remission with no further mucosal involvement for 5 months after the initial presentation and completing 5 cycles of IVIg, and RTX. On follow-up skin biopsy, dermatopathology analysis by immunofluorescence showed no deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA or C3 in the epidermis, dermis, basement membrane zone and vessels of the oral mucosa. The patient was discharged with dermatology and gastroenterology (GI) follow-up. No further GI symptoms were reported after 9 months of follow-up visits.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】EBA has a worldwide annual prevalence of 0.2% per 1 million people. It has been previously associated with Crohn’s disease (in 25–30% of reported cases), ulcerative colitis, along with other autoimmune disorders such as B cell lymphoma, amyloidosis, thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diabetes; out of which, the first three have only been proven by research trials. Histopathological analysis has shown evidence of circulating tissue antibodies against type VII collagen in B cell lymphoma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The treatment for EBA depends on the extent of the blistering lesions and their effect on the patient’s quality of life. First-line therapy for mild (local) disease is local vs systemic steroids; or steroid-sparing agents such as colchicine, dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. The classic feature of inflammatory EBA is the mucosal extension of the blistering lesions, which has been reported in 20% of cases and can be life-threatening. This subtype tends to be refractory to steroids and steroid-sparing agents. Nevertheless, IVIg along with other therapies such as humanized anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies (RTX) have shown positive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Gastrointestinal involvement of EBA is uncommon. The clinical presentation consists of multiple blisters and ulcer formation in the oral mucosa and palate region with progressive dysphagia, and/or odynophagia. There has been an established relationship between esophageal webs and EBA, reported in 6% of cases. The esophageal blistering/scarring process leads to the formation of fibrotic mucosa and esophageal stenosis. Management often encompasses dietary modification, sequential esophageal dilations with a balloon catheter or a bougie, and a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support. In one study with 53 patients, a total of 182 dilations were performed over a median follow-up period of 3.5 years. In total, 95% of the patients improved in the dysphagia score and weight. Possible risks are esophageal rupture and re-stenosis. Overall, endoscopic dilation is a safe procedure that provides symptom relief and improvement of the quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】One meta-analysis designed to study the efficacy of various treatments on remission showed that all EBA cases had a satisfactory response to IVIG and RTX independent of the disease severity. In a subgroup analysis, EBA with mucosal involvement was associated with complete remission. Furthermore, RTX and IVIG exhibited the best profile outcome for complete remission in severe EBA. However, it is not clear which mechanism RTX and IVIg use to execute their effect over susceptible autoantigenic B cell lymphocytes. IVIg is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its ability to eliminate clinical autoimmunity and restore physiologic homeostasis. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. These two agents might have a synergistic effect, but additional trials with larger samples are required. The length of therapy with IVIg and RTX is still controversial but expert consensus suggests that multiple cycles are necessary with a minimum length of 1 month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The goal of treatment is to control the disease and to avoid new lesion formation. The EBA inflammatory subtype prognosis is poor and 1-year remission off medication has not been widely proven in previous trials. Complete remission is uncommon without at least short courses of medical therapy. Hence, moderate to long-term intensity therapies are needed in most cases to achieve lesser disease activity and remission. Severe forms of EBA have an unfavorable remission profile with frequent exacerbations and rapid scarring, negatively affecting the patient’s quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our patient had a typical course of inflammatory EBA with GI mucosal involvement. Her condition was refractory to conventional therapy, but later achieved remission for more than 5 months after combination therapy with RTX and IV immunoglobulin.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Hilary Hertan.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No ethical approval was required.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent provided was obtained from the patient.

She was a life-long non-smoker and worked as a medical transcriptionist. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules. She was placed on prednisone 40 mg daily for presumed sarcoidosis. At three months she reported subjective improvement, however a repeat chest CT confirmed persistence of bilateral lung nodules and circumferential mural thickening and narrowing the central airways . She ultimately underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy of a right upper lobe lung nodule. The pathological examination demonstrated lung parenchyma with features consistent with amyloid deposition. Specimen was sent to Mayo Clinic to perform laser-capture microdissection with liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry for amyloid typing, which identified κ light chain as the amyloidogenic protein. Prednisone was tapered off, and she was referred to our institute for further management.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 1**|删除段之间换行|(a) Chest CT shows multiple bilateral lung nodules, some with central calcifications (arrowhead) and variable-sized cysts  in all lung lobes.

(b) Chest CT angiography shows diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage (in the setting of hemoptysis) with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and cysts. Note, presence of endobronchial soft-tissues within RML segmental and subsegmental bronchi .</u>\n\n【8】Her complete blood count, kidney function and calcium level were within normal limit. Serum free light chain assay was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis was positive for M-protein (0.98 mg/dL). Serum immunofixation revealed mildly elevated IgG \\[1620 mg/dL (ref. 717–1411 mg/dL)\\] and κ level \\[1290 mg/dL (ref. 534–1267 mg/dL)\\]. A 24-hour urine protein was normal and no M-protein was identified on urine protein electrophoresis. Troponin and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide were normal. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction with normal diastolic function. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of clonal plasma cells. Given normal serum light chain assay, normal bone marrow biopsy, and lack of systemic involvement, she was diagnosed with localized AL amyloidosis involving the lung. She was also diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) based on positive serum M-protein. No treatment was started, and she was followed with hematology/oncology every 6 months. Of note, bronchoscopy was initially not performed because airway involvement was not reported on the initial CT and the patient was largely asymptomatic when the follow-up chest CT reported evident airway involvement.\n\n【9】Four years later, she developed an episode of hemoptysis. Chest CT angiography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and airway involvement . She underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed multiple yellowish plaques in the mucosal areas involving the subglottic space, trachea, segmental and subsegmental bronchi and a number of infiltrative nodules . Endobronchial biopsies were performed. Pathology of fragments of bronchial mucosa showed extensive amyloid deposits on Congo red stain, consistent with endobronchial amyloidosis . She was treated with bronchoscopic therapy twice at 3 months interval using argon plasma coagulation with resolution of symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 2**|删除段之间换行|Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy shows multiple yellowish plaques  and raised nodular infiltration  of airway mucosa in (a) right upper lobe (b) right middle lobe.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>**Figure 3**|删除段之间换行|Photomicrographs of the endobronchial biopsy (a) deposits of amorphous, eosinophilic, waxy-like material (A) with ossification (B), underlying the bronchial epithelium (arrow), H&E, 10x.

She was incidentally noted to have an enlarged right submandibular salivary gland on CT imaging and underwent biopsy in December 2016, which revealed AL (κ) amyloid deposition. By the time this manuscript was being prepared, she remained asymptomatic. She has had stable MGUS with faint serum M protein (0.99 mg/dL) and mildly elevated serum free κ light chain \\[25.5 mg/L (ref. 3.3–19.4 mg/L)\\] on the most recent follow-up studies.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Pulmonary amyloidosis can be localized or part of systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Based on the anatomic site of involvement, pulmonary amyloidosis can be classified into 3 forms: nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, tracheobronchial amyloidosis and diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The former two are usually seen in localized pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nodular amyloidosis is slightly more prevalent than tracheobronchial amyloidosis. In a cases series of 55 patients with pulmonary amyloidosis reported by Mayo Clinic from 1980 to 1993, 11 patients had localized pulmonary amyloidosis. Among them, 7 patients had nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, and 4 patients had tracheobronchial amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Both lung parenchymal and tracheobronchial amyloidosis can be seen in systemic amyloidosis, but rarely present together in localized forms of pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In an autopsy study of 11 patients who had lung involvement of systemic amyloidosis, amyloid deposition was found in both alveolar and tracheobronchial mucosa in all 7 patients in whom both alveolar and tracheobronchial histologic examination were available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Only 1 case reported a large solitary pulmonary amyloid tumor protruding into the bronchus lumen, however it did not mention if that patient had systemic or localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, although amyloid deposition was noted in the parotid gland, there was no evidence of other systemic involvement, thus the patient was thought to have localized amyloidosis.\n\n【15】Localized AL amyloidosis generally has an excellent long-term prognosis and rarely evolves into systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In a study of 606 patients with localized amyloidosis (defined as amyloid deposition at one non-vital organ site and with no evidence of systemic organ involvement such as heart, kidney, liver, nerve or tongue), including 35 cases (6%) with tracheobronchial amyloidosis and 47 cases (8%) of nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, only 7 patients (1%) progressed to systemic amyloidosis at a median follow-up of 74 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with isolated lymph node amyloidosis and excess of free light chains are at increased risk of progression to systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

She was diagnosed with L5 discitis and suspected infective endocarditis complicating a _Staphylococcus aureus_ blood stream infection (BSI). Transoesophageal echo had shown a mobile echo density on the aortic valve and the diagnosis of discitis was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was no clear source of the bacteraemia. The patient reported a significant history of chills and fevers for 1 week post coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. There was no evidence of collection at the site of vaccination. The _S.aureus_ blood culture isolate was susceptible to flucloxacillin. She was commenced on 2 g of flucloxacillin 4 hourly along with 1 g of IV paracetamol four times daily for analgesia. This regimen continued for 2 weeks with an appropriate response clinically and biochemically. The only side-effect of treatment noted was persistent nausea, developing around Day 10.\n\n【6】The patient’s condition began to deteriorate on Day 16, with increasing nausea and several episodes of vomiting. She became hypotensive, dyspnoeic and developed a reduction in her urine output. The biochemistry results demonstrated a new acute kidney injury (AKI) with creatinine rising from 78 to 160 μmol/L. Blood gas showed a pH of 7.29, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.3 kPa and a bicarbonate of 15 mmol/L. Lactate was normal. These results were consistent with a high anion gap acidosis (HAGMA) of 26 mEq/L. Alternative causes of acute deterioration with these symptoms and biochemistry, such as sepsis, were considered and excluded. PGA was suspected due to the treatment regimen alongside the biochemical indices. The nausea and vomiting were a response to low pH and the dyspnoea was an attempt to eliminate CO <sub>2 </sub> as compensation for the acidosis.\n\n【7】Diagnosis of PGA was confirmed with urine showing the presence of inorganic acids. Paracetamol was stopped and flucloxacillin was changed to a cephalosporin (Cefurxime). The patient’s symptoms resolved and blood gas parameters normalized after 48 hours. However, she developed significant adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression and an allergic reaction to second- and third-line antimicrobial agents. These also had inadequate or suboptimal anti-staphylococcal cover and her inflammatory markers began to rise. Noscomial infection was ruled out at this stage with appropriate screening tests. A repeat MRI at 6 weeks demonstrated ongoing active infection at the L5 region. A reintroduction of flucloxacillin without paracetamol was successful and the patient completed another 6 week course with no further complications. Repeat MRI showed significant improvements in discitis.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】The risk of PGA secondary to the interaction between flucloxacillin and paracetamol is poorly recognized in clinical practice and literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

Both paracetamol and flucloxacillin interact with the gamma-glutamyl cycle as outlined below and in Figure 1 :\n\n【11】*   1) Paracetamol contributes to cysteine deficiency through direct conjugation. The paracetamol metabolite, N-acetyl-P-benzoquinonimine binds irreversibly to glutathione. When glutathione levels are depleted, the feedback inhibition is removed resulting in the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine and the formation of 5-oxoproline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】*   2) Flucloxacillin inhibits 5-oxoprolinase, preventing degradation of pyroglutamic acid to glutamate.

We present an as-of-yet unreported case of actinomycosis in an 81-year-old gentleman who was found to have right-sided peritonitis and small bowel obstruction 11 months after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A complex loculated lesion was found on laparotomy with a protracted course of antibiotics being needed for treatment. The rarity of this condition will mean it remains a surprise diagnosis to many clinicians. However, it is important that clinicians maintain some index of suspicion to prevent unnecessary surgery and are aware of the protracted course of antibiotics that is needed for successful treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Actinomycosis refers to a progressive suppurative and granulomatous disease process attributed to a member of the actinomyces family; of which, _Actinomyces israelii_ is the most common causative organism. These microaerophilic bacteria are usually contained within the gastrointestinal, oral and genitourinary tracts, although if the mucosa is breached they can give rise to pathology. The common sites for infection are cervico-facial (60%), abdomen (20%) and pelvis (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with a subacute to chronic infective course possibly due to the relapsing and remitting nature of actinomycosis. As a result, it can take many years for actinomycosis to present clinically.\n\n【4】To further complicate the clinical features of abdominal actinomycosis, any organ within the abdomen can be affected as tissue planes can be crossed and fistulae or sinuses formed. Unsurprisingly, actinomycosis has been confused with tumours, inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, diverticular disease and peri-anal pathology. Various case reports reflect on pseudotumour-like syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, intra-abdominal collections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and varying degrees of peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This has led to actinomycosis being described as ‘a master of disguise’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】There have also been reports of iatrogenic actinomycosis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>. These case series all report biliary spillage, a lost stone or a gangrenous gall bladder at the time of surgery. Nevertheless, although such spillage is a relatively common intraoperative occurrence, progression to actinomycosis is rare. We present an as-of-yet unreported but life-threatening presentation of actinomycosis peritonitis in a patient with a recent history of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 81-year-old male was admitted to hospital with a 1-day history of faeculent vomiting and a 3-week history of a change in his bowel habit. He also described right-sided rib and hip pain, which required opiate analgesia prescribed by his general practitioner. On direct questioning, he admitted two stones of unintentional weight loss. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation (on warfarin) and hypertension. He had undergone an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy 11 months earlier for gallstone disease. At the time of surgery, there was minimal bile and stone debris spillage, which was nevertheless thoroughly irrigated and washed out.\n\n【8】On this admission, he was apyrexial, normotensive and normocardiac. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension with generalized abdominal pain and right flank/right upper quadrant peritonitis. Bowel sounds were absent, and rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. Laboratory testing revealed a high leucocyte count of 22.7 (10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and a C-reactive protein of 290 (mg/l). Plane abdominal and chest radiographs showed dilated loops of proximal small bowel and faecal loading; however, no evidence of pneumoperitoneum was present. A subsequent abdominal CT scan confirmed this pattern of bowel dilatation and while no clear cut-off point was visible, a right sub-hepatic multiloculated collection extending down the right lateral abdominal was seen . Generalized pneumobilia was also noted .\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1:|删除段之间换行|A complex and loculated collection almost surrounding the liver and tracking down the right paracolic gutter. Faecal loading is also noted.</u>\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2:|删除段之间换行|Peri-hepatic fluid is shown with marked pneumobilia present.</u>\n\n【11】With both the clinical and radiographic pictures pointing towards small bowel obstruction in the presence of a collection, perforation, ischaemia and underlying tumour were all possible differential diagnoses despite the CT findings. Due to the clinical uncertainty and the presence of obstruction, it was felt that the patient should undergo emergency laparotomy rather than percutaneous drainage of the collection to help identify and rectify the underlying pathology and relieve the obstruction. However, during the procedure, no perforation was found. The large purulent right upper quadrant collection was identified. Pus was aspirated and sent for microbiological culture, but was not examined for sulphur granules nor retained for subsequent examination. No other gross pathology was found, and a thorough abdominal lavage was performed. His postoperative improvement was slow and complicated by significant sepsis requiring intensive care admission for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and inotropic support. Eight days later, _A. israelii_ was isolated , and under microbiological guidance, treatment with tazobactam and piperacillin (Tazocin™) 4.5 g three times daily was continued.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 3:|删除段之间换行|Image of the species of _A. israelii_ grown.</u>\n\n【13】After completing a 2-week course, he was discharged home with a further 2-week course of intravenous Tazocin, followed by oral penicillin. Routine blood testing by the general practitioner showed persistently raised inflammatory markers. A repeat ultrasound scan of the abdomen at 8 weeks post discharge revealed a collection of extra-luminal fluid adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall measuring 8 × 9 × 7 cm. This was drained under ultrasound guidance, and the patient commenced on a further 3-month course of oral penicillin after which he made a full recovery.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Intra-abdominal actinomycosis is a rare complication of abdominal surgery with a variety of presentations from subacute infection to florid peritonitis with obstruction. The period between insult and presentation can vary from 1 to 11 years due to its low virulence potential and a relapsing–remitting course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Yet it is not just the rarity of actinomycosis that complicates its diagnosis. The presenting symptoms are usually non-specific including pain, malaise, fever, weight loss and the pressure effect of the granuloma on adjacent structures. Even when the disease process is identified, culture of Actinomyces is negative in up to 76% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The precipitating causes described in the literature are also broad, and include appendicitis, diverticulitis, intestinal perforation, trauma, bowel infarction, haemorrhage, cholecystitis, use of interuterine devices and bowel surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The severity of infective sequelae means that clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion for two reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention, although preoperative microbiological culture may not be possible. Secondly, without prolonged and specific antibiotic treatment, relapse can occur causing further morbidity and mortality. Suggested treatment regimens include surgical drainage and removal of affected tissue, with a 6- to 12-month course of high-dose penicillin.\n\n【17】In summary, although both perforation causing sepsis and pseudotumour-like obstruction are recognized in the literature, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first account of bowel obstruction caused by intra-abdominal sepsis in the absence of perforation. We feel that the most likely source of sepsis was either bile or stone fragment spillage, or transposition of bacteria while the gallbladder was inflamed. The rarity of actinomycosis means it will continue to be a surprise diagnosis in a majority of cases.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Mark Alexander, Consultant Radiologist, Department of Radiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital and also Dr Rohinton Mulla, Consultant Microbiologist, Department of Microbiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 15:35:40", "endTime": "2024/09/09 15:37:31", "cost": 110.26}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 23:37:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 23:35:39"}

However, cytotoxic chemotherapy might help control CD during the treatment period. Here, we report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer. A 39-year-old woman with CD controlled by infliximab and mesalazine was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Infliximab treatment was discontinued temporarily so that the patient could receive NAC. However, her CD symptoms intensified during chemotherapy, and after her symptoms improved after a one-time administration of infliximab, the remainder of NAC was completed with a corticosteroid. Bilateral breast conservation surgery was performed. Histopathological examination revealed partial response of the left breast cancer and no residual cancer in the right breast. Breast irradiation and hormone therapy were added and no signs of recurrence have been observed for 5 years. CD has been well controlled with adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. When a patient with CD is diagnosed with breast cancer, the management of both CD and breast cancer can be challenging. Generally, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (infliximab, adalimumab) for CD should be stopped during chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, because the use of anti-TNF agents, especially during treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, may cause severe immunosuppression. Previous reports suggested that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission during cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer after interruption of infliximab.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 39-year-old pre-menopausal woman had CD, which has been well controlled by 5-mg/kg intravenous infliximab every 8 weeks and 2000 mg per day oral mesalazine for the last 7 years. She was referred to our hospital due to complaints of a palpable mass in the left breast. She had no family history.\n\n【6】Breast examination revealed a 3.5-cm lump in the left breast without swollen axillary lymph nodes. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 50-mm mass in the left breast and an 18-mm lesion in the right breast . Core needle biopsy (CNB) of the left breast tumor revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 5%. CNB of the right breast tumor revealed ductal carcinoma in situ that was ER-positive, PgR-positive and HER2-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 7%. Computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy showed no findings of distant metastasis. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. BRCA genetic test was not performed because she had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. PI3K test and NGS were not performed because these were not covered by national health insurance in Japan.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 1|删除段之间换行|MRI findings; (A) initial breast MRI of the bilateral breast tumor; (B) tumor in the left breast after 4 cycles of taxane; (C) tumor in the left breast after the completion of NAC.</u>\n\n【8】NAC consisting of taxane and anthracycline was scheduled to enable breast-conservation surgery, after temporary discontinuation of infliximab. She received NAC with 4 cycles of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks and was treated with mesalazine for CD. The left breast tumor decreased to 30 mm . However, at that time, she complained of slight-to-moderate abdominal distension and diarrhea 4–5 times per day and severe fatigue for 1 week. There were no other symptoms including fever or weight loss. Abdominal CT revealed mild ileus caused by small intestine stenosis , and her C-reactive protein level was 0.17 mg/dl, while her baseline was 0.01 mg/dl. The CD activity index was moderately active, which indicates exacerbated CD. NAC was temporarily interrupted, and 250-mg infliximab was administered once. CD remission was induced in 1 week. Eight weeks later, NAC consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks was resumed with 40-mg predonine for CD. After the completion of NAC, the left breast tumor decreased to 8 mm . The patient underwent bilateral partial mastectomy and left sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection. Histopathological examination of surgical specimens showed a 40-mm IDC in the left breast and no residual cancer in the right breast.\n\n删除1:<u>Figure 2|删除段之间换行|CT findings; abdominal CT showed mild ileus.</u>\n\n【10】After surgery, she received adjuvant radiation therapy to both breasts and has remained on tamoxifen and leuprorelin. She has survived without any signs of breast cancer recurrence for 5 years. Her CD has also been well controlled by adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】This is a case report of CD relapse during NAC for breast cancer after interruption of infliximab. A breast cancer diagnosis in a patient with CD increases the difficulty in managing the treatment of both CD and breast cancer. The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization guideline suggested that anti-TNF agents should be stopped during chemotherapy because of their ability to aggravate the bone marrow suppression induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Previous studies reported that the risk of CD relapse after anti-TNF agent withdrawal ranged from 30 to 40% at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and that patients in long-standing stable remission probably had a lower risk of relapse after anti-TNF cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Axelrad _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission by causing cell death or preventing cell division in rapidly dividing cells such as T lymphocytes and malignant cells. Koc _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> also reported that of 41 patients, none showed exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease during chemotherapy. We chose NAC because chemotherapy is recommended over endocrine therapy for pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease who warrant neoadjuvant therapy by clinical evidence and guideline. We discontinued infliximab because this patient had maintained a long-term remission of CD and because the cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer could also effectively control CD through its immunosuppressant effect. However, CD symptoms intensified after discontinuation of infliximab even though the patient was receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. We supposed that infliximab was very effective in controlling CD in this patient. Although we should have ruled out the presence of other disease including cytomegalovirus and _Clostridium difficile_ infections, re-administration of infliximab was effective because these symptoms were due to CD relapse. Fecal calprotectin test was not performed because it was not covered by national health insurance in Japan. In cases where CD symptoms flare during chemotherapy, it is not clear whether corticosteroids or anti-TNF should be given 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although CD symptoms remitted after one-time administration of infliximab, a corticosteroid was used during continuation of NAC because combination of chemotherapy and infliximab might cause severe immunosuppression. Interleukin inhibitors were not approved for CD in Japan and might also cause severe immunosuppression in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n【13】This case report highlights the important suggestion that CD may relapse after interruption of infliximab treatment even during treatment with NAC for breast cancer. It is necessary to assess the appropriate management of breast cancer in patients with CD, as well as CD in patients with breast cancer.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Ms Akiko Yuzuriha for her excellent technical assistance.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this report.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent for the publication of the case details was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>H.J. is the guarantor of this report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:44:52", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:45:03", "cost": 10.657}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:45:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:44:50"}

Pleural and ascitic fluid analysis revealed high triglyceride levels, consistent with chylothorax and chylous ascites, respectively. Common etiologies of chylous fluid such as thoracic duct surgical trauma, malignancy and infection were all excluded. Sarcoidosis was confirmed by the presence of non-caseating granulomas on a mediastinal lymph node biopsy.

Pleural fluid gram stain, culture and acid-fast stain results were negative. A follow-up chest CT revealed hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple lung nodules and a dense right posteromedial hilar-pleural lung mass, suspicious for malignancy.

He currently undergoes physical therapy.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Men are half as likely as women to have sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Caucasian men were four times less likely to be affected compared with African American women (40.02 vs 178.47 per 100 000, respectively; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>). Thus, this case of a Caucasian male with sarcoidosis is relatively rare.\n\n【16】Sarcoidosis commonly manifests in the lungs and lymph nodes, yet may affect multiple other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, pleuritic and peritoneal involvement is rare. Pleural effusions were reported in 1.1–3.0% of sarcoidosis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. To date, very few cases of chylous ascites are documented in patients with sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Furthermore, no other cases in available literature describe sarcoidosis with concurrent chylothorax and chylous ascites in a Caucasian male.\n\n【17】The exact pathophysiology of chylothorax and chylous ascites in sarcoidosis is unknown. However, few putative mechanisms have been proposed from related studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>. First, inflammation from sarcoidosis invades the thoracic duct and other smaller lymphatics, resulting in chyle leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Second, bulky lymphadenopathy and intranodal fibrosis obstruct lymphatic flow through the thoracic duct and mesenteric lymphatics. The resulting congestion increases intraluminal pressure, resulting in chyle leakage into the pleural space and peritoneal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Sarcoidosis should be considered when investigating chyle leakage after more common etiologies are ruled out. In this patient, thoracic duct injury was ruled out by the lack of chest trauma and thoracic surgery history. Malignancy was excluded by negative lymph node and pleural biopsies and benign pleural fluid cytology. Tuberculosis was ruled out by negative sputum and pleural fluid cultures, and acid-fast staining. Sarcoidosis was confirmed by non-caseating granulomas in lymph node biopsies, and became the primary suspected cause of chyle leakage.\n\n【19】Conservative medical management with a low-fat diet, octreotide and prednisone initially helped manage this patient’s chylothorax. Long-chain fatty acids get absorbed directly into the lymphatic system via lacteals, forming chyle. However, low-fat diets only contain medium-chain fatty acids that bypass the lymphatic system, reducing chyle generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The somatostatin analog, octreotide, decreases chyle production by reducing mesenteric blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Decreased chyle production causes less chyle leakage from lymphatic channels. Prednisone reduces inflammation by inhibiting cytokine release, reducing lymphadenopathy and improving lymphatic flow)</u>** .\n\n【20】In essence, this case is a novel presentation of sarcoidosis due to uncommon patient demographics and thoracic duct involvement, resulting in chylothorax and chylous ascites. This case illustrates that sarcoidosis may be important in the differential when investigating recurrent chyle leakage. Similar rare cases require individualized treatment plans and referrals to sarcoidosis experts.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine for funding the article processing fee.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FUNDING\n-------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funded by Office of the Dean for Research and Scholarship, College of Osteopathic Medicine, University of New England.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was approved by University of New England Office of Research Integrity (case # 011221-08).</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Verbal and written informed consent were obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Carol Brenner.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 16:02:41", "endTime": "2024/09/09 16:03:28", "cost": 47.439}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-09 00:03:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-09 00:02:41"}

A negative prognostic role of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) has been noticed and is supported by the current case. We describe a male patient who at the age 40 suffered a cardiac arrest and over the following months experienced progressive heart failure, arrhythmias and proximal muscle weakness. Clinical, genetic and serologic testing and repeated imaging- and histopathological investigations resulted in a diagnosis of AMA-associated, necrotizing, inflammatory myositis with cardiac involvement. Besides a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, heart failure and antiarrhythmic drugs the patient received successive immunosuppressants, which improved skeletal muscle strength but not cardiac disease progression. At age 45 he died from end-stage heart failure. Clinicians must be aware of AMA-associated myositis as a cause of unclarified heart disease, even in patients with initially sparse extra-cardiac manifestations. Further knowledge of treatment strategies is highly needed for this disease entity.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Inflammatory myopathy is a heterogeneous disease entity affecting primarily the skeletal muscles.

He had no risk factors for ischemic heart disease. At arrival to the hospital, the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular extra systoles and q-waves in anterior leads . In hospital heart monitoring showed paroxysmal complete heart block. Blood tests revealed elevated troponin-T (262, \\[<14 ng/L\\]), creatine kinase (CK) myocardial band (46,1 \\[<7 μg/L\\]) and total CK (2530 \\[25–400 U/l\\]). Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) disclosed dilatation of left ventricle with ejection fractions (LVEF) of 25–30%, hypofunction of right ventricle and inferoseptal akinesia. Coronary angiography (CAG) showed normal coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed inferoseptal akinesia of the distal part of the myocardium in the left ventricle where late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was found in a subendocardial, almost transmural pattern . A Cardiac-Resynchronization-Therapy-Defibrillator device (CRT-D) was implanted, and anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, statin and heart failure therapy were started. The patient complained of muscle weakness for 2 years. Medical records showed elevated total CK (2000–3000 U/l) tracing back to 2014. Muscle strength testing confirmed proximal weakness of all extremities but no other signs of rheumatic/neurologic disease. The patient was subsequently followed by both cardiologists and neurologists, where progressive muscular weakness, repetitive supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and elevated cardiac/muscle enzymes were registered between 2016 and 2017 . Serological tests for myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) including anti-HMGCR, ANA and genetics for neuromuscular diseases were negative. Whole-body positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography (PET-CT) and pulmonary function tests were normal. Muscle biopsy showed fiber variability and cell necrosis compatible with immune-mediated, necrotizing myopathy. Prednisolone (75 mg/day) was initiated in January 2018 resulting in improved physical performance. In March 2018 methotrexate (MTX) (15–25 mg/week) was added and prednisolone tapered, resulting in continued clinical improvement and stable LVEF of 35%. In March 2019, while treated with MTX (20 mg/week) monotherapy, the patient experienced worsening of muscle weakness and dyspnea. Blood tests showed rising total CK  and X-ray revealed pulmonary congestion. The condition improved transitorily on diuretics and increased MTX (25 mg/week). Six months later, the patient was brought to intensive care in cardiogenic shock due to decompensated severe biventricular failure. He was stabilized by inotropic support, diuretics, amiodarone, upregulation of CRT pace and glucocorticoids. TTE depicted biventricular hypofunction/dilatation (LVEF 10–15%), and a cardiac PET-CT (F-18-FDG/Rb-82) showed nonviable perfusion defect in the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle . A myocardial biopsy revealed mild to moderate hypertrophy and maturing replacement fibrosis with alcian-positive matrix indicating the presence of glycosaminoglycans as seen in early regeneration. Furthermore, endothelial proliferation and a few inflammatory cells were seen in the biopsy, suggesting a recent loss of myocytes . Cyclosporine (200 mg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day) were added to prednisolone (15 mg/day) to attenuate any inflammatory component. Despite stable peripheral muscle function, no convincing cardiac effect appeared. The combination of heart disease and myositis led to test for AMA in April 2020. AMA were present in unmeasurable high titers (>220 \\[<4 kIU/L\\]), supporting a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy related to AMA-associated inflammatory myositis (AMA-IM). In May 2020 rituximab therapy was started but unfortunately no cardiac improvement was achieved. Due to severe chronic renal impairment and ultimately liver failure the patient was not a candidate for heart transplantation. He died in cardiogenic and septic shock in July 2020.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【12】AMA-IM is a rare and sparsely described disease entity occurring independently or along with other autoimmune conditions, especially PBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. Two previous case series found AMA in 0.006 and 11.3%, respectively, of patients with inflammatory myopathy—a variation probably reflecting the limited amount of data in a rare entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Cardiac involvement of AMA-IM is a rather new recognition only described by a few, previous case reports/series within the last decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Little is known about the clinical and histopathological phenotype of AMA-IM. In consistency with our observations, previous cases report polymorph cardiac involvement including arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure as prominent clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>, and muscle biopsies with varying degrees of inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient developed PAF at age 35, which was perceived as a complication to Graves thyrotoxicosis. Retrospectively, PAF could have been an initial symptom of AMA-IM, as it continued despite normalization of thyroid function, and was succeeded by severe conduction abnormalities, rising total CK and decreasing muscle strength over the following years. Previous reports confirm that cardiac manifestations often precede muscle symptoms in AMA-IM, increasing the risk of misdiagnosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In our case, the diagnostic process was further challenged by ambiguous test results as MSAs and ANA screening appeared normal, and neither imaging nor biopsies showed active inflammation. The muscle biopsy showed a necrotizing myopathy, which was not associated to statin as Atorvastatin was prescribed years after the onset of muscle involvement and no anti-HMGCR antibodies were detected. In the endomyocardial biopsy, myocarditis was not directly observed. However, the focal loss of myocytes and replacement with alcian positive material as part of the regenerative process suggests a recent damaging event, which may be myocarditis. The CMRI findings of LGE following cardiac arrest could be due to coronary thromboembolism or an inflammatory process of the myocardium. The former seems unlikely given the normal coronary arteries on the previous CAG. Hence, the initially sparse muscle symptoms and prolonged diagnostic process with step-wise exclusion of genetic -, other rheumatic-, ischemic- and malignant diseases, before AMA testing provided a final diagnosis, caused a treatment delay, which might in part explain the insufficient cardiac responsiveness to immune suppressants in our patient. However, a diminished cardiac versus muscular response to immunosuppressants in AMA-IM has been observed in previous cases, across genders, disease durations and drug types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Taken together, this might point to a need for more aggressive strategies to reverse the cardiac manifestations.\n\n【15】In conclusion, our case supports that cardiac involvement can be a severe complication in AMA-IM and emphasizes the importance of testing for AMA in etiologically unclarified inflammatory myopathies and cardiac failure. The lack of treatment effect on cardiac failure in our and previous cases may indicate that very early and aggressive management of heart involvement is necessary. However, future systematic studies are needed to clarify the optimal treatment strategies for this disease entity.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>P.H.

However, SH is rarely reported after endovascular coiling for ruptured aneurysms.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】The patient was a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco smoking. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute onset of headache and mild right-sided weakness. The patient had neither history of head trauma nor fever before the presentation. Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) of brain revealed extensive SAH. CT cerebral angiography revealed a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCA), 4.5 × 6 mm with neck 2–3 mm, and another internal carotid artery, para-ophthalmic, unruptured aneurysm on the right side. Hunt and Hess’s scale was 3, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14/15. The patient developed generalized tonic–clonic convulsion that was controlled by midazolam and kept on oral levetiracetam.\n\n【10】Endovascular coiling was performed 20 h after the onset of symptoms, and it was an uncomplicated technique. ICU management followed the standard protocol of SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】On the 5th day, GCS decreased to 11/15 and brain CT revealed the same degree of SAH and increased SH, but without any mass effect nor hydrocephalic changes. Transcranial Doppler to exclude cerebral vasospasm was requested but not done at that time due to technical problems.\n\n【12】No improvement was observed in the consciousness level, which deteriorated further. On the 10th day, GCS was 9/15 with worsened right-sided weakness (grade 2). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed right-sided sizable SH exerting mild mass effect and left basal ganglia ischemic focus. Multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) concluded that the patient had delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and significant SH with mild mass effect and recommended no intervention for SH.\n\n【13】At the end of the 2nd week, the consciousness level improved to GCS 11/15 and weakness was grade 3. Surprisingly, imaging revealed progressive right SH and new SH on the left side, but with no mass effect from either hygromas. Another MDM recommended continuing conservative management.\n\n【14】By the end of 1st month, the consciousness level was regained and right-sided weakness improved to grade 4 with mild dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed that SH had decreased. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center (RC) after 1 month of ICU stay.\n\n【15】Imaging after 2 months revealed that SAH was almost cleared, both SHs were still decreasing and a small left basal ganglia infarction. The patient was discharged home from RC without any residual weakness, fully conscious but with mild dysarthria.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】SAH is a serious medical condition with an increased fatality, an incidence of 9 per 100 000 and a fatality rate within 6 months of about 60%. In aneurysmal SAH, the three most important variables related to prognosis are the early neurological state, age and the degree of extravasation on imaging. Consciousness is the most important determinant for outcome after SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In 1932, Dandy described SH as a collection of nonblood fluid in the subdural space that can be encapsulated under a thin membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of SH is still unclear; however, two postulated mechanisms include a tear in the arachnoid membrane causing CSF influx or decreased intracranial pressure leading to passive effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Both external hydrocephalus and SH have unique clinical entities. External hydrocephalus is usually associated with disturbances in CSF flow caused by the imbalance between production and absorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Radiographically, external hydrocephalus and SHs are similar, but ventriculomegaly is the primary distinguishing criterion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Our case was managed by simple endovascular coiling through the femoral approach with the intervention of bleeding left PCA aneurysm (four coils were deployed), and the right one was postponed after complete patient recovery.\n\n【21】The serial imaging of our case never showed any ventriculomegaly during the course. This made it a unique case of SH post-coiling. A previous study reported a case of external hydrocephalus as it was associated with ventriculomegaly, which also complicated the course of coiling for ruptured aneurysm. However, the case remained asymptomatic and the collection resolved spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Subdural collections may be seen after clipping of ruptured aneurysmal SAH but rarely seen after coiling. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting alone is an effective and accepted procedure in post-clipping states. However, patients with subdural effusion that is not accompanied by hydrocephalus do not require subdural peritoneal shunt. When selecting the treatment for subdural effusion, it is important to consider the presence of hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The management strategies for cases of SH following aneurysmal SAH patients are still undefined. Close neurological observation is indicated to follow the progression of any mass effect or conversion into a subdural hematoma.\n\n【24】The management of our case regarding SH was challenging. The deteriorating consciousness level put more ambiguity on the clinical impact of SH due to the incidence of DCI at the same time of increasing size of SH and its mass effect. However, the absence of ventriculomegaly with a meticulous neurological assessment directed us to continue the conservative plan.\n\n【25】The etiology of the SH in the presented case is unknown as there was no history of head trauma at presentation, CSF diversion technique, nor craniotomy, which represent the potential causes for SH after SAH. Whether it is related to CSF flow dynamics post-occurrence of SAH or from a direct effect of coiling (although SH was mainly on the opposite side of bleeding aneurysm) is still to be defined.\n\n【26】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【27】SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONSENT\n-------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed written consent was taken from a first-degree relative.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GUARANTOR\n---------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>W.O.A. and M.E.A.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/09 14:40:53", "endTime": "2024/09/09 14:40:59", "cost": 5.735}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-08 22:36:27", "update_time": "2024-09-08 22:40:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-08 22:40:52"}
