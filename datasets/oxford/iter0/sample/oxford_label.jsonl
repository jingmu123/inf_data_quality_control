This infection usually presents in high prevalence in the rural areas of East Asia and Western pacific islands. It usually presents with fever, chill, myalgia, headache, skin rashes, having pathognomonic and skin lesion i.e. eschar in ~10% cases in Indian subcontinent. It can present with life-threatening complications on occasional. The simultaneous presentation of more than two complications is uncommon, rarely reported in literature. Here we report a case of 37-year-old woman with acute febrile illness, complicated with myocarditis, acute liver failure and leukemoid reaction. She was diagnosed promptly and successfully treated with doxycycline with full recovery of the complications.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ , transmitted to human by bite of trombiculid mite \\[ 1 \\]. The incubation period is usually 6–21 days. The infected patient commonly presents with fever, chill, headache, myalgia, skin rashes, eschar and lymphadenopathy. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of scrub typhus may lead to develop serious complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, meningoencephalitis and rhabdomyolysis, which predominate in second week of untreated infection. Mortality is very variable, ranging from 0% to 70% in untreated patients (median 6%), for unknown reason \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】Here we report a case presenting with a combination of complications like myocarditis, acute liver failure and a rarity-like leukemoid reaction, which was managed by timely diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 37-year-old woman, residing in a village in India, without any comorbidities, presented with fever for 10 days, jaundice for 3 days, disorientation along with chest pain for 2 days prior of admission. Fever was moderate grade, intermittent without any chill and rigor. The jaundice was gradually progressive. The chest pain was dull aching, diffuse and non-radiating, not associated with sweating. The patient disoriented 2 days prior to admission. There was no history of abdominal pain, vomiting, joint pain, skin rashes, oral ulcers, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal bleeding, headache and convulsion. Her menstrual history was normal. She had no history of ischemic heart disease, blood transfusion, intake of alcohol, any chronic drug use (steroid), over the counter or traditional medications and herbs before and after admission.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Photograph showing icterus.\n\n【10】On physical examination, patient was drowsy, Glasgow Coma Scale was 10/15 (E2V4M4), pulse rate was 120/min, blood pressure was 100/70, respiratory rate was 22/min, axillary temperature was 102°F and there were no rashes on skin. The patient was icteric ( Figure 1 ) and had mild pallor. There was diffuse tenderness over right hypochondrium on abdominal examination. She had bilateral extensor planter. S <sub>3 </sub> gallop was found on cardiovascular examination. Considering these clinical scenario infections, which are commonly diagnosed in India, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis and scrub typhus were thought of but autoimmune diseases were also kept in mind.\n\n【11】Complete hemogram revealed anemia (hemoglobin 9.2 g%), marked leukocytosis (90 400/cmm), thrombocytopenia (platelet 1 lac/cmm) and left shift on peripheral blood smear (neutrophils and band forms 70%, myelocytes 2%, metamyelocytes 10%, monocytes 2%, eosinophils 2%). She had normal serum electrolytes (serum Na+ 138 mEq/l, K+ 3.8 mEq/l) and renal functions (Ur 22 mg/dl, Cr 0.7 mg/dl). There was conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 7.6 mg/dl, direct/indirect 5.6 mg/dl/2 mg/dl), marked transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] 3552 U/l, alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] 4055 U/l) with normal serum albumin and globulin level on liver function test, which suggested acute hepatitis. There was coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT, 54.2 s) international normalized ratio (INR, 6.45) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, 34.2 s). Serum ammonia was 94.4 mcg/dl, which suggested of hepatic encephalopathy. She had lactate dehydrogenase (1032 U/l), C-reactive protein (32.2 mg/dl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm first 1 h) and procalcitonin was negative (0.4 ng/ml). Serum triglyceride was 176 mg/dl. Ultrasonography of abdomen showed increased liver echogenicity. Her blood and urine were sterile. Autoimmune workup like anti-nuclear antibody was negative.\n\n【12】She had towering liver enzymes with acute liver failure but serologically negative for hepatotropic virus (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus, hepatitis A virus). Serology for IgM dengue/IgM leptospira was negative. No malarial parasites were found on peripheral blood smear; Malaria Parasite Dual Antigen (MPDA) was also negative. But she had positive IgM for scrub typhus detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of brain was normal; cerebrospinal fluid study was done to rule out any central nervous system (CNS) infection, but it was normal.\n\n【13】Her drowsiness was explained by hepatic encephalopathy after ruled out all possible metabolic and septic causes of encephalopathy, CNS infection and vascular events.\n\n【14】For chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) was done, showing ST-depression on lateral leads predominantly (V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6, </sub> lead 1, Augmented Vector Left (aVL)) ( Figure 2 ) with elevated Troponin-T and Creatine Phosphokinase - MB (CPK-MB); there was global hypokinesia of left ventricle with ejection fraction 45% on transthoracic echocardiography, which suggested of myocarditis noninvasively supported by history of non-ischemic chest pain and normalization of ST-T changes, cardiac enzymes and echocardiographic findings later, after institution of disease directed treatment. Because of coagulopathy, with PT (54.2 s) INR (6.45) and aPTT (34.2 s), coronary angiography was not done.\n\n【15】Figure 2\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】ECG showing ST depression on lead I, aVL, V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6 </sub> .\n\n【18】For leukocytosis, to rule out myeloproliferative disorders, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done, which showed reactive marrow with myeloid: erythroid (M:E): 3:1 and no abnormal and hemophagocytic cells.\n\n【19】For reactive marrow and leukocytosis, we did leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score, it came out 110, which is high, so leukemoid reaction was confirmed. The patient was hemodynamically stable with ho history of hypotension; so this leukemoid reaction was not explained by hepatic necrosis.\n\n【20】Initially, the patient was treated symptomatically for acute liver failure and myocarditis. She was put on intravenous doxycycline for 14 days after positive scrub typhus report. The patient was improved gradually and became asymptomatic with normalization of liver enzymes (ALT 34 U/l and AST 28 U/l), thin-layer chromatography was 9800/cmm, cardiac enzymes (CPK-MB and troponin T) and ST-T changes on ECG on discharge and asked to take rest another few days, avoid strenuous activities and slowly increase exercise level.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Elevation of liver enzymes is common in scrub typhus but acute liver failure is rarely reported in literature \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【23】Presentation of chest pain with tachycardia and S <sub>3 </sub> gallop suggested myocarditis, which was confirmed by ECG findings (ST depression, T inversion) and elevated troponin T and CPK-MB. Myocarditis rarely reported \\[ 4 \\] and postulated to be caused by localized infection in endothelial cells of heart and cardiac myocytes \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【24】Leukemoid reaction which, is very unusual following scrub typhus, can be explained as physiological response to overwhelming infection, which releases stimulatory molecules like growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT) ligand), adhesion molecules (CD11b/CD18) and various cytokines (interleukin-1, 3, 6, 8, tumour necrosis factor) \\[ 3 \\]. It often mimics hematological malignancy and could be differentiated by elevated LAP score \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In a tropical country like India, scrub typhus serology should be done in acute febrile patient presenting with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis. Scrub typhus infection has an excellent therapeutic response to inexpensive antibiotic doxycycline within 5 days of therapy \\[ 8 \\]. Early therapeutic intervention with doxycycline should be intensified in endemic countries.\n\n【25】Scrub typhus has emerged as a common etiology of febrile illness in Southeast Asian countries. It is underrecognized infection, which may present with serious complications like myocarditis and acute liver failure. Leukemoid reaction may be seen in scrub typhus like other triggering infections. In patients with acute febrile illness with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis, scrub typhus should be ruled out in all cases. Timely diagnosis of disease and therapy with doxycycline/or azithromycin leads to excellent prognosis.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】We would like to mention our gratitude to Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh, Head of Department, Department of Internal Medicine, IPGMER and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】None required.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

These swellings appeared spontaneously or after trivial injury and either used to resolve spontaneously or they ossified into mature bone. These flares of heterotopic ossification resulted in gradual restriction of movements of neck, trunk, shoulder, elbow, hip and knee joints. There was associated congenital hallux valgus bilaterally (Fig. 1 a). There was no history of similar illness in her family. The radiographs of the girl showed certain characteristic features of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The cervical skiagram showed characteristic anomalies of the cervical spine in form of large posterior elements and fusion of the facet joints between C2 and C7 **(** Fig. 1 b **)** \\[ 1 \\]. A CT scan of dorso-lumbar spine showed a peculiar ‘Y-shaped’ soft tissue ossification extending from the inferior angle of bilateral scapulae to the midline soft tissue of posterior back (lattisimus dorsi muscles and thoracolumbar fascia). It also demonstrated dorso-lumbar scoliosis and fusion of posterior elements of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 1 c).\n\n【2】Figure 1:\n\n【3】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【4】( **a** ) Characteristic malformed great toe and hallux valgus.

Classic FOP is caused by a recurrent activating mutation (617G>A; R206H) in the gene ACVR1/ALK2 encoding Activin A receptor type I/Activin-like kinase 2, a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor \\[ 2 \\]. This genetic defect which leads to the formation of a heterotopic skeleton involves normal skeletal morphogenesis at heterotopic sites \\[ 3 \\]. During the first decade of life, sporadic episodes of painful soft tissue swellings (flare-ups) occur which are often precipitated by trivial injury. These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone causing restriction of movements of various joints. The flares may partially respond to a short course of steroids, but overall prognosis is reduced with median lifespan of 40 years. Most patients die of complications of thoracic insufficiency syndrome \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【7】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【8】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Stable formation of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to particular onconeural antigens occurs in the majority of cases, whereas persistent coexistence of antibodies specific for multiple onconeural antigens is a relatively rare phenomenon of certain malignant tumors like small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We here describe onconeural antigen spreading in a 70-year-old Caucasian male with PND due to SCLC. Onconeural antigen spreading may be promoted by two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms: (i) a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself and (ii) a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens. This illustrates a potential dissociation between peripheral anti-tumoral immunity and central anti-neural immunity during the course of PND.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cellular and humoral immunity towards distinct onconeural antigens is the hallmark of PNDs \\[ 1 \\].

However, onconeural antigen spreading, i.e. the dynamic appearance and disappearance of distinct onconeural antibodies during the course of PNDs in individual patients has not yet been described.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a long history of smoking and surgically treated urothelium carcinoma 2 years ago, presented 08/2013 with radicular neuralgia and hypesthesia of the legs, disturbed fine motor skills of the hands and extinction of knee and ankle jerks on both sides, accompanied by abnormal posture and ataxic gait. Nerve conduction studies revealed severe demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy fulfilling the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Initial MRI of the brain and entire spinal cord showed moderate contrast enhancement in fibers of the cauda equine an radices only (not shown). Cerebral (as part of a whole-body) FDG-PET/CT was normal (Fig. 1 A). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation (cell count of 0/μl; protein 1003 mg/l; albumin ratio 18.4 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ) and presence of elevated fractions of activated HLADR <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD138 <sup>+ </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> plasma cells (Fig. 1 B) without intrathecal Ig-synthesis or oligoclonal bands (type 1 pattern). The detection of serum onconeural anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies together with the long history of smoking (Fig. 1 A) prompted a detailed tumor search especially for SCLC. Chest-CT showed atelectasis of the middle pulmonary lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, whole-body FDG-PET/CT and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy of suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes revealed no malignancy. Sonography of abdomen and pelvis together with detailed urological examination with cystourethroscopy also yielded no evidence for a cancer relapse.\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Onconeural antigen spreading in paraneoplastic neurological disease due to small cell lung cancer occurs during continued inflammation.

Neuropsychological assessment showed severe memory impairment and executive dysfunction (Fig. 1 B). Cerebral MRI exhibited increased T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensities without contrast-enhancement, and cerebral FDG-PET/CT demonstrated glucose hypermetabolism of the right more than left temporomesial brain region (Fig. 1 A). Interictal EEG showed right- more than left-sided temporal slowing in the theta-delta band together with sharp waves and sharp-slow-waves. CSF analysis revealed normal cells counts (3/μl) with normal protein (481 mg/l) and no disruption of the blood/CSF barrier (albumin ratio 5.8 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ), but intrathecal IgG synthesis (55%) and ≥3 CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (type 3 pattern) together with persistently elevated fractions of activated HLADR <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, and CD138 <sup>+ </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> plasma cells (Fig. 1 B) \\[ 4 \\]. In addition to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1, anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies became detectable in serum and CSF (Fig. 1 A). These findings established paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis in addition to demyelinating and axonal polyradiculoneuropathy and illustrate a spread of the paraneoplastic immune response from the peripheral to the central nervous system. Repeated searches for malignancy using FDG-PET/-CT, chest-CT, abdominal sonography, oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Hence, long-term immunosuppressive treatment was initiated using cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every 4–6 weeks) together with anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (starting with 2 × 500 mg/day).\n\n【10】Clinical and paraclinical follow-up examinations during 22 months of immunosuppressive and anticonvulsive treatment after initial amelioration revealed deteriorating memory and executive functions (Fig. 1 B) together with progressive sensory and also cerebellar ataxia and continued temporal lobe seizures prompting enhanced anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (up to 2 × 1000 mg/day). MRI showed persistent hyperintense T2/FLAIR signals of the right more than left mesial temporal lobe without contrast-enhancement together with progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1 A). FDG-PET/CT illustrated persistent right temporomesial hypermetabolism (Fig. 1 A). Another FDG-PET/CT scan of the whole body did not provide evidence of cancer.\n\n【11】Remarkably, throughout the disease course antigen spreading of the humoral paraneoplastic immune response could be observed. Anti-Hu, anti-SOX1, and anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies persisted whereas anti-Yo IgG antibodies switched to anti-CV2 IgG antibodies in both serum and CSF (Fig. 1 A). In 01/2016, ~30 months after disease onset and initial detection of onconeural IgG antibodies, SCLC was confirmed from another biopsy of the previously suspicious middle pulmonary lobe, which at that point showed distinct tracer-enrichment upon the fifth FDG-PET/CT scan. Additional staging yielded limited disease, and the patient received combined radio-chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Our case represents a typical PND with associated onconeual antibodies which appears a few years ahead of the related malignancy \\[ 5 \\]. Multiple coexisting onconeural antibodies are rare, however such clusters of antibodies occur more frequently than previously assumed \\[ 2 \\]. Nevertheless, a dynamic switch between distinct onconeural antibody entities during the course of individual PND has not been reported thus far.\n\n【14】In that regard, two pathophysiological scenarios explaining such antigen spreading seem conceivable: First, (mainly peripheral) antigen spreading may be promoted by a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself \\[ 6 \\]. This would explain the appearance of anti-Zic4 and anti-CV2 IgG antibodies (at higher concentrations in serum compared to CSF) adding to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies which are all frequently associated with PNDs and typical for SCLC \\[ 7 \\]. Second, (mainly central) antigen-spreading may be promoted by a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens. This may be enhanced by persistent epileptic activity of the affected brain tissue and (transient) spread of the intrathecal immune response to other sites of the brain and spinal cord i.e. from the limbic system to the cerebellum in this case. This would explain the transient detection of anti-Yo IgG antibodies (at higher concentrations in CSF compared to serum), that are usually not associated with SCLC and mainly expressed by cerebellar Purkinje neurons \\[ 1 , 5 , 7 \\].\n\n【15】Moreover, a contribution of immunotherapies like cyclophosphamide to the appearance of novel onconeural antibodies during the treatment course due to cytotoxic effects especially on tumor cells (less so on neurons) cannot be excluded.\n\n【16】This illustrates a potential dissociation between peripheral anti-tumoral immunity and central anti-neural immunity during the course of PND which should to be considered for the choice of treatment strategies.\n\n【17】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【18】We thank the patient and his family for participation in this study.

A 59-year-old man who was diagnosed with carcinoma of unknown primary with a subgroup of lung squamous cell carcinoma had bronchoesophageal fistula formation after three cycles of nivolumab as the fourth line treatment. Before the initiation of nivolumab, he had received two esophageal stents and an angiogenesis inhibitor. These are known risk factors for fistula formation. This is a rare case showing that nivolumab monotherapy might induce bronchoesophageal fistulae. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the factors related to fistula formation when using ICIs.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) target immune checkpoints that suppress the activity of immune cells. There are several types of immune checkpoints, including the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein. ICIs are widely used in both monotherapy and combination chemotherapy for many types of cancer \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Nivolumab, which targets PD-1, is one of the most popular ICIs, and the number of adapted malignant diseases for nivolumab is increasing. It has been most recently used in patients with advanced esophageal cancers \\[ 3 \\]. Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) is a malignant tumor that is histologically diagnosed as a metastatic lesion, but its primary lesion is unknown despite a full-body examination \\[ 4 \\]. In the Special Clinical Science Symposium of ASCO 2020, a phase II trial performed by Kinki University showed that nivolumab was effective in the management of CUP. Clinicians, particularly medical oncologists, should have better knowledge regarding the use of ICIs. Bronchoesophageal fistula formation is a severe complication of esophageal or lung cancer, especially following radiation therapy. Although ICIs are associated with a variety of adverse events, the relationship between bronchoesophageal fistula formation and ICIs is unknown.\n\n【4】**Figure 1**\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】The patient’s treatment courses with all events including endoscopic examination of the patient’s esophagus.

( **B** ) Self-expanding uncovered metal stent and tumor growth within the stent can be identified. ( **C** ) A close-up picture of the tumor in which biopsy was performed. ( **D** ) Histological examination of the tumor showed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 59-year-old man who experienced difficulty in swallowing for 4 months underwent upper endoscopy. On examination, no change was observed in the mucosal surface of the esophagus, but we found stricture associated with compression from the outside. Subsequently, he underwent positron emission tomography–computed tomography (CT), and multiple lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular fossa, mediastinal, intraperitoneal and right inguinal nodes, showed <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation. Because the mediastinal lymph node metastasis was pressing on his esophagus, he underwent esophageal self-expanding uncovered metal stent insertion, and his symptoms improved. A mediastinal lymph node (#7) biopsy conducted by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration revealed squamous cell carcinoma. However, a whole-body examination could not detect the primary lesion, and he was diagnosed with postoperative recurrence of CUP. Since lung cancer has more treatment options than other cancers, we considered his CUP as a subtype of lung cancer. Figure 1A details his treatment course with some events. Chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; Days 1, 8 and 15 in a 4-week cycle) and carboplatin (target area under the curve, 6; Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) was initiated as first-line treatment. Ramucirumab (10 mg/kg, Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) and docetaxel (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , Day 1 in a 3-week cycle) were administered as second-line treatment. The patient underwent biopsy of the tumor within the esophageal stent, and the tumor was histologically determined as squamous cell carcinoma ( Fig. 1B–D ). Thereafter, the patient was initiated on third-line treatment with S-1 (100 mg/day, Days 1–28 in a 6-week cycle). After one cycle of S-1, the tumor at the lower edge of the esophageal stent grew and the patient often vomited because of obstruction. He underwent esophageal self-expanding covered metal stent insertion at the site of obstruction and could resume eating. Three weeks after stenting, he received nivolumab as fourth-line treatment. After three cycles of nivolumab, he had a high fever and productive cough with purulent sputum. A chest CT showed consolidation along the right bronchus that demonstrated pneumonia and a fistula at the truncus intermedius ( Fig. 2 ). He then underwent bronchoscopy, where we found three bronchoesophageal fistulae ( Fig. 3 ). Furthermore, we placed a third esophageal covered stent to seal the tracheoesophageal communication after the pneumonia improved. However, his left vocal cord got paralyzed due to the enlargement of the left cervical lymph node metastasis, which was found on bronchoscopy examination. Although he underwent dysphagia rehabilitation, he developed aspiration pneumonia. He stopped food intake by his mouth, and underwent gastrostomy. Subsequently, his general condition worsened, and he died from suffocation because of clogging with sputum.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Findings on chest CT.

This therapeutic complication is serious and can be fatal. Recently, it was reported that durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy might cause bronchomediastinal fistulae in stage III non-small cell lung cancer \\[ 5 \\]. However, there are few reports on the relationship between ICIs and fistula formation. Acral vascular necrosis, which indicates small vessel vasculitis and leads to ischemia, was introduced as an immune-related adverse event of ICIs \\[ 6 \\]. In this case, given that nivolumab caused vasculitis in the area around the stent, vasculitis might have led to necrosis and fistula formation. Furthermore, in our case, besides nivolumab, two other factors, including the esophageal stent and ramucirumab may have been related to the fistulae. It has been reported that placement of an esophageal stent induces tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration \\[ 7 \\]. Since our patient had a second esophageal stent placement before fistula formation, some part of the tissue around the stent may have become necrotic because of the process of inflammation. Furthermore, there are two different reports similar to our case. One report showed that one cycle of pembrolizumab caused tracheoesophageal fistula formation in a patient with squamous cell lung cancer and bronchial stent in the left bronchus \\[ 8 \\]. Another study showed that one cycle of pembrolizumab caused esophagobronchial perforations after the placement of an esophageal self-expanding metallic stent in a patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma \\[ 9 \\]. Based on the above considerations, we might be able to explain the process of fistula formation associated with ICIs ( Fig 4 ). Antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, are often used in combination chemotherapy for many types of cancers, and there are some reports about fistula formation and delay in wound healing associated with the use of these drugs \\[ 10 \\]. In this case, 156 days had passed since the last administration of ramucirumab to the development of bronchoesophageal fistula. Because the half-life of ramucirumab is reported to be ~8 days, ramucirumab is unlikely to be a factor in fistula formation. Thus, administration of ICIs might have triggered fistula formation in this patient. Since there are only a few cases of ICIs and fistulas, the attending physician should check whether the patients have a stent before administration of ICIs.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【21】We thank the patient and his family for providing informed consent for the processing of his personal data for this publication.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】S.Y. received honoraria from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and obtained research funding from Eisai Co., Ltd, Noile-Immune Biotech Inc. and obtained subsidies or donations from Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, EliLilly Japan K.K.

Dysfunction of TIVAP is not uncommon in clinical practice in cases of several etiologies. Herein, we report a rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to a catheter that migrated into the pleural space. Case presentation: We present a case of a 70-year-old man of TIVAP dysfunction due to a rare catheter extra-vascular migration into the pleural space, diagnosed by computed tomography. We decided on observation without further utilization of the TIVAP and a shift to oral chemotherapy, after a discussion with patient and his primary care oncologist. Conclusion: Our case highlighted the importance of proper evaluation of TIVAP catheter location before its usage or replacement.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used as a reliable route for chemotherapy, transfusions or parenteral nutrition support. Dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of TIVAP. The etiologies described in the literature include venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter obstruction, catheter disruption or dislocation \\[ 1 \\]. Herein, we report the rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to catheter migration into the pleural space.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man presented to the vascular surgical outpatient clinic with TIVAP dysfunction. He received TIVAP (8-Fr Polysite silicone catheter in 2018, Perouse Medical, Ivry-Le-Temple, France.) implantation more than 3 years ago. He had received monthly 80 mg intravenous docetaxel treatment for left lung squamous cell carcinoma after the TIVAP implantation. As patient’s statement, he has dry cough before diagnosed of lung squamous cell carcinoma and persistent during the course of chemotherapy. Obstruction of the device occurred during blood aspiration though a smooth intravenous push was reported by nursing staff in the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea had developed hours after infusion of chemotherapeutic agents in the past 6 months. On examination, the port was well fixed, with a fair depth of puncture. Migration of the catheter tip was found by plain film check-up ( Fig. 1 , arrowhead), compared with the image obtained 6 months ago. Chest computed tomography revealed that the catheter migrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space ( Fig. 2 , arrowhead). Catheter removal with SVC repair via sternotomy or endovascular stent graft coverage with adequate pericardial drainage was advised, but the patient chose conservative treatment for the migrated device. Oral Vinorelbine 100 mg twice per month was initiated after a discussion with the primary care oncologist. This helped keep the patient in asymptomatic and tumor recurrence-free status during the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Migration of the catheter tip (arrowhead).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】The catheter migrated through the SVC into the pleural space (arrowhead).\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used for chemotherapy, transfusions and parenteral nutrition. The incidence of TIVAP malfunction ranges from 0.67 to 3.7% \\[ 2–6 \\]. Etiology includes intra-catheter thrombosis or precipitation, fibrin sheath formation or venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter kinking, pinch-off syndrome and catheter migration \\[ 7 \\]. The incidence of spontaneous catheter migration ranges from 0.4 to 2% based on a review of the available literature \\[ 1 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]. In this case, the migrated catheter penetrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space, which is a rare clinical situation.\n\n【14】We postulate that the mechanism of catheter migration may be related to an elevated intra-thoracic cavity due to cough, which is especially frequent in patients with lung cancer, as described by Wu _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\]. Shallow catheter tip location, which is defined as a catheter tip located above the lower third of SVC, and lung cancer were assumed to be risk factors for catheter migration \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Here, the migrated catheter tip was directed towards the post-chemotherapy fibrotic SVC wall, with a combination of radial force caused by the angulating catheter itself, and the kinetic movement of the heartbeat resulting in penetration of the vessel wall into pleural space.\n\n【15】Chou _et al_ . reported a case of innominate vein penetration into the pleural space by a left-sided silicone TIVAP catheter 4 months after implantation \\[ 10 \\]. The patient had left-side massive pleural effusion after fluid infusion via TIVAP. In our patient, the catheter migrated into the right pleural space via the pericardial space, as shown by CT, which would explain his discomfort after chemotherapy. Over-the-wire catheter exchange or direct catheter removal are the treatment choice for the obstructed TIVAP. However, any intervention affecting the dysfunctional catheter, including removal or exchange may lead to possible lethal hemothorax or hemopericardium without proper closure of the chronic tract, which had been reported in previous reports \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. Leaving the TIVAP without further utilization did not cause any adverse effect; therefore, this option was also provided. After understanding the treatment options, their risks and benefits, and considering his preferences, goals and beliefs, he did not want to undergo more invasive interventions, due to his old age and advanced cancer status. This decision was made according to the current shared decision making procedure.\n\n【16】In conclusion, extra-vascular migration of the catheter is a rare but important etiology of TIVAP malfunction. Physicians and surgeons should be aware of this risk when inserting a TIVAP as well as the way to prevent it, i.e. catheter tip check before usage or replacement.\n\n【17】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【18】The authors thank the primary care physician Dr Chin-Teng Yu for detailed case information sharing and the department chief Dr Sheng-Yueh Yu for general support.

GBS has rarely been described after meningitis. This case is unique in that our findings show that GBS may be observed after meningococcal meningitis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated condition that is now the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis, since the elimination of poliomyelitis \\[ 1 \\]. We present a case of GBS as a rare complication of meningococcal meningitis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with a 1-day history of vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and back pain on the background of 2 days of coryzal symptoms. The patient was otherwise well with no significant medical history. The patient was married with an adult daughter. He was a manager of a car body repair business. He was a non-smoker and drank no more than one standard measure of alcohol in the form of beer per day. The patient had no contact with schools or college dormitories; did not have a complement deficiency; had not been given complement inhibitors eculizumab or rovelizumab; did not have hyposplenism, sickle cell disease or HIV infections and had not travelled to high risk areas like sub-Saharan Africa. He had no contract with a person infected with meningococcal disease.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was febrile, tachycardic and given empirical intravenous antibiotics, whereas in the Emergency Department his Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to 7/15 and he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit with the provisional diagnosis of meningitis.\n\n【7】He had a raised white cell count of 25.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L with disseminated intravascular coagulation (platelet count of 39.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and a raised INR at 1.6). A lumbar puncture could not be performed because of the coagulopathy; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, cell counts, glucose, cytology, culture and microscopy were unable to be measured. Blood cultures grew _Neisseria meningitidis_ , sensitive to rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone but was resistant to penicillin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/nucleic acid detection test (NAT) identified the organism as serotype _W N. meningitidis_ . He was put on IV ceftriaxone.\n\n【8】In the Emergency Department he had spontaneous movement of all four limbs. He had marked nuchal rigidity without skin rash. His second neurological assessment in the intensive care unit (ICU) revealed normal lower limb tone with decreased lower limb reflexes. On Day 1 of the admission, whilst intubated, the patient had spontaneous movement of the upper limbs but no movement of the lower limb. On Day 2 he was not responding by movement to painful stimuli of the lower limbs. This continued until he was extubated on Day 6. A formal neurological examination on Day 6 revealed areflexia, hypotonia and power of 0/5 in both lower limbs. Upper limb neurology was intact. The neurology team was consulted, and a formal assessment revealed hypotonia, areflexia and no movement of both lower limbs, with intact neurology in the upper limbs. The patient was suspected to have developed GBS after the _N. meningitidis_ infection and was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Nerve conduction studies revealed a severe predominant motor polyneuropathy with proximal nerve involvement. Active denervation was not identified in any muscle sampled. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine revealed T2 signal hyperintensity and enhancement of the cauda equina consistent with GBS ( Fig. 1 ). The spinal cord was normal. He was never given steroids. During his admission he developed minimal adduction and internal rotation of both lower limbs but remained areflexic. He was transferred to the neurosurgical service due to the development of ventriculitis for which he required an external ventricular drain. CSF from the drain confirmed serotype _W N. meningitidis_ on PCR/NAT. Modified Rankin Scale on transfer to the State Neurosurgical Service was 5, indicating severe disability.\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Spinal cord showing T2 signal hyperintensity and enhancement of the cauda equina consistent with GBS.\n\n【12】The reason as to why this previously healthy man should have developed meningococcaemia is unknown as he had no immunodeficiency, a normal spleen, normal immunoglobulins and lymphocyte numbers, including T and B cells.\n\n【13】The patient was discharged home after having spent 21 weeks in hospital. Upon review, he was able to shave himself and make tea and coffee. He could walk backwards 15 m with the gutter frame. His balance was improving. He could get up and out of the chair without assistance. He could move in and out of a motor vehicle. He could dress himself and brush his teeth. He was able to self-catheterize his urinary bladder four times per day. He did a manual evacuation of his bowels every couple of days. He had no feeling in the perianal region or the scrotum or the penis. He had pain in his hamstring muscles. He had pain from heel to toes, left greater than the right, like an electrocution. He could move his legs and lie down, and elevate them from the bed. He had bilateral extracranial hearing aids. He was able to crawl on his hands and knees. He had leg braces to support him when necessary. He had parasthaesias on the dorsum and balls of his feet. His toes were clawing. His hands were fully functional. His most recent weight was 78.3 kg—he was 76 kg when he left hospital. He could stand barefooted but not walk. He could balance and stand at a bench. He scored 3 on the Modified Rankin Scale, which is consistent with moderate disability. He has improved after 2 years since diagnosis to no significant disability—Modified Rankin Scale = 1.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】GBS is an immune-mediated condition characterized by rapid onset of paralysis.\n\n【16】GBS is generally triggered by an antecedent upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. Various pathogens such as _Campylobacter jejuni_ , _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr_ virus and _Varicella zoster_ virus have been associated with GBS \\[ 2 \\]. A novel finding raised by our patient is the presentation of GBS after a _N. meningitidis_ infection. Blood cultures and CSF PCR both identified _N. meningitidis_ as the preceding pathogen. Furthermore, PCR also excluded other simultaneous infections, indicating that the _N. meningitidis_ infection was the likely trigger to the patient’s subsequent GBS.\n\n【17】_N. meningitidis_ is a well-known cause of meningitis and sepsis which may lead to permanent neurological deficits; however, it has not been described as a trigger for GBS. The presumed mechanism for GBS after a _N. meningitidis_ infection is molecular mimicry as described for _C. jejuni_ \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【18】GBS has been suggested as a possible diagnosis in two previous patients with meningococcaemia \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】GBS has been described extensively in the literature after a variety of infectious and inflammatory conditions—it has rarely been described after meningitis. Previous cases have described paralysis after meningitis; however, these cases had myelitis. Our patient is unique as he shows that GBS may be observed after meningitis and we report this patient to raise awareness of this complication amongst clinicians. Furthermore, although multiple bacterial and viral pathogens have been implicated in causing GBS, _N. meningitidis_ has not been previously identified as a trigger for GBS. Further cases are necessary to identify the mechanism by which GBS develops after a _N. meningitidis_ infection.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【22】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【23】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【24】This work was supported by Neurodegenerative Disorders Research Pty Ltd.\n\n【25】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【26】Not applicable.\n\n【27】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【28】The patient provided written informed consent for his case to be published.\n\n【29】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【30】Professor Peter K Panegyres.\n\n【31】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【32】P.K.P. diagnosed and treated the patient, and edited the manuscript to its final form; D.K. examined the patient and prepared the draft manuscript.\n\n【33】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【34】We thank patient MB and wife PB for participating in this research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Secretory pheochromocytomas have been previously implicated in cases of TS (PTS), however, often present atypically, are associated with reoccurrence, and have higher rates of complications. We describe the case of a 70-year-old female who presented central chest pain, hypotension and electrocardiogram changes on a background of a 6-month prior episode of resolved Takotsubo’s with unknown cause. After progressing to cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure, computerized tomography coronary aortogram revealed an incidental adrenal mass, later proven to be a secretory pheochromocytoma on biochemistry and subsequent histology. PTS has been associated with recurrence and rarely presents as cardiogenic shock. This case highlights the complexity of TS presentations and complications and the diagnostic delays that may occur in PTS.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takotsubo’s syndrome (TS) is an acute cardiomyopathy, which causes transient circumferential left ventricular wall motion abnormality in the context of intense physical or emotional stress, in absence of coronary artery compromise on angiography or plaque rupture \\[ 1–3 \\]. The name Takotsubo refers to a Japanese octopus trap, which the apical ballooning of the left ventricle in systole bears resemblance to in TS. TS is considerably more common in older (mean \\[±SD\\] 66.8 ± 13.0 years) women (9:1), occurs secondary to a myriad of conditions including intracranial insults (e.g. subarachnoid haemorrhage, head injury, stroke, epilepsy and electroconvulsive therapy), psychiatric conditions (e.g. anxiety and depression) or states of catecholamine excess \\[ 3 \\]. Circulating catecholamines and the ‘surge effect’ \\[ 4 \\] have been proposed to induce damage through either microvascular dysfunction, which results in myocardial stunning \\[ 5 \\] or, through direct toxicity on myocardial cells \\[ 6 \\]. Pheochromocytoma—an adrenal tumour which can be secretory—is one such cause of catecholamenia. Symptoms from of pheochromocytoma-induced TS (PTS) are frequently more atypical than non-pheochromocytoma-induced TS, presenting a diagnostic challenge, and with greater risk of complications and recurrence \\[ 3 , 7 , 8 \\]. Furthermore, aside from a recently published meta-analysis \\[ 8 \\], existing data are limited, consisting of case reports and series. Here, we present the case of an otherwise well, healthy female with two presentations of Takotsubo’s, escalating in severity, before definitive treatment of her adrenal tumour.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old female presented to her local hospital with nausea, central chest pain, palpitations, vomiting and shortness of breath. She was found to be hypotensive, with a moderate troponin rise (150 ng/l) and S–T elevation on electrocardiogram (leads V1–V4). She was transferred to a private regional hospital coronary care unit (CCU) where cardiac investigations including transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and angiogram were found to be normal. She reported no recent increase in stress, and her past medical history was significant for previous hemithyroidectomy (2011, currently euthyroid) and osteoarthritis, with no history of diabetes, hypertension or smoking, and no family history of catecholamine-secreting tumours. Notably, she had presented 6-month earlier to her local hospital with an episode of hypotension, chest pain and TTE findings consisting of an ejection fraction of 30%, hypokinetic left ventricle (LV), poorly contracting right ventricle (RV) with dilatation and mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Consistent with TS, symptoms and TTE findings had resolved within 3 months on repeat TTE with commencement of aspirin 100 mg in the morning, simvastatin 20 mg and rampiril 1.25 mg in the evening.\n\n【6】Twenty-four hours after commencing bisoprolol 12.5 mg BD in CCU, she developed cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management. She was profoundly bradycardic (40 bpm), with a troponin of 7327 ng/l, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ~18–23% with severe regional wall motion abnormalities (severe akinesis in all segments except the base), mildly dilated right ventricle with wall motion abnormality ( Fig. 1 ) and evidence of end organ dysfunction (acute kidney injury and ischaemic hepatitis). She reported no pain however was diaphoretic with ongoing nausea. Milrinone and dobutamine infusions were commenced, resulting in tachycardia up to 200 bpm with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate (RVR), which was chemically reverted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, and required no further inotropic support. Computerized tomography (CT) angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease and notably her CT aortogram revealed no aortic dissection but an incidental finding of a 5.8 × 4.8 × 5.5 heterogenous mass right-sided adrenal mass.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Apical 4 chamber view of left ventricular and right ventricular views shows severe segmental systolic dysfunction. Estimated LVEF was 20% by Simpson’s biplane method.\n\n【10】Endocrinology was consulted: biochemistry showed an elevated serum cortisol on dexamethasone suppression test (>1650 nmol/l; normal range < 50 nmol/l), and elevated early morning cortisol (>1649 nmol/l), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 15.7H pmol/l), renin (100 mIU/l) and aldosterone (835 pmol/l). Plasma metanephrines (normetadrenaline 20 000 pmol/l, normal range 130–1600; Metadrenaline 36 000 pmol/l, normal range 30–540) and 3 Methoxy Tyramine (682 pmol/l, normal range < 120) were also significantly elevated, suspicious for a secretory pheochromocytoma. She was commenced on alpha and beta blockade therapy (prazocin 2.5 mg/metoprolol 12.5 mg, once daily) and the upper gastrointestinal surgical team was consulted for elective resection after successful uptitration of her alpha blocker by cardiology/endocrinology teams. She was consented and proceeded for elective resection of her adrenal mass in the following 6 weeks when recovered, with pre-operative review in the high-risk anaesthetics clinic and planned post-operative transfer to ICU. Histology was positive for an organ-confined pheochromocytoma with no vascular/capsular invasion ( Figs 2 and 3 ), consistent with T1NX on 8th Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) parameters \\[ 9 \\]. She recovered well post-operatively under the care of the cardiology/endocrinology teams and was discharged one week later. Repeated echocardiogram at follow-up demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function at 3 months.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Right adrenalectomy specimen, capsule intact, measuring 60 × 25 × 25 mm, weight 84.1 g.

However, robust data on patients with TS secondary to pheochromocytoma is lacking. Larger datasets, such as the International Takotsubo Registry, (consisting of 9 countries and 1750 patients), excludes those with pheochromocytoma \\[ 3 \\]. Although there have been over 80 published case reports of pheochromocytoma-induced TS (PTS; \\[ 7 \\]), this is likely underreported, with a number erroneously reported as pheochromocytoma-induced angina or myocardial infarction, rather than TS per se \\[ 10 \\]. We highlight three keyways PTS differs from TS—tendency to recurrence, symptom profile and complications. These differences are reflected in this case, and we hope may represent both diagnostic clues and considerations for other clinicians.\n\n【19】Both meta-analysis and case reports support the idea of recurrence. In a recent meta-analysis of 156 cases comparing catecholamine-induced (including pheochromocytoma amongst other secretory tumours and external administration) and non-catecholamine induced TS, Y-Hassan \\[ 8 \\] and Falhammar found the catecholamine-induced TS group exclusively demonstrated recurrence rate (16.8%; 18/107; \\[ 8 \\]). Preliminary data from the German Italian Spanish Takotsubo (GEIST) registry of 839 patients also found greater recurrence (17.7% vs 3.26%) \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. In cases of recurrence, normalization of left ventricular function is found on repeat echocardiogram (seen in our patient). From the literature, time between presentations is highly variable, ranging from 1 week to 6 years \\[ 10–12 \\], with a number of presentations between 2 and 3 \\[ 10–12 \\].\n\n【20】Catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system hyper-activation represents core pathophysiology of TS. Although catecholamine surge is associated with pheochromocytomas, the pathophysiology is not completely elucidated and this may be reflected in variability in presentations between PTS and TS. The symptomatology of adrenal tumours in general is broad and non-specific, and may be affected by sex. Regardless of histological subtype, both TS \\[ 4 \\] and adrenal tumours \\[ 13 \\] are more common in postmenopausal women, with advancing age and estrogen-deficiency risk factors for vasomotor changes and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, although signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma are variable and non-specific, females have also been suggested to present with significantly more symptoms irrespective of biological phenotype and tumour presentation \\[ 14 \\]. Compared with other causes of TS, PTS are less likely to be associated with chest pain (42.25 vs 75.9%), and present with labile blood pressure in nearly half (47.5%) of cases \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, hypertension did not occur. Despite its well-known association, it is important to keep in mind that hypertension is an unreliable symptom of pheochromocytoma in general—occurring in only 59% of cases \\[ 15 \\]—adding to diagnostic complexity.\n\n【21】The severity of complications in PTS compared to TS should also keep PTS an important differential. Catecholamine-induced TS are more likely to be associated with younger age, the apical sparing ballooning pattern on echocardiogram, more severe disease with lower LVEF (27.7 vs 41.1%), greater heart rate, greater complications (68.2 vs 21.8%), more cardiogenic shock (37.7 vs 9.9%) and greater use of inotropes (32.7 vs 12.2%; \\[ 3 , 7 \\]). Of published case reports, only three cases presented with cardiogenic shock, with a larger number (34.6%; 27/78) complicated by subsequent cardiogenic shock \\[ 7 \\]. The GEIST registry found right ventricular involvement (as seen in our patient) in TS to be rare (~11%), and significantly associated with cardiogenic shock and all-cause mortality \\[ 16 \\]. Symptom severity and greater complication rates may be attributable to the episodic and extreme nature of catecholamine surges in pheochromocytoma, which would impair coronary vasomotor function \\[ 17 \\], and over a prolonged period, may influence density of myocardial B1–B2-adrenoreceptors, 1 <sup>2 </sup> leading to further dysfunction.\n\n【22】The atypical nature of PTS may lead to diagnostic delays, as in this case, which is concerning given the increased rate of complications in this subgroup. As Shams et al. \\[ 10 \\] note, early diagnosis may avoid further damage caused by excessive use of inotropes, as well as use of beta blockers without adequate, prior alpha blockade. Hence, we suggest secretory adrenal tumours should be considered as a differential diagnosis for Takotsubo’s Syndrome—particularly, a subsequent presentation of sympathetic hyperactivation, and presentations in the post-menopausal female, should give clinicians a low threshold for screening.\n\n【23】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【24】The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n【25】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【26】The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Alcohol has been established to affect the autonomic function through liver injury and accumulation of vasodilators. Alcohol can induce peripheral neurological diseases as well. This case report describes a patient who had a chronic history of alcoholism and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus presenting for orthostatic hypotension and peripheral neuropathy without underlying liver disease or other endocrinopathies. Although diabetes mellitus was controlled pharmacologically and risk factors for orthostatic hypotension were managed conservatively, his symptoms did not improve which indicated an alcohol-related autonomic dysfunction, shedding light on one of long-term complications of alcoholism.\n\n【2】dysautonomia , neuropathy , alcohol\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】The autonomic nervous system, a division of the peripheral nervous system, coordinates the function of internal organs. It is made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. They are largely responsible for the involuntary, subconscious controls of viscera, smooth muscle and secretory glands \\[ 1 \\]. Autonomic dysfunction or dysautonomia is a neuropathy affecting the autonomic nervous system. The effect of alcoholism on autonomic function tests have been well established through the mechanism of liver injury. In this case report, we describe a 36-year-old patient, who struggled with alcoholism, and presented with multiple episodes of orthostatic hypotension found to be a sign of autonomic dysfunction exacerbated by alcoholism. Despite treatment and control of the risk factors, the autonomic dysfunction persisted upon a long period of follow-up.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 36-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 3-week history of multiple episodes of dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision and tinnitus after standing up. He also reported an episode of near-syncope with trauma to the head 1 day prior to presentation.\n\n【7】The aforementioned presentation was his third in a period of 3 weeks. He endorsed a 40 kg unintentional weight loss in the past 2 years. He had increased sleep, muscle and bone pains, tingling and numbness of his fingers and in his lower extremities distally to his knees.\n\n【8】Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in January 2017 with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.9% which increased to 10.5% in December 2018 few months before presentation. His diabetes mellitus was being treated with Metformin which he was not compliant with. He also had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated with Gabapentin, right cerebellar gliosis 2/2 to right frontal ventriculostomy along with a history of depression and alcoholism (reports drinking 10 beers per day for 2 years. Each beer is 24 oz. He quit 3 weeks prior to presentation). He did not report any intake of antidepressant therapy or sedatives.\n\n【9】He is a thin, pale man of Asian descent. There were no signs of dehydration such as dry mouth, lips and eyes. Orthostatic blood pressures: 148/97 mm Hg while sitting and 93/64 mm Hg upon standing. Generally normal body and neurological exams. Neurologic exam was normal. Tilt table test was not performed because the hospital does not have the specific facility for the test. Pertinent initial laboratory findings were: HbA1c 10.2%, AST 87 mg/dL and normal ALT. An EKG showed long QT segment with QTc = 0.53 s.\n\n【10】He was admitted for further work-up of dizziness. Twenty-four hour telemetry were unremarkable. No cardiac echocardiography was performed. No dehydration was suspected due to normal laboratory work-up.\n\n【11】During hospitalization, he was evaluated by an endocrinologist and extensive laboratory studies including PTH, 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin B12, Free T4, ACTH, Cortisol, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin and IGF-1 levels all returned normal. Serum aldosterone and renin levels were normal excluding adrenal insufficiency as a cause for orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【12】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to rule out any liver injury secondary to alcohol use was normal. A CT brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial injury. A right cerebellar gliosis was evident along with prior right frontal ventriculostomy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild gliosis in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere underlying a right occipital craniectomy and a mild right frontal gliosis along a prior shunt tract ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】T2 weighted MRI axial image showing right cerebellar gliosis related to a previous surgery.\n\n【16】He worked regularly with physical therapy and was taught posture stabilizing exercises, which improved his functional capacity and ambulatory abilities. He was diagnosed with dysautonomia secondary to alcoholism. His blood pressure improved to 130–140/70–80 mmHg with no significant drop on lying/standing measurements. He was discharged on midodrine 10 mg thrice daily, gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily and thiamine 100 mg daily.\n\n【17】In a 6-month follow-up visit, his HbA1c decreased to 6.5% being on insulin therapy. He denied any further alcohol intake. Although he was compliant to his medications, and was following instructions for management of his varicose veins, he still had intermittent episodes of orthostatic hypotension with blood pressure dropping occasionally to 100/50–60 mmHg. However, he did not report any further near-syncope episode. A gastrointestinal evaluation was scheduled because of significant weight loss.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Alcohol and its metabolites can increase the concentration of vasodilators such as nitric-oxide activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and increasing plasma levels of the vasoconstrictor–angiotensin II at higher doses \\[ 2 \\]. This will in return increase the sympathetic activity causing an increase in stroke volume as well as cardiac output due to sympathetic stimulation \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【20】Montforte _et al_ . \\[ 4 \\] studied 107 patients who struggled with alcoholism versus 61 control subjects to assess the functions of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems in patients. They found that 26 patients (24.3%) had autonomic neuropathy and 34 (32%) had peripheral neuropathy. They concluded that autonomic and peripheral neuropathies are common among patients with alcoholism, and that alcohol is toxic to both autonomic and peripheral nerves in a dose-dependent manner \\[ 4 \\]. This is the mechanism that we believe explains our patient’s symptoms as he was consuming over 240 ounces of beer daily for many years. Another study by Matikainen _et al_ . \\[ 5 \\] was performed on 28 male patients with alcoholism revealing significant polyneuropathy with neurophysiological findings in 7% of subjects. A delay in parasympathetic parameters could be detected in the alcoholics compared with controls.\n\n【21】The most common neuropathy that leads to autonomic dysfunction is diabetes mellitus. However, alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy (ALN) is another important etiology \\[ 6 \\]. Uncontrolled diabetes and alcoholism are both present in our patient. In recent studies, failure of thiamine treatment to reverse ALN, together with new information demonstrating clinical and electrophysiological distinctions between ALN and nutritional deficiency neuropathies, suggests that alcohol itself may significantly predispose and enhance development of neuropathy in the appropriate clinical setting \\[ 7 \\]. For example, neuropathy can still develop in alcoholics on who are not thiamine deficient \\[ 8 \\]. Moreover, subperineurial oedema is more prominent in thiamine deficient neuropathy, whereas segmental de/remyelination is more frequent in alcoholic neuropathy \\[ 9 \\]. Our patient reported mild improvement in neuropathy in the follow-up visits after receiving thiamine treatment, similar to Peters _et al_ . \\[ 10 \\] randomized controlled trial, and after improvement of HbA1c which leads us towards a diagnosis of ALN on top of his already established diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【22】In conclusion, alcohol metabolites can alter the endothelium leading to changes to the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems which can rarely persist for a long time despite control of risk factors.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【26】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【27】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】Not needed.\n\n【31】Verbal and written consents have been obtained from the patient.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Georges El Hasbani.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Laboratory findings were not suggestive of infections or autoimmune diseases; her serum tumor marker tests were negative. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed an irregular periaortic mass ( Fig. 2A1 and A2 ). Pericardial and pleural effusion aspirate was both unremarkable. Therefore, mediastinal mass biopsy was performed, suggesting sarcoma not otherwise specified. The tumor deemed unresectable.

She received therapy with corticosteroids, IVIg and Eltrombopag, but her platelet level was fluctuating and was difficult to achieve a well sustained response. A transient leukocytosis was noted but resolved by Eltrombopag dose reduction. Her pregnancy was complicated with preeclampsia with severe features required a prompt delivery. Although recent evidence supports the safety and efficacy of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy, unreported risks may underlie its use during pregnancy.\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Eltrombopag is one of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) that interacts with the transmembrane domain of the thrombopoietin receptor and triggers megakaryocytic growth and differentiation \\[ 1 \\]. In total, over 80% of the treated patients were reported to have increase in platelets by day 15 \\[ 2 \\]. However, its use during pregnancy is limited to case reports and case series, so cumulative evidence is necessary to safely administer Eltrombopag to pregnant women. Michel _et al._ reported a retrospective study of 15 patients (17 pregnancies) who received TPO-RAs for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in pregnancy, of which 10 pregnancies were administered Eltrombopag, and seven pregnancies Romiplostim \\[ 3 \\]. Of these 17 pregnancies, eight pregnancies showed complete response, six showed partial response and three showed no response. No adverse events or thromboembolic events were reported in these pregnancies, thus TPO-RAs have been started to be used in pregnant women worldwide. However, the data are limited due to the retrospective nature of the study, and data from East Asian population is lacking.\n\n【5】We here report a case of pregnancy complicated with refractory ITP and chronic hypertension (CH) managed with Eltrombopag, which resulted in superimposed preeclampsia (SPE) requiring subsequent termination at 27 weeks of gestation. Although she was managed without blood transfusion or comorbidity during peripartum period, we had difficulty in controlling platelet count only with Eltrombopag during the peripartum period.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-years-old nulliparous Japanese woman was diagnosed with ITP at age 16; who showed poor response to corticosteroids, splenectomy and rituximab, was referred to the obstetrics department for prenatal counseling. Due to the low platelet count which fluctuated around 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, pregnancy was not recommended since severe maternal hemorrhage was highly anticipated. However, she soon conceived naturally, and chose induced abortion at 11 weeks of gestation. At age 32, she again conceived naturally with platelet count of 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, but she was determined to continue her pregnancy despite of previously discussed risks. After consultation with hematologists, 10 mg of prednisolone was started at 8 weeks of gestation, but her platelet count showed no increase from 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was initiated at 10 weeks of gestation to confirm its effect, and it gradually increased from day 2, and reached the peak of 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 7, but decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at day 14. Although corticosteroids were ineffective, IVIg therapy showed temporal effect and it was repeated twice in 13th and 16th week of gestation as her platelet count again decreased to 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Since her platelet count showed no increase with steroids, and required repetitive administration of IVIg, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18 weeks of gestation with discontinuance of prednisolone. Platelets increased to 160 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in 14 days, but white blood cell count (WBC) also increased to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23 + 0 weeks of gestation. Consequently, her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl, thus the dosage was increased to 25 mg again at 26 + 0 weeks of gestation ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】The patient was administered corticosteroids and three times of immunoglobulin therapy in the first and second trimester. Eltrombopag 25mg/day was initiated from 18th week of gestation with discontinuance of corticosteroids. Eltrombopag was decreased to 12.5mg/day from 23rd week of gestation, but it resulted in the decrease in platelets, thus it was increased again to 25mg/day at 26th week of gestation. Immunoglobulin therapy was combined to Eltrombopag after admission due to SPE, which resulted in rapid increase in the platelet count. PLT: platelet count, PSL: corticosteroid.\n\n【11】Upon her maternal checkup at 12 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 147/96 and she was diagnosed as CH and was given 750 mg/day of oral methyldopa, but we refrained from starting low dose aspirin due to its antiplatelet effect. We increased methyldopa to 1500 mg at 25 + 4 weeks of gestation since her blood pressure increased to 145/95 mmHg. However, hypertension deteriorated to 200/110 mmHg and she complained of headache at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with SPE with urine protein of 1010 mg/day and was hospitalized. Intravenous nicardipine was initiated with 2 mg/h and magnesium sulfate with 1 g/h, and her blood pressure was controlled below 140/90 mmHg, and her headache resolved. Two betamethasone injections of 12 mg were given 24 h apart to prepare for delivery. Platelet count was still 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at 27 + 0 weeks of gestation and IVIg was started to prepare for the deterioration of SPE which may require prompt termination. At 27 + 3 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 169/100 even after administration of nicardipine 3 mg/h, and she also showed pulmonary edema with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 90% and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 57.7 mmHg ( Fig. 2 ). Therefore, caesarian section was decided due to maternal pulmonary edema from SPE and her platelet count was 130 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> / μl before the surgery. The surgery took 1 h and 9 min with blood loss of 1400 ml. A female neonate weighed 714 g with Apgar score of 4/8 (1 min and 5 min, respectively) and her platelet count was 68 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl at birth. As the neonate’s platelet count dropped to 33 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl within 8 h, IVIg (400 mg/kg/day) was initiated and the platelets were maintained over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl.\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】The patient developed pulmonary edema due to SPE. The chest X-ray shows butterfly pulmonary opacities with dull cardiopulmonary angles.\n\n【15】After surgery, her platelet count was consistently over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl and she was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks after delivery. Upon her visit at 6 weeks after delivery, she was still on 12.5 mg/day of Eltrombopag with platelet count of 23 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. The platelet count of the infant was constantly over 100 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl with no transfusion or medication and was discharged 144 days after birth without any comorbidity.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】ITP can occur during any trimester, and preexisting ITP can deteriorate during pregnancy. There is no concrete consensus on the management of ITP during pregnancy, but it is generally recommended to maintain the platelet count over 30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In the present case, her platelet count was 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl in the first trimester. We confirmed that she was responsive to IVIg in the first trimester, but since she was not responsive to steroids, we initiated Eltrombopag with 25 mg/day at 18th week of gestation. However, the dosage was decreased to 12.5 mg/day at 23rd week of gestation due to the unusual increase in WBC, which again required increase to 25 mg/day at 26th week of gestation, since her platelet count decreased to 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. Adequate control of her platelet count could not be achieved only with Eltrombopag, thus we added IVIg therapy to control her platelet count after the onset of SPE.\n\n【18】When treatment is indicated against ITP, corticosteroid is chosen as an initial therapy and IVIg therapy is generally chosen to raise the platelet count in preparation for delivery in patients refractory to steroids. On the other hand, other treatment options chosen in non-pregnant patients are not recommended during pregnancy \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. However, recent studies suggest the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs during pregnancy and has shed light on the poor responders \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. According to the United States Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), the initial dose is 50 mg/day, but East Asians are recommended to reduce the initial dose to 25 mg/day, since plasma Eltrombopag concentration was 50–55% higher in East Asian population as compared to non-East Asians, thus our initial dosage was 25 mg/day \\[ 7 \\]. In fact, the present case required reduction from 25 mg/day to 12.5 mg/day due to the unusual increase in WBC to 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl. As some studies have reported that TPO-RAs may increase the risk of myeloid fibrosis, we decreased the dosage \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Although there has been no report of leukocytosis in previous pregnant ITP cases, not only platelets but also WBC should be carefully monitored during Eltrombopag use especially in East Asian population.\n\n【19】Eltrombopag had been assigned to ‘category C’ by the FDA in pregnancy, since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Eltrombopag use in pregnancy. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, there was evidence of embryo lethality and reduced fetal weights at maternally toxic doses. Thus, Eltrombopag should be used only when benefit outweighs its risk during pregnancy after thorough discussion with the patient. In our case, due to the uncertainty of the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy, we did not recommend its use during pregnancy especially in the first trimester, but since she wished to continue her pregnancy, it was started from the second trimester after thorough discussion with the patient.\n\n【20】Preconception counseling is the pivotal first step in the management of ITP patients who wish to conceive. Considering the high prevalence of SPE in CH patients of up to 26% \\[ 10 \\], and possible deterioration of thrombocytopenia with SPE, patients with CH and ITP require thorough preconception counseling to share the obstetrical risks with the health care provider. As for prenatal management, in patients refractory to corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to use Eltrombopag to increase platelet count starting from the second trimester after thorough counseling. This case failed in acquiring adequate control of the platelet count only with Eltrombopag, and severe leukocytosis and early onset of SPE occurred, although the relation between SPE and Eltrombopag is unclear. Informing the possibility of these previously unknown risks of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy to the patient prior to conception may be necessary in patients with ITP and CH who require Eltrombopag use, especially in East Asian population.\n\n【21】This is the first case report of an East Asian woman with ITP and CH who used Eltrombopag to maintain her platelet count during pregnancy. She developed SPE at 27 weeks of gestation requiring prompt termination of pregnancy, and she required IVIg along with Eltrombopag to raise her platelet count for caesarian section. Controlling platelet count with Eltrombopag seems reasonable when other options are unavailable during pregnancy, but its dosage should be controlled with monitoring of WBC as well, especially in East Asian population. Well-controlled study to validate the safety of Eltrombopag use during pregnancy is waited.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】The design of this work has been approved by the University of Tokyo ethical committee.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】Informed patient consent has been obtained.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】Seisuke Sayama.\n\n【32】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【33】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The treatment of nail psoriasis is essential to improve the health outcomes and quality of life among patients. Pain associated with intralesional injections, inadequate penetration into the nail and underlying tissue, poor adherence to therapy, limited efficacy and recurrent relapses are among the many challenging issues with topical therapy. While conventional systemic therapies are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis. We report a case of nail psoriasis improved with treatment by risankizumab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Psoriasis is a widespread chronic skin condition mediated by the immune system. It affects the skin, nails and joints with systemic involvement and has a major negative impact on the quality of life of affected patients \\[ 1 \\]. Psoriasis has a global prevalence of 2% with observed regional variations \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】Psoriasis has various clinical manifestations and subtypes, with psoriasis vulgaris being the most common. It classically presents as well-demarcated, erythematous, itchy plaques covered with silvery scales \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【5】Approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis demonstrate nail involvement \\[ 2 \\]. This percentage can reach up to 90% in patients with psoriatic arthritis \\[ 2 \\]. Nail psoriasis can impair the quality of life as it may trigger a major social issue, and if left untreated, progress to weaken the nails that can lead to impairment of function \\[ 3 \\]. Nail psoriasis is challenging to treat and is often resistant to treatment. On the other hand, treating it improves patients’ health outcomes and standard of living \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【6】Nails are known to be epidermal appendages, and are as such, usually affected by psoriasis. Nail disease clinically can involve either the matrix, the nail bed or the periungual tissue, depending on the origin of the inflammatory phase, resulting in distinct injury patterns \\[ 4 \\]. Features such as leukonychia, pitting (punctures or cupuliform depressions), red spots in the lunula and crumbling can result in patients with nail matrix involvement. Onycholysis, salmon or oil-drop patches, subungual hyperkeratosis and splinter hemorrhages may be caused by nail bed involvement \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【7】Psoriasis therapy has advanced tremendously. While conventional systemic therapies as well as intralesional corticosteroids are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, other treatment options are required for a large proportion of patients, with anticipated improvement in effectiveness \\[ 1 , 5 \\].\n\n【8】There are many challenging issues that we face when treating patients with nail psoriasis which can include: pain associated with intralesional injections, side effects and monitoring of systemic medications, inadequate penetration of topical medications into the nail and underlying tissue and patient adherence to therapy \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【10】We report a case of a 20-year-old male who is not known to have any medical illnesses. He presented with a 2-year history of nail dystrophy and tenderness. It initially involved the left thumb nail then progressed to involve almost all fingernails. Patient denied any history of skin lesions or joint pain. Moreover, no similar history was noted in the family. He visited the primary care clinic where he was diagnosed with onychomycosis based on positive nail culture for candida albicans and treated accordingly with oral terbinafine for 2 weeks then he was given oral fluconazole 300 mg once weekly for 6 weeks. However, no improvement was noted upon follow-up and the patient was referred to dermatology. On examination, bilateral fingernails were found to have trachonychia and longitudinal ridging except the right index and little fingernails ( Figs 1A and 2A ). The toenails were clear and no skin or scalp lesions were noted.\n\n【11】Figure 1\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Right hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and right hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Left hand fingernails prior to treatment showing trachonychia and longitudinal ridging (A), and left hand fingernails 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment (B).\n\n【17】A nail biopsy was taken, which showed hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and neutrophils in the nail plate, and came negative for grocott methenamine silver stain ( Fig. 3 ). The diagnosis of psoriasis was then made.\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Nail biopsy histopathology showing hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and neutrophils in the nail plate (A and B).\n\n【21】The patient was started on subcutaneous adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks with minimal improvement of nail psoriasis after 9 months of treatment. In addition, during adalimumab therapy, the patient developed cutaneous psoriatic lesions over the extremities following the third dose of adalimumab ( Fig. 4 ). He was switched to subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg (at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter). Significant improvement was noted at 12 weeks of rizankizumab therapy, where the patient reported 70% subjective improvement of the affected fingernails, with no new involvement of previously unaffected nails, and clearance of skin psoriasis ( Figs 1B and 2B ).\n\n【22】Figure 4\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Round erythematous plaques with overlying white scales developed during adalimumab therapy.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】It is essential to treat nail psoriasis because of its association with a decreased quality of life and dysfunction in daily life activities \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【27】Disease control involves patient’s education, avoidance of nail trauma and different therapeutic approaches with physical and pharmaceutical agents \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【28】The first line therapy in the management of nail psoriasis is topical medications such as corticosteroids, calcipotriol, retinoids and calcineurin inhibitors \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. However, the efficacy of these medications in nail disease is limited, primarily due to the difficulty of penetrating the nail bed and nail matrix and the lack of patient compliance \\[ 3 , 5 \\].\n\n【29】Current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【30】Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively targets the special human IL-23 p19 subunit without binding to IL-12. Thus, it inhibits pro-inflammatory activities \\[ 1 \\]. In February 2019, Risankizumab was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis as well as psoriatic arthritis \\[ 6 \\]. Risankizumab is indicated in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【31】Our patient suffered from nail psoriasis with no skin or joint involvement. However, it involved almost all of the fingernails, significantly impairing his quality of life and resulting in significant distress. Therefore, biologic agents were the desirable option by the patient given their efficacy and quick results. Edward _et al._ proposed a practical treatment algorithm for nail psoriasis depending on the number of nails involved and the significance of skin and joint involvement and quality of life impairment \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【32】Similar to our patient’s response to adalimumab, TNF-alpha inhibitors are known to cause paradoxical psoriasis or worsening of pre-existing psoriasis when used for chronic immune-mediated diseases, primarly inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【33】In one study comparing a placebo, ustekinumab and risankizumab, risankizumab demonstrated excellent efficacy with higher Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 rates, along with a convenient maintenance dosing regimen every 12 weeks. Risankizumab was well tolerated, with upper respiratory tract infection being the most frequent adverse event \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【34】This case represents the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in the treatment of nail psoriasis unresponsive to adalimumab. Risankizumab is well-tolerated with a dosing regimen of every 12 weeks. This allows for improved patient compliance and patient satisfaction.\n\n【35】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【36】None.\n\n【37】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【38】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【39】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【40】None.\n\n【41】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【42】A case report does not require ethical approval in accordance with local guidelines.\n\n【43】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【44】Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the photographs and medical information to be published.\n\n【45】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【46】Abdulmajeed AlAjlan, Raghda Qasim, Fatimah AlTassan, Tala Qadoumi and Tuqa AlKaff.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A non-contrasted head CT was obtained, which demonstrated a hyperdense image compatible with an intracerebral hemorrhage in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe. The patient displayed no neurological deficit during the consultation and a subsequent MRI showed a temporoinsular bleeding lesion that was suggestive of an atypic meningioma or a metastatic lesion. Afterwards, neck, chest and abdomen CT scans were performed, and the imaging ruled out a secondary neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion, and a solid tumor was found with no bleeding associated. The pathology reported a WHO I fibroblastic meningioma.\n\n【2】fibroblastic meningioma , intracerebral hemorrhage , magnetic resonance image , computerized tomography\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Hemorrhagic strokes account for 15% of all strokes and are widely accepted to be deadlier than ischemic strokes. The 30-day mortality rate of patients presenting intracranial hemorrhage is ~50%, in comparison with an estimated 20% rate for patients that have experienced ischemic strokes \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【5】The most common cause of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is thought to be chronic hypertension. The small perforating end branches are especially vulnerable to damage from elevated blood pressure in locations such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and pons.\n\n【6】Although all brain tumors are known to convey a risk of bleeding, medical teams tend to associate tumoral intra-cerebral hemorrhages with the presence of malignancies. The types of malignant tumors that are most associated with localized hemorrhages are glioblastomas, lymphomas, oligodendrogliomas and metastatic tumors, the last of which encompass melanomas, choriocarcinomas, renal cell carcinomas and bronchogenic carcinomas \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Contrastingly, the types of benign tumors that have been associated with intracerebral hemorrhages include meningiomas, pituitary adenomas and hemangioblastomas \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【7】The factors that determine the prognosis and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the patient’s age, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, the location of hematoma and the presence of an intra-ventricular component. All the aforementioned factors are also considered to calculate the intracranial hemorrhage score \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 50-year-old patient presented to the emergency room complaining of having suffered, for an entire day, from a sudden pulsatile hemicranial headache of moderate intensity, associated with nausea, no emetic episodes and that was also not responding to the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Due to the persistence of the symptomatology, the patient sought medical attention and the initial diagnosis suggested a secondary headache. After careful examination, the patient was found to be free of neurological deficit and the medical team performed a brain CT scan.\n\n【10】The resulting image documented a cortico-subcortical hyperdense lesion (50 Hounsfield Units) in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe, measuring 41 × 32 × 36 mm and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc, commonly associated with cases of vasogenic edema compromising the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The amplitude of the left lateral ventricle and the width of the regional subarachnoid space sulci had decreased on account of the lesion, and a minimal deviation of the midline structures to the right and incipient left uncal herniation was noted. ( Fig. 1 ). To rule out an underlying vascular malformation, the medical team performed a CT angiogram, which did not show any aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.\n\n【11】**Figure 1**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Head computerized tomography CT.\n\n【14】Due to the absence of neurological deficit, the medical team propounded that a brain hemorrhage could not be adjudged as the sole etiology and subsequently ordered an MRI scan. The results revealed a lobulated mass with prominent enhancement after the gadolinium injection and marked hypo intensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information. A zone in contact with the internal bone table was observed at the lateral margin of the lesion, as well as various dark regions at the susceptibility weighted sequence, suggesting blood products or calcium. The FLAIR sequence showed significant surrounding vasogenic edema. The aforementioned characteristics were found to be consistent with an atypical meningioma or a metastatic lesion ( Figs 2 – 4 ).\n\n【15】**Figure 2**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】MRI—fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence.\n\n【18】**Figure 3**\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】MRI—susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence.\n\n【21】**Figure 4**\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】MRI—gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequence.\n\n【24】Additional neck, chest and abdominal CT scans were performed, and the results allowed the ruling out of metastatic disease, furthermore, increasing the probability of an underlying primary tumor of the central nervous system. The patient underwent surgery, where resulted in the identification of a solid lesion, without an intra-tumoral hemorrhagic component, as previously suspected in accordance with the pre-operative imaging findings ( Figs 5 and 6 ).\n\n【25】**Figure 5**\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】Macroscopic lesion.\n\n【28】**Figure 6**\n\n【29】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【30】Macroscopic lesion.\n\n【31】After the surgical intervention, the patient presented a stable neurological evolution with no apparent deterioration and was discharged following 4 days of post-operative surveillance. During the post-operative follow-up, the pathology report revealed the existence of spindle cells fascicles intersected along with variable collagen deposition and occasional cellular whorls (in the hematoxylin–eosin staining— Fig. 7 ). The tumor also tested positive for EMA in patches and Vimentin ( Fig. 8 ). These findings were deemed compatible with the diagnosis of fibroblastic meningioma WHO I, emphasizing that they were not suggestive of anaplastic meningioma or atypical meningioma.\n\n【32】**Figure 7**\n\n【33】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【34】Hematoxylin–eosin staining.\n\n【35】**Figure 8**\n\n【36】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【37】Vimentin staining.\n\n【38】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【39】The radiological findings in this case are particularly intriguing, due to the fact that the initial evaluation suggested a large acute hemorrhagic component—because of its high density in scans (50 Hounsfield Units) and its marked hypointensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information—but, at the time of the surgical resection, a mass of solid consistency was found, without any type of hemorrhage.\n\n【40】Given that acute blood is markedly hyperdense in comparison to the brain parenchyma, its tomographic diagnosis regularly does not pose a high grade of difficulty for medical teams. However, in this case, we were faced with an entirely solid lesion that mimicked an intracerebral hemorrhage. The tests ordered by the medical team included a CT angiogram to rule out a possible vascular etiology, as the patient’s symptomatology was not consistent with a primary hemorrhage. In the authors’ opinion, this is the most significant aspect of this case study, in terms of its possible contribution to medical literature and its potential of serving as reference material for other healthcare professionals assessing patients who report a similar array of symptoms.\n\n【41】In developing nations, medical institutions are typically constrained by multiple external factors that directly compromise the availability of primary imaging techniques, such as MRI scanning. In cases where diagnostic MRI equipment is found to be entirely unavailable, medical teams must judiciously evaluate each patient’s condition, to determine whether he should be immediately referred to a higher level facility or remain under surveillance after a CT scan. In this case, the patient presented to the ER with a diagnosis of a ‘large intracerebral hemorrhage’ but displayed no neurological deficit. Such a scenario was deemed unlikely by the medical team, given the absence of cognitive impairment, and thus, the symptoms were thought to be the result of a slow-growing lesion.\n\n【42】In accordance with the findings of this case, the authors pose that all medical teams evaluating the results of a Head CT scan must consider the correlation between the images and the patient’s neurological status (i.e. a patient with no neurological deficit, associated with a large hyperdense lesion, most probably relates to a tumor with intra-lesional hemorrhage, rather than a single hemorrhage). Additionally, this case allowed the authors to identify a valuable opportunity in the development of a computer-based algorithm—specially directed at medical centers with CT scanners, but lacking MRI imaging equipment—which marks the cases in which an extra imaging study should be ordered, starting with those ‘hyperdense lesions’ located in eloquent areas with no neurological deficit association.\n\n【43】As it was stated before, the patient’s neurological status during admission was undamaged, which is highly unlikely in patients with hemorrhages in the same location and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc. Had that been the case for our patient, at least, a minimum degree of neurological compromise would have been expected, as the volume of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is directly proportional to morbidity and mortality \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【44】Type III collagen is a member of the fibrillar collagen family and is colocalized with the most abundant member of the family, type I collagen, in such tissues as blood vessels \\[8\\], leading the medical team to the conclusion that the high content of intercellular collagen and reticulin was the most probable cause for the hyperdensity evidenced in the tomographic image and the hypodensity on T2 weighted images, and for the dark areas evidenced on the susceptibility weighted images, thereby mimicking an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage.\n\n【45】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【46】The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Julian Gualdrón-Durán in the edition and preparation of this manuscript.\n\n【47】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【48】None declared.\n\n【49】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【50】None declared.\n\n【51】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【52】The case report was reviewed and accepted by the institutional review board from our institution.\n\n【53】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【54】Full verbal and written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.\n\n【55】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【56】Dr Oscar Hernando Feo-Lee is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Our case is of a 50-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic lower anterior resection for the rectal cancer with lung metastasis 4 years ago developed cardiac tamponade due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. We performed pericardiocentesis as a temporary life-saving procedure, but pericardial fluid re-accumulated within a few days. She died 23 days after admission. When a patient with advanced colorectal cancer complains dyspnea, we should consider the pericardial metastasis, and perform the proper treatment as this case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Distant metastases of colorectal cancer are often hematogenous, and liver metastasis are the most common affected site \\[ 1 \\]. Pericardial metastasis is one of the rarer patterns of hematogenous metastasis of colorectal cancer, but it is very difficult to diagnose before death and even rarer to cause symptomatic cardiac tamponade \\[ 2 \\]. We need requiring prompt management within a few hours or days for cardiac tamponade. But there are no established therapy after acute phase. This report describes a rare case of pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer, along with a literature review.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old woman presented to the hospital complaining of anemia. Her medical history included hyperthyroidism, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, urolithiasis, and panic disorder. She has no smoking history. She was diagnosed with a circumferential Type 2 tumor of the upper rectum in colonoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the circumferential wall, with a contrast effect in the upper rectum, a swollen #251 lymph node, and three pulmonary nodules suspected to be metastases ( Fig. 1 ). Laparoscopic lower anterior resection and lymph node dissection were performed to prevent intestinal obstruction due to the tumor. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated for lung metastases. A CT scan 4 years postoperatively revealed pericardial thickening ( Fig. 2 ). She had no subjective symptoms and only mild pericardial fluid retention, and chemotherapy was continued. Two months after the CT finding, she was brought to the emergency room due to respiratory distress. At admission, she presented with tachycardia and Beck’s triad (hypotension, venous distension and diminished heart sounds). CT scans revealed lung metastases of rectal cancer and accumulation of pleural effusion and pericardial fluid ( Fig. 2 ). Cardiologists confirmed the findings of pericardial fluid retention and a sign of right ventricle collapse on echography.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Images at the time of rectal cancer surgery.

Palpitation and dyspnea improved, and the patient’s breathing calmed down. A few days later, re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was noted. We performed a pathological examination of the collected pericardial fluid ( Fig. 3 ). In cytology, papanicolaou staining revealed atypical epithelial-like cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular shapes. Alcian blue staining revealed a small number of atypical cells with cytoplasmic mucin. In cell block immunohistochemistry, atypical cells were positive for CEA (Mono) and CDX-2, but negative for Calretinin, WT-1 and CD68 (PGM1). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion due to pericardial metastasis of rectal cancer. She was started on diuretics, but pericardial fluid quickly accumulated, gradually deteriorating her general condition. She died 23 days after emergency hospitalisation.\n\n【13】Figure 3\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Pathology. (A) Pathology of rectal cancer \\[hematoxylin eosin (HE) stain\\].

(E) Pericardial fluid (cell block method, CEA(mono) stain).\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Rectal cancer are often diagnosed with the metastasis. The most common mode of metastasis in rectal cancer is hematogenous, with the liver being the most common distant metastatic site, followed by the lungs \\[ 1 \\]. This is because, unlike colon cancer, rectal cancer drains from the distal rectal vein through the middle and inferior rectal veins to the internal iliac vein, and thus hematogenous metastasis is likely to occur bypassing the portal hepatic circulation. This may be the reason why the tumor cells directly extended into the pericardial tissue.\n\n【18】Cardiac metastasis of malignant tumors is a relatively common form of metastasis in the terminal stage of cancer. But it is rare to be diagnosed with pericardial metastasis of a tumor during life. This is because many cases of pericardial effusion due to cancer are not accompanied by chest pain and have a poor inflammatory response \\[ 2 \\], so they are often not noticed until cardiac tamponade occurs. Symptomatic carcinomatous pericarditis has been reported in male patients with lung cancer and female patients with breast cancer \\[ 3 \\], but rarely in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n【19】Treatment of cardiac tamponade in cancer patients includes systemic chemotherapy, pericardial adhesion therapy, and pericardial incision. Pericardial drainage is often used as a temporary life-saving procedure, but re-accumulation of pericardial fluid occurs in roughly 60% of patients treated with pericardial drainage alone \\[ 4 \\]. Thus, many patients continue to require further treatment to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. Pericardial incision may be performed during the first cardiac tamponade in order to prevent pericardial fluid re-accumulation. However, surgery is considered a difficult option due to concerns about surgical tolerance and postoperative quality of life, as many patients are in the terminal stages of the disease. After releasing pericardial fluid retention, systemic administration of antineoplastic drugs may prolong survival. In recent years, pericardial adhesion therapy by anticancer drugs has been performed as a new treatment to address cardiac tamponade. A JCOG study conducted in Japan reported that bleomycin or cisplatin is recommended for lung cancer, and thiotepa or cisplatin is recommended for breast cancer \\[ 5 \\]. However, no effective anticancer drugs have been reported for colorectal cancer.\n\n【20】A review of the literature using PubMed (keywords ‘colorectal cancer’ and ‘pericardial metastasis’) identified only five cases \\[ 6–10 \\] of cardiac tamponade with an antemortem diagnosis of pericardial metastasis from colorectal cancer, excluding current cases are excluded. In all cases, patients visited the hospital with acute onset respiratory distress. Pericardiocentesis was performed in four of the cases. Surgery was performed with or without pericardiocentesis in three cases; only one was successful, and one died during surgery. Pericardial adhesion therapy was performed in one patient, but the effect was poor. Percutaneous drainage was also performed early in our case, and temporarily relieved the cardiac tamponade. Although early re-accumulation of pericardial fluid was observed after pericardiocentesis in this patient, surgery was not performed because of his general condition and poor prognosis, and the best supportive care policy was adopted.\n\n【21】Advances in medical care have made it possible for patients with distant metastases to survive for a long period of time. When a cancer patient with distant metastasis presents with dyspnea due to pericardial tamponade, it is necessary to not only provide first aid to relieve symptoms but also to submit the collected pericardial fluid for pathological examination to diagnose whether the pericardial effusion is due to pericardial metastasis. And we need to pursue further treatments for long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients with pericardial metastasis.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】Not applicable.\n\n【26】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Not applicable.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】We explained the clinical trials and disclosure of information to the patient’s family and obtained written consent.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】Junichi Mazaki, MD.\n\n【32】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【33】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

An ectopic primary meningioma (extracranial meningiomas), which accounts for 1–2% of all primary meningiomas, is rare: occurs in several locations, such as the head-and-neck region, skin, bone, peripheral nerves, retroperitoneum and lung \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Some previous studies reported that extracranial meningioma might derive from misplaced or migrate arachnoid cells, while other previous studies reported that the tumor may originate from perineurial cells or pluripotent mesenchymal cells \\[ 2 \\]. The true etiology of this tumor is still uncertain \\[ 3 \\]. Primary pulmonary meningioma is extremely rare and so far only <45 cases have been reported in the English literature since its first report by Kemnitz and Heinrich \\[ 1 , 4–6 \\]. Among these cases, only five cases were malignant or atypical \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. As far as we investigated, no case of malignant or atypical primary pulmonary meningioma with bone metastasis has been reported.\n\n【4】**Figure 1**\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】X-ray showed osteolytic lesion in the left femur.\n\n【7】**Figure 2**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】(A) PET-CT suspected multiple bone metastasis including frontal bone, mandible, left scapula, rib, vertebra, pubis, left femur and sternum; (B) MRI showed enhanced mass in the sternum.\n\n【10】**Figure 3**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Tumor cells in the surgical specimen of the lung showed typical whorl formation.\n\n【13】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【14】A 67-year-old female with primary pulmonary meningioma underwent thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection of the left lower lobe a year before in our hospital. She had been aware of left thigh pain for the last 9 months, then she was referred to our division. X-ray showed osteolytic lesion in the left femur ( Fig. 1 ). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) suspected multiple bone metastasis including frontal bone, mandible, left scapula, rib, vertebra, pubis, left femur and sternum ( Fig. 2A ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhanced mass in the sternum, which may be pricked with a needle biopsy easily ( Fig. 2B ). A needle biopsy of the sternum was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was consistent with metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade III. Tumor cells in the surgical specimen of the lung showed typical whorl formation and positive of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and vimentin in immunohistochemical staining ( Figs 3 and 4 ). Tumor cells of the biopsy specimen showed malignant progression with high Ki-67 index; EMA and vimentin were also positive in immunohistochemical staining ( Fig. 5 ). We started to treat the patient with denosumab and radiation therapy targeting the left femur. Two months after the treatment, the mass showed radiological partial response and the pain had decreased, she could walk with no cane.\n\n【15】**Figure 4**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】EMA and vimentin were positive in immunohistochemical staining.

EMA and vimentin were positive in immunohistochemical staining. Ki-67 index was partially beyond 20%. Histopathological diagnosis was metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, WHO grade III.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】A primary pulmonary meningioma is extremely rare, but may mimic any other pulmonary tumor presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule \\[ 7 \\]. As far as we investigated only <45 cases have been reported so far since its first report by Kemnitz and Heinrich \\[ 4–6 \\]. Among these cases, only five cases were malignant or atypical \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. A primary pulmonary meningioma is largely benign, grows slowly and has an excellent prognosis. Incarbone _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] reviewed 37 cases of primary pulmonary meningiomas reported in the literature. Among 25 histologically confirmed primary pulmonary meningioma patients with radiological data of the CNS and histological assessment, 23 (92%) cases had benign and 2 (8%) cases had a malignant primary pulmonary meningioma.\n\n【23】Dalle Ore _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] reviewed 1193 patients treated for meningioma including intracranial meningiomas. Ten patients had extracranial lesions suspicious for metastasis. At biopsy, eight were meningioma metastasis, one patient was a non-meningioma malignancy and the other patient was lost to follow-up prior to biopsy. Biopsy-confirmed metastasis occurred in the liver (5), lung (3), mediastinum (1) and bone (1). The observed incidence of metastasis was 0.67% ( _n_ \\= 8). Incidence increased to 2% of WHO grade II and 8.6% of grade III meningiomas. Among these patients, no case of extracranial meningioma with bone metastasis has been reported.\n\n【24】We have reported rare case of malignant extracranial meningioma with multiple bone metastasis. By needle biopsy, we confirmed histopathological diagnosis as metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, WHO grade III. Moreover, pathology of the surgical specimen showed some vascular invasions in Fig. 4 , suggesting malignant behavior. In conclusion, our experience with the present case in primary pulmonary meningioma has shown that we should think about extracranial meningioma as differential diagnosis in case of the patient with bone metastasis. The patients with extracranial meningioma should therefore be carefully monitored.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【26】We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.\n\n【27】Conflict of Interest statement\n------------------------------\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】Funding\n-------\n\n【30】None.\n\n【31】Ethical Approval\n----------------\n\n【32】The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication and gave their consent.

There was also mild pulmonary regurgitation. The PV annulus was non-dilated. The main and left pulmonary arteries were moderately dilated (32 and 28 mm, respectively), with high-normal right pulmonary artery dimensions (21 mm). Biventricular volumes and function were normal.

We report a 13-year-old male who presented with progressively increasing swellings at the right shoulder and right mid-thigh for one month. Radiological images revealed lytic destructive lesions associated with soft tissue masses in both sites and a pathological fracture on the right humerus. The patient had no significant medical history. Histological, immunohistochemical and fluorescent in-situ hybridization assessment of biopsies from the lesions confirmed the diagnosis of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the patient was unable to follow-up treatment and died shortly after establishment of the diagnosis. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is of serious concern when it comes to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone is defined as a malignant lymphoid neoplasm producing at least one mass within bone without the involvement of extra-regional lymph nodes and extra-nodal sites for at least 6 months. The presence however of regional lymph nodes in due course of the disease does not exclude the diagnosis \\[ 1 \\]. The tumours are rare, comprising <1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Radiologically they have a wide variety of presentation, sometimes with a virtually normal X-ray with a large soft tissue mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\[ 4 \\]. The histological diagnosis of these lymphomas may be a daunting task related to the rarity of its presentation, thus scrupulous immunohistochemical studies are essential for the definitive diagnosis \\[ 1–3 \\]. Herein, we report the case of a 13-year-old male with a primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone involving femur and humerus and a brief review of the literature.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 13-year-old boy was brought to our centre because of nearly simultaneously started swellings at the right shoulder and right mid-thigh with duration of 1 month. Each swelling was gradual in nature and progressively increased over time. The patient reported progressive weight loss and dizziness. His parents were peasants and his past medical history was unremarkable. Given the profession of the parents exposure to pesticides was considered, this could however not be documented.\n\n【6】On general examination, he was weak, pale, wasted and tachycardic with a pulse rate of136 beats/minute. Blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature were within normal limits. On local examination, he had a firm round, non-tender, immobile swelling (11 × 5 cm) at the right shoulder ( Fig. 1 A). At the right mid-thigh, he had a circumferential fixed and non-tender (12 × 10cm), ( Fig. 1B ). Laboratory findings revealed the haemoglobin of 8.5 g/dl (11‑15 g/dl), raised ESR of 28 mm/h (0‑19 mm/1 h), normal leukocytes 6.13 × 109/L (4.00–11.00)/l and AST: 40.60 (5–40)/l. Serum creatinine 93 (62‑106 μmol/l), AST 40.60u/l (2.00–40.00 U/l), ALT 15.90 U/l (2.00–41.00 U/l). Other parameters including a bone marrow aspirate were essentially normal.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】A photograph showing swellings of the right shoulder ( **A** ), and right thigh ( **B** ) with surgical scars and suture marks in both following incision biopsies.\n\n【10】Conventional radiography of the right femur demonstrated a huge soft tissue swelling with diffuse permeative lesions in the mid and distal femoral shaft and medial cortical destruction ( Fig. 2A ). The right shoulder revealed large soft tissue swelling associated with a pathological fracture of the proximal humerus, ( Fig. 2B ). Chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvis ultrasound were normal i.e. no signs of metastasis seen. A diagnosis of sarcoma was suggested. Biopsies from the lesions were taken and the patient was discharged with a plan to start treatment in 2 weeks after establishing the histopathological diagnosis.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】X-ray showing diffuse permeative lesion of mid and right distal femoral shaft associated with a large soft tissue mass ( **A** ), and right shoulder mass associated with proximal humeral destruction and a pathological fracture ( **B** ).\n\n【14】Histopathological findings of the two lesions highlighted a similar morphology showing diffuse proliferation of monotonous medium to large-sized atypical lymphocytic cell population ( Fig. 3 A and B). Using the limited immunohistochemical panel tests that were locally available, tumour cells were strongly positive for CD20 and CD45 ( Fig. 4A and B ), but negative with CD99 and cytokeratin 20. Diagnosis of a primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone (DLBCL) with differential of Ewing sarcoma was made. Due to the rarity of the disease entity, tumour tissue blocks were shipped to Leiden University Medical Center, (Leiden, The Netherlands) for expert consultation. There, wider immunohistochemical panel tests and FISH for EWSR1 split, FUS split, BCOR split and CIC split were performed. All split-apart FISH showed the absence of split signals of tested genomic regions thus excluded the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma and other small blue round cell tumor (SBRCT). Immunohistochemical staining were conclusive for the diagnosis of DLBCL (CD45+, CD20+ while CD99, Desmin, MYOD1, PAS negative). The Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the patient could not manage to turn back for oncological treatment. Unfortunately, he succumbed ~30 days post-hospital discharge.\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Histopathology of the right-shoulder mass showing diffuse lymphoid cellular proliferation, H&E, ×40 primary magnification ( **A** ), and femur mass demonstrating a diffuse atypical lymphoid cell population, H& E, ×100 primary magnification.\n\n【18】**Figure 4**\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Strong immunopositivity of the tumour cells with CD 45 IHC, ×40 primary magnification ( **A** ) and CD20 IHC ×60 primary magnification ( **B** ).\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Primary bone lymphoma is uncommon disease accounting for <5% of extranodal lymphoma and <1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Slight male preponderance has been documented and can occur at any age, with a mean age of 48 years \\[ 1–5 \\]. The vast majority are B-cell lymphoma. Interestingly, these tumours can be mixed with reactive CD8+ T-cell infiltrates which can be confusing for recognizing it as a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin \\[ 6 \\]. The density of the CD8+ T-cell infiltration and expression of BCL2 has proven to be of prognostic value \\[ 6 \\]. At the tumour-genetic level, these lymphomas characteristically show a gain of chromosome 1q and amplification of 2p16.1 confirming their germinal centre-like phenotype and distinct makeup from other lymphomas \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【23】Any skeletal bone can be involved; however, femur and humerus have been reported frequently \\[ 2 , 3 \\]; as it was the case in or patient. Similarly, patients with these tumors present with bone pain, palpable mass pathologic fracture or neurologic symptoms with spine involvement without B-symptoms \\[ 2–4 \\]. The histological diagnosis of bone lymphoma may be very problematic especially in resources limited settings undoubtedly related to the rarity of its presentation. In their study, Heyning _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\], on array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, they reported recurrent chromosomal alterations in primary diffuse large B cell lymphoma \\[ 8 \\]. The frequent radiological features include destructive lytic lesion with permeative margins associated with soft tissue mass \\[ 7 , 9 \\]. Differential diagnosis at the H&E level includes Ewing sarcoma and other SBRCT especially at the age of the current patient. However, it should be noted that Ewing sarcoma is very rare among patients with African ancestry probably as a result of genetic factors \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【24】Treatment of primary bone lymphoma may include a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while in contrast to nodal diffuse B-cell lymphoma the nuclear factor-kB does not seem to be an attractive therapeutic target \\[ 7 \\]. Surgery is indicated only when there is fracture \\[ 7 \\]. Prognosis of the disease is relatively good with a 5-year-survival > 80% when treated with chemo-radiotherapy \\[ 3 \\]. Factors associated with poor prognosis include advanced disease (>60 years) and site of mandible/maxilla \\[ 9 \\]. Our patient had poor outcome probably due to late presentation coupled with delayed treatment. Because of anxiety related to novel COVID-19 pandemic, the patient opted to stay at home postponing treatment. Delaying chemotherapy could lead to upstaging of the tumour while delaying palliative chemotherapy could lead to worsening of quality of life.\n\n【25】Primary bone lymphoma especially in African paediatric population is rare. Delay in diagnosis and treatment as it was the case in our patient is of concern when it comes to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease. Clinicians should have a suspicion of index for unusual cases and thus vigorously work-up including proper and timely diagnosis for optimal patient care.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】The authors would like to thank the parents of the patient for allowing us to use their son’s medical information for academic purposes.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------\n\n【29】The authors declared that no conflicting interests exist.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】None was received.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Agreement by the patient’s parents was obtained prior to submission of the manuscript and noted in patient’s chart.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】Dr. Alex Mremi is the guarantor of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Generally, these materials are non-toxic and inert. Nevertheless, a few cases of malignancy associated with certain implants have been documented in the literature. It has been reported that some components of these implants have carcinogenic properties. In most cases, these tumors are high-grade sarcomas that occur in the bone or soft tissue adjacent to the implant site. Here we present the case of a 53-year-old patient who underwent intramedullary nailing of the tibia and developed a pleomorphic sarcoma at the implant site 18 years later.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Prosthetic implants and metallic hardware are widely used in modern orthopedic surgery. They have significantly improved patient outcomes. These materials are relatively inert and non-toxic. Nevertheless, some of their constituents may have a neoplastic potential \\[ 1 \\]. Furthermore, the development of malignant tumors associated with certain implants is extremely rare. In the orthopedic literature, only a few cases have been documented \\[ 1–5 \\]. We hereby report the case of a 53-year-old patient who underwent intramedullary nailing of the tibia and developed pleomorphic sarcoma at the site of implant 18 years later.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 53-year-old man presented to our orthopedic department with two rapidly growing, ulcerated masses on the left leg. The patient reported that these masses had been developing for 2 months and were painless. He also reported a progressive weight loss of 5 kg and intermittent fever.\n\n【6】The patient’s medical history included a left tibial fracture surgically treated with intramedullary nailing 18 years ago. Upon physical examination, the first mass measured 10 cm in the anterior aspect of the upper leg, with no inflammatory signs opposite. However, the second mass measured 15 cm and was ulcerated with necrosis on the inferomedial aspect of the leg ( Fig. 1 ). The lymph node examination was uneventful.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Two ulcerated masses on the left leg.\n\n【10】Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left leg showed a nail intramedullary in the left tibia, and multiple osteolytic lesions, heterogeneous, poorly limited with permeative destruction of the cortical bone ( Fig. 2 ). The metallic implant is incompatible with magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, a biopsy of the first mass was taken, which revealed an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma ( Fig. 3 ). A bone scan was performed and showed increased tracer uptake only in the left tibia ( Fig. 4 ). A whole-body computed tomography scan revealed metastases in the lungs.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】The X-ray showed a nail intramedullary in the left tibia, and multiple osteolytic lesions, heterogeneous, poorly limited with permeative destruction of the cortical bone.\n\n【14】Figure 3\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Histological examination revealed an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\n【17】Figure 4\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Bone scan showed increased tracer uptake only in the left tibia.\n\n【20】Based on the past history, clinical, imaging and histologic findings, the diagnosis of high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with bone involvement in association with an implanted orthopedic hardware was retained. Consequently, our multidisciplinary team of orthopedists, oncologists and pathologists discussed the different treatment options and, after obtaining the patient’s consent, we opted for radical treatment (transfemoral amputation) and adjuvant chemotherapy for metastasis. After receiving the first dose of chemotherapy, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The follow-up was initially scheduled every 3 months for 1 year, then every year after that. At 6 months follow-up, the patient tolerated the prosthesis well and responded favorably to chemotherapy. Three years later, he is alive and there are no distant metastases and no local recurrences.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】The occurrence of malignancy associated with implanted orthopedic prosthesis or hardware is extremely rare. Until now, approximately 50 cases of sarcoma associated with orthopedic implants have been reported in the literature \\[ 4 \\]. As compared to the multitude of orthopedic procedures performed each year, this accounts a very small percentage of cases. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not yet clear, it has been reported in animal and human studies that some components of these implants, such as nickel, stainless steel, chromium, cobalt, iron, manganese, selenium, zinc and silicon have carcinogenic properties \\[ 1 , 6 \\]. In addition, other authors assume that implant-induced osteonecrosis contributes to malignancy development \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【23】Implant-associated sarcomas were seen in patients of widely varying ages 11–87 years, with a mean age of 50 years \\[ 1 \\]. There was no gender dominance. Usually, sarcomas develop between 6 months and 30 years following implant implantation, with a mean interval of 9 years \\[ 1 \\]. In our case, the interval was 18 years. These sarcomas generally occur around the implant site in the bone or soft tissue adjacent. In terms of location, the femur is the most commonly affected bone, followed by the tibia, pelvis and humerus. In these locations, implanted material is quite frequent, which can explain this distribution \\[ 5 \\]. Histopathology, these tumors are high-grade sarcomas including pleomorphic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, chondrosarcoma and synovial sarcoma. It seems that the type of sarcoma and the implanted material do not correlate \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【24】High-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a rare malignancy. It is usually seen in the 6th and 7th decades. About 75% of these tumors occur in the soft tissues of the extremities mainly in the lower limbs \\[ 8 \\]. Typically, patients present with an enlarged, painless mass. In 5% of cases, metastases are found at initial presentation as seen in our patient. The primary treatment for these sarcomas is surgical resection en bloc with a margin of normal tissue of 1–2 cm around the tumor \\[ 9 \\]. However, in some cases, particularly lower extremity sarcomas, amputation is preferred over difficult reconstruction. Moreover, prosthetic techniques have evolved significantly in recent years, resulting in improved tolerance and excellent performance \\[ 10 \\]. Radiotherapy can reduce the risk of local recurrences whereas chemotherapy is usually reserved for metastatic disease \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【25】Lastly, it is extremely rare for a malignant tumor to develop in association with an orthopedic implant. Nevertheless, physicians should be aware of this possibility, especially if new symptoms occur related to orthopedic implants.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【27】Nil.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【29】All authors declare that they don’t have a conflict of interest.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】Not applicable.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】The patient had given his written consent for publication.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】The guarantor is Dr Abdellatif Benabbouha.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A 60-year-old male presented with impaired consciousness and convulsions due to SAH from a ruptured aneurysm. It was managed by endovascular coiling 20 h after the onset of symptoms. Serial brain imaging for 2 weeks revealed progressive bilateral SHs, more on contralateral side of leaking aneurysm. Management of SH was discussed in a multidisciplinary setting to be conservative as there was neither significant mass effect nor hydrocephalus. The patient recovered neurologically except for mild dysarthria. The SH persisted for 2 months and then cleared gradually. We concluded that SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subdural space can be described as ‘subdural hygroma’ (SH), ‘external hydrocephalus’ and ‘subdural effusion’. SH represents a unique clinical entity \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【4】**Figure 1**\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Unenhanced CT scan at the time of presentation demonstrating diffuse SAH with the main brunt of hemorrhage in the left suprasellar cistern and Sylvian fissure.\n\n【7】**Figure 2**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Cerebral angiography during endovascular coiling revealed: ( **A** ) a 4.5 × 6 mm left posterior communicating aneurysm with neck 2–3 mm (the source of current bleeding).

( **E** ) At day 14, showing newly developed left small hygroma. ( **F** ) At day 30, showing the regressing right hygroma.\n\n【13】SH can complicate the course of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), particularly if there is a history of head trauma, CSF diversion techniques, or craniotomy and clipping of aneurysms. However, SH is rarely reported after endovascular coiling for ruptured aneurysms.\n\n【14】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【15】The patient was a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco smoking. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute onset of headache and mild right-sided weakness. The patient had neither history of head trauma nor fever before the presentation. Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) of brain revealed extensive SAH. CT cerebral angiography revealed a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCA), 4.5 × 6 mm with neck 2–3 mm, and another internal carotid artery, para-ophthalmic, unruptured aneurysm on the right side. Hunt and Hess’s scale was 3, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14/15. The patient developed generalized tonic–clonic convulsion that was controlled by midazolam and kept on oral levetiracetam.\n\n【16】Endovascular coiling was performed 20 h after the onset of symptoms, and it was an uncomplicated technique. ICU management followed the standard protocol of SAH \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【17】On the 5th day, GCS decreased to 11/15 and brain CT revealed the same degree of SAH and increased SH, but without any mass effect nor hydrocephalic changes. Transcranial Doppler to exclude cerebral vasospasm was requested but not done at that time due to technical problems.\n\n【18】No improvement was observed in the consciousness level, which deteriorated further. On the 10th day, GCS was 9/15 with worsened right-sided weakness (grade 2). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed right-sided sizable SH exerting mild mass effect and left basal ganglia ischemic focus. Multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) concluded that the patient had delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and significant SH with mild mass effect and recommended no intervention for SH.\n\n【19】At the end of the 2nd week, the consciousness level improved to GCS 11/15 and weakness was grade 3. Surprisingly, imaging revealed progressive right SH and new SH on the left side, but with no mass effect from either hygromas. Another MDM recommended continuing conservative management.\n\n【20】By the end of 1st month, the consciousness level was regained and right-sided weakness improved to grade 4 with mild dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed that SH had decreased. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center (RC) after 1 month of ICU stay.\n\n【21】Imaging after 2 months revealed that SAH was almost cleared, both SHs were still decreasing and a small left basal ganglia infarction. The patient was discharged home from RC without any residual weakness, fully conscious but with mild dysarthria.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】SAH is a serious medical condition with an increased fatality, an incidence of 9 per 100 000 and a fatality rate within 6 months of about 60%. In aneurysmal SAH, the three most important variables related to prognosis are the early neurological state, age and the degree of extravasation on imaging. Consciousness is the most important determinant for outcome after SAH \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【24】In 1932, Dandy described SH as a collection of nonblood fluid in the subdural space that can be encapsulated under a thin membrane \\[ 4 \\]. The pathogenesis of SH is still unclear; however, two postulated mechanisms include a tear in the arachnoid membrane causing CSF influx or decreased intracranial pressure leading to passive effusion \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【25】Both external hydrocephalus and SH have unique clinical entities. External hydrocephalus is usually associated with disturbances in CSF flow caused by the imbalance between production and absorption \\[ 7 \\]. Radiographically, external hydrocephalus and SHs are similar, but ventriculomegaly is the primary distinguishing criterion \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【26】Our case was managed by simple endovascular coiling through the femoral approach with the intervention of bleeding left PCA aneurysm (four coils were deployed), and the right one was postponed after complete patient recovery.\n\n【27】The serial imaging of our case never showed any ventriculomegaly during the course. This made it a unique case of SH post-coiling. A previous study reported a case of external hydrocephalus as it was associated with ventriculomegaly, which also complicated the course of coiling for ruptured aneurysm. However, the case remained asymptomatic and the collection resolved spontaneously \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【28】Subdural collections may be seen after clipping of ruptured aneurysmal SAH but rarely seen after coiling. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting alone is an effective and accepted procedure in post-clipping states. However, patients with subdural effusion that is not accompanied by hydrocephalus do not require subdural peritoneal shunt. When selecting the treatment for subdural effusion, it is important to consider the presence of hydrocephalus \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【29】The management strategies for cases of SH following aneurysmal SAH patients are still undefined. Close neurological observation is indicated to follow the progression of any mass effect or conversion into a subdural hematoma.\n\n【30】The management of our case regarding SH was challenging. The deteriorating consciousness level put more ambiguity on the clinical impact of SH due to the incidence of DCI at the same time of increasing size of SH and its mass effect. However, the absence of ventriculomegaly with a meticulous neurological assessment directed us to continue the conservative plan.\n\n【31】The etiology of the SH in the presented case is unknown as there was no history of head trauma at presentation, CSF diversion technique, nor craniotomy, which represent the potential causes for SH after SAH. Whether it is related to CSF flow dynamics post-occurrence of SAH or from a direct effect of coiling (although SH was mainly on the opposite side of bleeding aneurysm) is still to be defined.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【33】SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【34】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【35】None.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】Informed written consent was taken from a first-degree relative.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】W.O.A. and M.E.A.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Most tachyarrhythmias related with thyrotoxicosis include sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, but an association between thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis and typical atrial flutter has seldomly been documented. Here, we present the case of a young male who was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis causing cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, successfully treated with diltiazem, propranolol, methimazole, potassium iodine (SSK) and rivaroxaban.\n\n【2】atrial flutterthyrotoxic periodic paralysisGraves’ disease\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Periodic paralysis is a rare muscle disease that manifests by painless muscle weakness often precipitated by heavy exercise, fasting or high-carbohydrate meals. It is classified as either hyperkalemic or hypokalemic, with the hypokalemic form being most associated with thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation but has less frequently been reported to induce atrial flutter.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 38-year-old Caucasian male with a history of essential hypertension on amlodipine presented to the hospital complaining of recent onset intermittent lower extremity weakness and palpitations. On examination, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 180 bpm, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 rpm, and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 167/92 mmHg. Neurologic exam revealed paraparesis with lower extremity strength of muscle power assessment (MRC) score 3/5. Initial laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia at 1.7 mEq/L (normal 3.4–5 mEq/L), and the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response ( Fig. 1 ). He was initially treated with oral metoprolol tartrate and oral diltiazem, but subsequently required initiation of a diltiazem drip at a rate of 15 mg/h. Thyroid laboratory workup revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.008 mU/L (normal 0.35–5.0 mU/L), free T4 level > 8 ng/dL (normal 0.8–1.5 ng/dL) and total T3 of 5.23 ng/mL (normal 0.6–1.81 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) based on the thyroid panel results, hypokalemia and clinical presentation.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】12-lead ECG showed a rapid typical cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter and a rapid ventricular rate. Counterclockwise atrial flutter with flutter waves negative in II, III, aVF and positive waves in V1\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Mechanism of TTP\n\n【13】Based on these findings, propylthiouracil 200 mg every 4 h, prednisone 20 mg twice a day, and SSKI every 6 h were prescribed to manage the thyrotoxic state along with propranolol 160 mg every 8 h for additional reduction of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Moreover, therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was initiated regardless of a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points as the flutter was deemed to be induced by the thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【14】A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, revealing a normal left ventricle ejection fraction of 55% and no evidence of significant structural heart disease. Subsequent endocrine workup revealed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) elevated to 33.4 mU/L (normal 0.4–4.0 mU/L) consistent with the diagnosis of Graves’ disease (GD). Patient recovered normal neurological function with MRC 5/5 after 6 h of treatment initiation.\n\n【15】Therapeutic modalities that included radioactive iodine and surgery were discussed and deferred for the future. SSKI was discontinued after one week of treatment, and he was discharged and advised to continue methimazole for the following 12 months. He spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm 2 weeks after medical discharge without the need for electrical or pharmacological cardioversion after maintaining an adequate control of his hyperthyroidism.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Thyrotoxicosis is most associated with atrial fibrillation since thyroid hormone is known to have arrhythmogenic activity by acting on nuclear thyroid receptors and increasing sympathetic activity. Thyroid hormone upregulates the transcription of cardiac proteins, when acting on nuclear thyroid receptors. Thyroid hormones also exert an upregulating effect on the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to calcium release and a positive chronotropic/inotropic effect \\[ 1 \\]. Most cases relating thyrotoxicosis to tachyarrhythmias usually refer to atrial fibrillation, but sustained atrial flutter rarely occur in these scenarios.\n\n【18】GD, known as the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroidal and extrathyroidal manifestations. Graves’ is caused by the formation of activating thyrotropin-receptor antibodies that induce thyroid hormone overproduction. Exacerbation of GD may lead to thyroid storm, a potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency, as well as TPP \\[ 2 \\]. TPP is another severe but rare complication with a reported incidence of 0.2% in North America and seen more frequently in males and Asians. It is characterized by muscle paralysis, and acute hypokalemia due to a potassium shift into muscle cells ( Fig. 2 ). Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is the variant most seen in patients with GD in association with acute thyrotoxicosis, TTP is a sporadic form \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】The most common arrhythmias related to TPP and HPP are sinus tachycardia, and first-degree atrioventricular block. However, atrial flutter has not previously been illustrated along these clinical scenarios \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【20】When treating HPP, the goal is to address the symptoms caused by a hyperthyroid state and prevent recurrent attacks by controlling possible inducing factors. Despite the nomenclature, potassium reserves are normal in these patients. Supplementation is done to secure normal plasma levels of potassium. Intravenous potassium chloride is the first line of treatment for HPP \\[ 4 \\]. In cases that proved resistant to this intervention, intravenous propranolol effectively managed the paralytic symptoms. The effectiveness of propranolol can be attributed to its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase \\[ 5 \\]. Antithyroid drug management is widely considered as the gold standard of therapy; however, radioiodine ablation is more prevalent as first-line in North America. Nevertheless, the underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated. \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【21】Addressing the rhythm disorder can be divided into two steps \\[ 6 \\]. The first is managing rate control, which can be achieved using beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or amiodarone. The comorbidities should be considered when deciding on the agent to use. Propranolol has the advantage of reducing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 \\[ 5 \\]. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution since they affect peripheral resistance, and patients with thyrotoxicosis already present with a low systemic vascular resistance.\n\n【22】Amiodarone can be considered since it has a double advantage by reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis due to its high iodine content, and exerting its antiarrhythmic properties by blocking potassium rectifying currents leading to an increase in action potential duration and a prolonged effective refractory period of the AV node \\[ 7 \\]. The combination of properties can result in a more rapid resolution of symptoms in patients with arrhythmia secondary to thyrotoxicosis. On the other hand, amiodarone is rich in iodine and theoretically it may enhance thyrotoxicosis and type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more frequent in patients with underlying thyroid diseases such as GD \\[ 7 \\]. Thioamides should be given 1 h before SSKI or amiodarone. The second step to consider is preventing the arrhythmia’s maintenance, which can be achieved with the long-term use of the agents discussed above as prophylaxis for recurrent attacks. In this case, propranolol would be the agent of choice.\n\n【23】Lastly, we decided to use prophylactic anticoagulation regardless a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2− </sub> VASCs score of 0 points based on disagreement in the medical literature regarding the effectiveness of this strategy in patients with unknown duration of hyperthyroidism states, even more when transesophageal echocardiography is not pursued \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【24】GD may lead to potentially life-threatening emergencies, such as thyroid storm or TPP. Cardiac testing is indicated in patients with thyrotoxicosis. The underlying etiologies of hyperthyroidism should be investigated and treated accordingly. Propranolol is the beta-blocker of choice in cases of thyrotoxicosis. TPP can be a trigger for the development of sustained atrial flutter. In our case, appropriate treatment was associated with spontaneous resolution of the atrial flutter without the need for cardioversion or ablative intervention.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【26】The authors declare no relevant acknowledgment.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【28】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【29】FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OR FUNDING\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】This project was not supported by any grant or funding agencies.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】This is a case report, IRB was not required.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】Patient agreed with publication.\n\n【35】AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\n-------------------\n\n【36】All authors contributed to manuscript writing and approved the final version.

A case of giant coronary artery aneurysm with fistulous connection to the pulmonary artery: a case report and review of the literature. _Intern Med_ . 2012; 51:1361–6.). Multiple giant aneurysms involving all three coronary arteries are even rarer. We report a rare case of multiple giant aneurysms involving the right coronary, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries, supplemented with excellent multimodality imaging representations, i.e. plain radiograph, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography coronary angiogram.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Giant coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is defined as segmental vascular dilatation of a coronary artery beyond 20 mm in diameter \\[ 2 \\]. It is a rare condition. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and commonly the aneurysms are found incidentally.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 71-year-old gentleman was referred to our centre for further management of cardiomegaly which was noted on chest radiograph (Fig. 1 A). He was initially treated for pneumonia and following that he experienced reduction in effort tolerance for 2 weeks duration. He denied chest pain or other angina symptoms. Clinical examination was unremarkable with a non-displaced cardiac apex.\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Frontal chest radiograph ( **A** ) showing cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.6 without evidence of cardiac failure. The 2D-echocardiogram image ( **B** ) demonstrating non-dilated cardiac chambers with normal myocardial wall kinetic and circular cystic masses adjacent to the right (long arrow) and left atrial free walls (short arrow). The cystic masses did not demonstrate colour signal on colour Doppler echocardiogram ( **C** ).\n\n【9】Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no significant abnormality. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) revealed normal myocardial wall motion consistent with absence of regional or global myocardial ischaemia. However, incidental cystic masses were seen adjacent to the right and left atrial free walls (Fig. 1 B and C). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Fig. 2 A–C) and computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) (Fig. 2 D–F) demonstrated giant aneurysms with circumferential intramural thrombus of the right coronary (RCA) and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries; with saccular aneurysm of the proximal left circumflex (LCx) artery. On steady state free precision (SSFP) 4-chamber image of CMR, the round hypointense cross cut image of the giant RCA and LCx aneurysms appeared to resemble a mouse’s ears. Despite their sizes, the aneurysms did not cause compression to the adjacent cardiac chambers. There was no demonstrable late gadolinium enhancement in all coronary segments, which excluded evidence of myocardial infarction. Multiple dilated venous structures were noted on CTA at the region lateral to the aortic arch, in the aortopulmonary window and at the peritracheal regions likely to represent cavernous hemangioma.\n\n【10】Figure 2:\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Static images of cine SSFP 4-chamber MRI ( **A** ) showing hypointense masses with bright central signal, adjacent to the right and left atrial free walls—mimicking mouse ears—representing giant aneurysms of the RCA and LCx with circumferential hypointense intramural thrombi; short axis view at the level of aortic root ( **B** ) demonstrating C-shaped giant RCA aneurysm with significant luminal narrowing due to intramural thrombus and saccular aneurysm of the proximal LCx; short axis view at the basal left ventricle ( **C** ) showing cross cut of the giant LCx and LAD aneurysms. MPR CTA Coronary ( **D–F** ) confirmed the giant aneurysms of the RCA (long arrow), proximal LCx (short arrow), LAD (spiral arrow) and saccular LCx (short arrow) aneurysm.\n\n【13】The patient was treated medically with an antiplatelet drug. No active management was offered as the size of all three CAAs were extraordinarily large. At 1 year follow up, the patient remained stable, symptom-free and classified as class I New York Heart Association (NYHA). His coronary aneurysms were probably related to undiagnosed childhood Kawasaki disease or congenital in origin as all serology results were negative.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Giant coronary artery aneurysms are rare, with reported incidence of 0.02–0.2% \\[ 1 \\]. Multiple giant aneurysms involving all three coronary arteries are even rarer. CAA refers to vascular dilatation exceeding the normal diameter of the adjacent coronary segment or 1.5 times larger than the diameter of the largest coronary artery \\[ 2 \\]. When it is beyond 20 mm in diameter, it is called giant aneurysm \\[ 2 \\]. The most common aetiology of CAAs is atherosclerosis. Other causes include congenital, Kawasaki disease, trauma (including coronary angioplasty), Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, syphilitic aortitis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet disease and fibromuscular dysplasia \\[ 3 \\]. In our patient, the aetiology could be undiagnosed childhood Kawasaki disease or congenital, in view of presence of multiple thoracic cavernous hemangioma seen on CTA and negative serology investigations.\n\n【16】The majority of patients with CAA are asymptomatic. Other than short duration of reduced effort tolerance which was most likely due to his lung infection, our patient was symptom-free. Those who are symptomatic may present with symptoms of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden death, fistula formation, hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, compression of surrounding structures or even congestive heart failure \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【17】At present, there is no standard management guideline of CAA since the incidence is scarce. The choice of optimal therapy is still unknown and controversial. The available treatment options include medical therapy, percutaneous intervention (PCI) and surgical approach \\[ 4 \\]. The choice is tailored to the clinical situation of the particular patient. In asymptomatic patients, medical therapy with antiplatelet and/ or anticoagulant drugs are usually chosen to prevent thromboembolic complications. Surgical management is normally reserved for patients symptomatic of obstructive coronary artery disease or embolic phenomena which highly predispose to myocardial ischaemia \\[ 5 \\]. PCI using polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents has emerged as a newer option as it is easy to use \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【18】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【19】Giant CAA is a rare condition and it is even rarer when multiple coronary arteries are involved \\[ 1 \\]. The most common aetiology is atherosclerosis, followed by congenital and various connective tissue diseases \\[ 3 \\]. The majority of patients with coronary artery aneurysms are asymptomatic. The available treatment options include medical therapy, PCI and surgical approach \\[ 4 \\]. The choice of optimal therapy is still unknown and controversial.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】There is no conflict of interest to declare.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】No approval is required.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】Suzana Ab Hamid is the guarantor of this article.\n\n【32】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------\n\n【33】All the authors made substantial contribution to the preparation of this manuscript and approved the final version for submission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Herein, we detail his clinical presentation, management and highlight the role of CMR in viral myocarditis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The true prevalence of myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown \\[ 1 \\]. Since the beginning of the pandemic, few cases have been reported \\[ 2 \\]. These included those with mild disease to fulminant myocarditis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report from Sub-Saharan Africa of myocarditis diagnosed with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old male of Indian descent, with no known comorbidities except for a history of borderline obesity in the past presented with shortness of breath and chest discomfort post SARS-CoV-2 infection. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection about 3 weeks prior to this (mid-June 2020) presentation. He had returned to work following 2 weeks of isolation, but had difficulty coping due to exertional dyspnoea. Pulse oximetry demonstrated oxygen desaturation to 85%, particularly whilst wearing an N95 mask. His blood pressure (122/76 mmHg) and heart rate (76 beats/min) remained normal. There were no clinically relevant findings other than a body mass index of 25.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . He had poor effort tolerance on a 6-min walk test, managing a distance of only 120 m.\n\n【6】The following differential diagnoses were considered: pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and myocarditis. Chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal ( Figs 1 and 2 ). Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 4.80x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l (normal 3.92–10.4) with a normal differential count, C-reactive protein 5 mg/l (normal < 10 mg/l), ferritin 267 μg/l (normal 30–400 ug/l), D-dimer < 0.10 mg/l (0.0–0.25 mg/l) and NT-proBNP of 143 ng/l (normal < 300 ng/l). However, his high sensitivity Troponin T level was elevated at 319 ng/l (normal < 14 ng/l) and showed a steady rise to 490 ng/l. His transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) contractility and no regional wall motion abnormality or myocardial hypertrophy. There was no pericardial effusion. The pulmonary arteries were of normal size. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was normal ( Fig. 2 ). The coronary arteries were normal. Based on the clinical findings, rising troponin-T levels, and new T wave inversion in lead III on a repeat 12-lead ECG, a diagnosis of likely COVID-19-related viral myocarditis was made. Treatment with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily and prednisone 40 mg once daily were initiated whilst awaiting a CMR scan.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Normal baseline 12-lead ECG (top) and T wave inversion in lead III on follow-up visit (bottom).\n\n【10】**Figure 2**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Antero-posterior view of chest radiograph (left) showing normal lung fields and CT of the chest (right) confirming absence of parenchyma lung involvement.\n\n【13】The CMR scan confirmed normal LV and RV function and wall thickness with an LV ejection fraction of 65%, RV ejection fraction of 56% and wall thickness at end-diastole of 7 mm. There was delayed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) within the mid-wall as well as the epicardial regions involving the LV basal inferolateral wall, mid-anterolateral and mid- inferolateral wall ( Fig. 3A–D ). T2 short tau inversion recovery (STIR) black blood imaging showed high signal intensity within the LV anterolateral, inferolateral wall at the base and mid-ventricle level ( Fig. 3E ). On non-contrast T1 mapping, there was prolongation of T1 time at the mid-ventricle segment 5 (1212 ± 141 ms) and segment 6 (1113 ± 93.8 milliseconds) ( Fig. 3F ).

The exact pathophysiology still needs to be elucidated. Currently, it is postulated that it may be the result of a cytokine storm, notably Interleukin-6, or direct invasion of the myocardium by the virus \\[ 4 \\]. SARS-CoV-2 likely enters the myocardium by attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cell surface. Pathology findings in the myocardium have been variable and non-specific \\[ 1 , 5 \\].\n\n【30】Myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 can present in the absence of pneumonia, as in this case \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. From the published reports, the clinical presentation is varied, ranging from mild symptoms such as chest pain, fatiguability and palpitations to severe disease such as ventricular dysrhythmias, sudden cardiac death and pump failure. An elevated troponin level is suggestive of myocardial involvement and implies severe SARS-CoV-2 disease \\[ 6 \\]. However, a rise in troponin levels may be due to multiple factors in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The differentials include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or may merely reflect demand–supply mismatch in a critically ill patient. In these patients, additional imaging is useful to exclude myocarditis as a cause of elevated troponin levels. TTE is a useful first-line bedside investigation to assess regional or global LV dysfunction, pericardial effusion, LV hypertrophy and to exclude other causes of a troponin leak. However, CMR imaging has a higher sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of myocarditis \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. It is particularly useful in cases where echocardiography is normal and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) cannot be easily performed. Myocarditis typically involves the infero-postero-lateral wall at the base of the LV, but can be diffuse in nature \\[ 7 \\]. Myocardial oedema and LGE are characteristic features of myocarditis on CMR imaging \\[ 4 \\] as noted in the current case report. In recent reports of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis clinicians have not consistently made use CMR imaging or EMB for diagnosis of myocarditis \\[ 2 \\]. The underutilization of CMR imaging and EMB makes it challenging to differentiate primary myocarditis from secondary myocardial injury.\n\n【31】In general, the advocated management of viral myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 entails use of immunosuppression, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and cytokine blockade \\[ 1 , 4 \\] but recommendations have varied. In addition to heart failure therapy and supportive management, steroids with or without IL-6 inhibitors, and antiviral monotherapy without immunosuppression have all been used. Our patient had localized myocarditis with mild to moderate symptoms in the absence of heart failure or respiratory involvement and was treated with a combination of prednisone and colchicine due to its inhibition of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【32】This case highlights and reinforces the diagnostic utility of CMR and biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis.\n\n【33】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【34】None.\n\n【35】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【36】None.\n\n【37】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【38】Ethics approval was obtained from University of the Witwatersrand ethics committee (M200991).\n\n【39】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【40】Informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【41】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【42】Dr Ruchika Meel.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Due to possible rapid deterioration, as described in this case, we recommend immediate primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmias in these patients, and to take in consideration of the potential risks of using sodium valproate in these patients.\n\n【4】ARVC , cardiomyopathy , case report\n\n【5】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【6】Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is an inherited—in most of the cases—genetic heart muscle disorder characterized by arrhythmia and fibro-fatty changes in the heart wall, with estimated prevalence of 1:2500 to 1:5000 in both sporadic/familial cases, with male predominance.\n\n【7】The common genetic causes known to be associated with ARVC are DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, PKP2 and TMEM43. Less common genetic causes include CTNNA3, DES, LMNA, PLN, RYR2, TGFB3 and TTN. A subset of these 13 genes encode components of the desmosome in addition to the known genetic loci that have been associated with ARVC are 14q23-q24 (ARVC1), 1q42-q43 (ARVC2), 14q12-q22 (ARVC3), 2q32 (ARVC4), 3p25 (ARVC5), 10p12-p14 (ARVC6), 10q22, 6p24 (ARVC8) and 12p11 (ARVC9).\n\n【8】The main symptoms of ARVC are palpitations, syncope, atypical chest pain, dyspnea and right heart failure. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 of the population. ARVC is a disorder that is often diagnosed between the ages of 10 and 50 with a mean age of 30 \\[ 1–6 \\].\n\n【9】Here, we present a case of a young male who was first diagnosed with epilepsy and was treated accordingly. A diagnosis of ARVC was established, even though a family history was absent.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【11】A 12-year-old Syrian male was admitted to the pediatric emergency room with fatigue, dizziness and palpitation. A previous neurological examination led to the diagnosis of epilepsy as the child manifested recurrent seizures. Also, we performed EEG that revealed centro-parietal theta rhythmic activity with 2–3 hz generalized waves and spikes, which is a characteristic EEG pattern in infants and children with primary generalized seizures.\n\n【12】However, the child did not exhibit any particular subtype of epilepsy, and since the first incident of seizures, the child took sodium valproate daily with a dosage of 500 mg repeated twice.\n\n【13】On physical examination, the patient was responding well to the examiner. His blood pressure measurement was 90 over 60. His pulse was feeble and rapid. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sustained wide QRS tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia) that mimics a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology in the superior axis, that is, negative QRS in leads II, III and AVF, and positive in lead AVL. The patient was initially given Amiodarone with a loading dose of 5 mg/kg over 20 to 60 minutes repeated twice up to a maximum dose of 15 mg/kg. The patient did not respond well to the initial treatment. Synchronized direct-current (DC) was carried out, which successfully restored sinus rhythm.\n\n【14】Following hemodynamic stability, biochemical testing was performed. Complete blood count (CBC), K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cr and TSH values were normal. On the other hand, 12-lead resting ECG showed multiple abnormalities, including right bundle branch block (RBBB), T-wave inversion and Epsilon waves on precordial leads V1 up to V5. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed structural alteration of the right ventricle (RV) and blood stagnation. More specifically, the parasternal short-axis (PSAX) right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) value was 35 mm, along with regional dyskinesia of RV.\n\n【15】Afterward, the patient was discharged on Amiodarone and Bisoprolol, along with regular monitoring, which revealed progressive structural alteration of the right ventricle on TTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) on ECG ( Fig. 1 ) ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】ECG on presentation, showing sustained wide QRS tachycardia (VT) that mimic LBBB morphology in superior axis.\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】(A) 12 leads ECG after hemodynamic stability.

On physical examination, the patient’s systolic/diastolic blood pressure measurement was 80 to 60. ECG revealed rapid atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) ( Figs 3 and 4 ). TTE showed extreme enlargement of the right chambers along with significant tricuspid regurgitation. PSAX RVOT value was 53 mm. The patient was hospitalized. However, he rapidly succumbed to death due to severe right ventricular insufficiency. Postmortem myocardial biopsy was not performed because it was against the family wishes ( Figs 5 and 6 ).\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】ECG showing atrial fibrillation during follow-up.\n\n【26】**Figure 4**\n\n【27】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【28】Last hospitalization, ECG showing AF.\n\n【29】**Figure 5**\n\n【30】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【31】Last hospitalization, ECG showing AF with PVCs.\n\n【32】**Figure 6**\n\n【33】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【34】Echocardiography: (A) PSAX view, showing the extent of RV enlargement (PSAX RVOT = 35 mm).

(D) Apical view of the four chambers, showing tricuspid valve insufficiency.\n\n【35】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【36】ARVC is an inherited cardiomyopathy that affects a significant number of first-degree relatives of the proband. However, many patients with ARVC remain clinically silent and asymptomatic for decades, making the disease difficult to recognize, especially in sporadic cases with no documented familial involvement. Moreover, ARVC is characterized by a clinical presentation that includes documented arrhythmia and myocardial structural abnormalities. Meanwhile, the progression of the disease over time and predictors of arrhythmias are still to be defined.\n\n【37】Here, we report a sporadic case of ARVC in a 12-year-old boy who was previously diagnosed with epilepsy. However, there was no documented familial involvement. Very few cases in the literature mention mutations in apparently sporadic ARVC patients whose parents did not exhibit genetic mutations or cardiac manifestations \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. In our case and due to the ongoing crisis in Syria, neither the researchers nor the patient had access to genetic testing. Therefore, to screen the family, we were left with performing regular ECG and TTE on the parents and siblings, which showed normal findings.\n\n【38】The diagnostic process involved generating a differential diagnosis to rule out the common causes of palpitations. Blood tests revealed no signs of hyperthyroidism or ion disturbances, which could have caused palpitations. Moreover, the absence of infection and associated symptoms in lab findings and in child’s medical history ruled out myocarditis and Chagas disease. Furthermore, there was no evidence of extracardiac symptoms like lymphadenopathy, shortness of breath or dry, hacking cough and considering the rarity of childhood sarcoidosis, which is most frequently diagnosed between 20 and 29 years of age, we did not consider sarcoidosis as a potential cause. Also, the normal findings on chest X-ray and the absence of any signs of infection in the child or his family members made cardiac tuberculosis unlikely. However, we could not perform a cardiac biopsy as a confirmatory test due to both technical and financial reasons. Furthermore, postmortem myocardial biopsy was not performed as it was against the family’s wishes, which made the exclusion of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis ultimately impossible.\n\n【39】ECG findings ruled out Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and Brugada syndrome. Furthermore, characteristic ECG and TTE findings led us to consider a diagnosis of ARVC according to the modified Task Force Criteria \\[ 9 \\]. Correspondingly, the case presentation satisfied three major and one minor criteria. More specifically, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) mimicking LBBB morphology in superior axis, T-wave inversion that spanned the precordial leads, Epsilon waves on precordial leads and PSAX RVOT ≥32 to <36 mm along with RV dyskinesia on TTE were all recognized. Therefore, we decided on a diagnosis of ARVC.\n\n【40】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation was planned due to the progressive structural alteration of RV, as was reflected by TTE and ECG findings during follow-up. However, the rapid progression of the disease from the first onset of symptoms to severe right heart failure over the course of only one year, along with the surrounding circumstances in Syria imposed by the ongoing crisis, made an ICD implantation infeasible, for both financial and logistic reasons.\n\n【41】Finally, considering that cardiovascular side effects of sodium valproate are reported in 1–5% of the patients, which include hypertension, tachycardia and palpitations, we think that sodium valproate could have introduced potential risks in this patient \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【42】To our knowledge, this is a rare case of ARVC in which the condition manifested sporadically and was complicated by rapid progression, and unfortunate fatal deterioration, in a patient who was previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Thus, we recommend immediate primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmias in ARVC patients, and to take in consideration of the potential risks of using sodium valproate in these patients.\n\n【43】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【44】We would like to extend our sincere thanks to Dr. Abdullah Assani.\n\n【45】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【46】No conflict of interest.\n\n【47】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【48】There are no funding sources.\n\n【49】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【50】Not applicable.\n\n【51】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【52】Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the child for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Though her neuroimaging findings were atypical to those commonly found in CM, she was diagnosed with CM with a cryptococcal antigen test. However, in contrast to the good prognosis as stated in the literature, she died during her course stay at the hospital. Therefore, cryptococcosis should be taken as differentials, even in an immunocompetent individual presenting with features suggestive of meningitis, to prevent the worst clinical outcome.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a brain infection caused by the fungus Cryptococcus (either _Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii_ ). It is one of the most typical causes of meningitis in immunocompromised people, particularly those with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) \\[ 1 \\]. Although antiretroviral drugs reduce the prevalence of CM in HIV patients, the trend in an immunocompetent host is assumed to rise over the years \\[ 2 \\]. Annually, there are 223 100 cases of CM worldwide with the largest burden in sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asian regions \\[ 1 , 3 \\].\n\n【4】Common meningeal symptoms, such as headache and neck stiffness, are usually present in classic CM. However, other systemic signs of disseminated illness, such as pneumonia and dermatological symptoms, may also be present \\[ 1 \\]. Therefore, evaluation of immunocompetent patients with subacute to chronic meningitis for _C. neoformans_ is needed. Even though serum cryptococcal antigen and radiographic imaging help identify CM, lumbar puncture is necessary for a conclusive diagnosis \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. The lumbar puncture with elevated opening pressure, predominantly mononuclear cells, demonstration of encapsulated yeast with India ink and positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture of the organism are typical findings confirming the diagnosis \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【5】The examination for CM is infrequently performed in low-income countries like Nepal among immunocompetent individuals who exhibit meningitis-like symptoms since the diagnosis is frequently overlooked. Unfortunately, such an immunocompetent patient with CM carries a higher mortality rate than those with an immunosuppressed state \\[ 5 \\]. We present a case of a 29-year-old immunocompetent female who experienced chronic blurred vision, headaches and vomiting for 3 months before being diagnosed with CM.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 29-year-old married female presented to our center with complaints of intermittent headaches followed by vomiting for the last 3 months. Each episode of headache was acute in onset, located in the parieto-occipital region, moderate in intensity and associated with vomiting most of the time. The pain was slightly relieved with analgesics from the local pharmacy. But, for the last 20 days, the patient reported an increase in the frequency and severity of headaches and multiple vomiting episodes. She also had a fever but the temperature was not recorded. There was no history of trauma, chronic intake of medications, loss of consciousness, abnormal body movements and recent change in behaviors. There was no significant medical or surgical history suggestive of immunodeficiency. She was a reformed smoker and occasionally consumed alcohol.\n\n【8】At presentation, the patient was conscious and well oriented to time, place and person with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 out of 15. The sensory, motor, cranial nerve and cerebellar examination did not reveal any abnormal findings. The meningeal signs like neck stiffness and Kernig’s sign were absent. Direct ophthalmoscopic examination showed no evidence of optic disk swelling or papilledema. Vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure: 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute and temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) except for tachycardia (110 bpm). The systemic examination was unremarkable. Baseline investigations were within the reference range. The serum glucose measured was 90 mg/dl. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.\n\n【9】The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ring-like lesion in the left lentiform nucleus with an eccentric nodule and surrounding edema. These features were suggestive of neurocysticercosis (colloidal vesicular stage; Fig. 1 ). Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done on the next day which revealed normal white cell count (less than five cells), high protein (50 mg/dl; 15–45 mg/dl), low glucose (30 mg/dl; 50–80 mg/dl) and normal adenosine deaminase (8 U/L; < 10 U/L) levels. The opening pressure was 12 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O. Gram staining showed multiple budding yeast cells resembling _Cryptococcus_ sp. Likewise, India ink preparation of the CSF sample showed a capsule structure resembling _C. neoformans_ ( Fig. 2 ). The diagnosis of CM was made a week after the admission. A part of the sample was sent outside for a cryptococcal antigen test as it was not available in our center.\n\n【10】Figure 1\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】MRI of head.

Parenteral amphotericin B (liposomal; 3 mg/kg/day) was started for CM. Likewise, oral fluconazole (800 mg per day) was also administered as flucytosine was not available in our setting. Therapeutic CSF drainage was planned in case of persistent headache and/or vomiting. Other supportive treatment measures including chest physiotherapy and mobilization were provided. The following day of ICU admission, she developed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, which was managed conservatively. She developed hypotension (90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (112 bpm) and tachypnea (26 breaths per minute). The serum lactate level was elevated (4.5 mmol/L), and the diagnosis of septic shock was made. Noradrenaline (10 mcg/min) was started for the same. Parenteral meropenem (1 g every 8 h) was added for worsening oxygenation with the differential diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50–55%, severe tricuspid regurgitation with estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg and severely dilated right cardiac chambers. Therefore, furosemide (80 mg IV) was administered for volume overload.\n\n【17】In the meantime, the antigen test for _Cryptococcus_ came back positive. The septic shock resolved gradually, and the noradrenaline infusion was stopped. Therapeutic lumbar puncture was done for 2 days and 23 mL of CSF was removed as the opening pressure was high (>35 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O; 10–20 cm of H <sub>2 </sub> O). The rest of the intensive care and monitoring was continued. But, after 2 days of slight improvement (clinically), the condition of the patient suddenly deteriorated, and ultimately, she passed away on the 7th day of her ICU stay. The actual cause of the death could not be determined as the postmortem examination was not conducted.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】In contrast to Cryptococcosis that is considered a classical disease with certain underlying diseases pathology or predisposing factors, cryptococcosis in phenotypically normal individuals is on the rise \\[ 5 \\]. The global burden of CM in the immunocompromised population, particularly in the HIV-AIDS population, has been extended with an estimated prevalence of 6.0% \\[ 6 \\]. A comprehensive report from 2015 estimates the total burden of CM (in HIV/AIDS and immunocompromised patients) to be 164 (0.6 per 100 000) in Nepal \\[ 7 \\]. The occurrence of CM in immunocompetent individuals (non-HIV and non-transplant patients) has been increasing steadily with most centers reporting up to 20% of cases in the non-immunocompromised population \\[ 5 \\]. According to a study by Hevey _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\], the 90-day mortality was higher in immunocompetent groups (41.1%) as compared with immunocompromised groups (15.2% in HIV and 12.2% in transplant groups).\n\n【20】Two fungi are implicated in invasive cryptococcosis, _C. neoformans_ and _C. gatti_ , both encapsulated yeasts. However, _C. neoformans_ has been associated with the immunocompromised host in contrast to _C. gatti_ , which is shown to occur with immunocompetent hosts \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. Cryptococcus species have a propensity for the central nervous system, particularly in immunocompromised patients, because of their multiple virulence factors. However, CM in immunocompetent patients is difficult to explain. The possible explanations could be because of exposure to cryptococcal strain with high pathogenicity, high level of pathogen exposure, or subtle or undetectable immune deficits. Such deficits could be because of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus or autoimmune conditions \\[ 8 \\]. Our case did not have any of those subtle causes for immune deficits, because of which we labeled our case as apparently immunocompetent.\n\n【21】The Cryptococcus species, in immunocompetent individuals, have more propensity for developing pulmonary cryptococcosis than in immunocompromised individuals. Similarly, the neuroimaging findings are more localized and include hydrocephalus in immunocompetent patients \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. The clinical picture of CM in immunocompetent patients tends to have typical features including fever, stiff neck, headache, vomiting or altered mental status in contrast to immunocompromised individuals, who have only subtle clinical features \\[ 8 \\]. Regarding our case, she had neurological involvement with fever and vomiting as the initial presentation and later neurological deterioration. The neuroimaging findings did not show hydrocephalus, instead had a ring-enhancing lesion resembling findings of the colloidal vesicular stage of neurocysticercosis. However, there can be findings in imaging like cerebral infarction, granulomas and pseudocysts \\[ 5 , 8 \\].\n\n【22】As for Nepal, in two case reports of CM in immunocompetent patients, both had apparently immunocompetent patients without any subtle immune deficits. And with the appropriate treatment as per recommended guidelines \\[ 1 , 8 \\], both had good prognoses \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. However, it was quite the opposite regarding our patient, who died during the course of treatment in the ICU of our center. This could be possibly because of neurological deterioration secondary to raised intracranial pressure. There is conflicting evidence on the prognosis of CM in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with some favoring immunocompetent individuals \\[ 5 , 9 , 10 \\]. However, mortality can also be pertinent in immunocompetent individuals because of the unavailability of investigative tools, frequent overlooking of the diagnosis and delayed presentation.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】Hence, cryptococcosis should be considered despite an apparent immunocompetent individual without any known comorbid conditions presenting with features suggestive of meningitis.

In this study, we presented a case showing signs of an acute abdomen with sharp rises in serum pancreatic biochemical markers during the treatment of DKA with pyelonephritis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed to confirm the onset of acute pancreatitis; however, pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement of the rectal wall were detected, indicating the presence of rectal infarction. Hartmann’s procedure was immediately performed, and histological examination of the resected specimen revealed gangrenous ischaemic colitis. The present case highlights DKA as a risk factor of ischaemic colitis and the role of contrast-enhanced CT in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Ischaemic colitis occurs when there is a transient or sustained compromise in blood flow that fails to meet the metabolic needs of the colon \\[ 1 \\]. This leads to mucosal ulceration, inflammation, haemorrhage and eventually bowel infarction \\[ 1 \\]. Different types of ischaemic colitis, including transient colitis, chronic ulcerative colitis with or without stricture, and gangrenous colitis, are differentiated based on their clinical course and severity \\[ 2 \\]. Gangrenous colitis has a high mortality rate of up to 40% and requires urgent surgical intervention \\[ 1 \\]. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) plays a critical role in the development of ischaemic colitis due to mesenteric collapse as it results in a serious reduction of fluid volume \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. We herein describe a patient with gangrenous ischaemic colitis who presented with an acute abdomen during an episode of DKA that was difficult to differentially diagnose from acute pancreatitis, which is also a common comorbidity of DKA \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man who had been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidaemia and spinocerebellar degeneration with orthostatic dysregulation, dysarthria, neurogenic bladder and faecal incontinence at a local clinic was referred to our department for inadequate glycaemic control with impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale E2V1M4). On admission to the emergency room, he had a body temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure of 84/56 mm Hg, pulse of 104 bpm and respiration rate of 24 breaths/min. Physical examination showed clear lungs and no cardiac murmurs on chest auscultation, non-palpable liver and spleen, decreased bowel sounds, no abdominal distension, mass or bruit, and no oedema in the extremities. Laboratory examination showed high levels of fasting plasma glucose (1500 mg/dl) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 10.6%). DKA was diagnosed based on the detection of metabolic acidaemia (pH 7.209) with an increased anion gap (27.7 mEq/L) due to high serum ketone levels (4.04 mmol/L). Urinalysis revealed that the urine was macroscopically cloudy, and urinary occult blood, ketone, and sugar were strongly positive. Leukocytosis (27.1 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with predominant neutrophils (92.0%), high serum C-reactive protein levels (4.54 mg/dl), and pyuria with leukocytes ≥10/high power field in the urinary sediment were suggestive of concomitant pyelonephritis. Biochemistry analysis indicated a marked increase in serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (139.2 mg/dL), creatinine (5.10 mg/dL), potassium (7.7 mEq/L), creatinine kinase (CK 3480 IU/L) with predominant CK-MM isozyme (BB 0%, MB 2%, MM 98%), and myoglobin levels (10 899 IU/L) representing renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities and rhabdomyolysis. The electrocardiogram reflected the patient’s hyperkalaemic status with a marked high-peaked T wave in leads V <sub>2–4 </sub> and wide QRS complexes in all leads. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) analysis on arrival revealed no significant findings in the head, chest, abdomen or intrapelvis ( Fig. 1A and B ).\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Computed tomography of the intrapelvis showed no apparent abnormalities on admission (A and B), but revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement in the rectal wall on Day 2 of hospitalization (C and D, _arrow_ ).\n\n【9】Treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of isotonic saline (0.9% saline solution) and regular insulin was initiated after the diagnosis of DKA, but haemodialysis was not performed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was also intravenously administered after blood and urine cultures were obtained. Streptococcus species were detected with a bacterial count of ≥10 <sup>5 </sup> colony-forming units/ml in the urine culture test. Streptococcus, a weak pathogen, accounts for only 1–2% of causative bacteria of urinary tract infections. However, the patient had poorly controlled DM and neurogenic bladder, which could have contributed to the development of streptococcal-related pyelonephritis \\[ 5 \\]. The results of multiple blood cultures were negative for bacteraemia. For DKA, plasma glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in capillary blood were corrected to 378 mg/dl and 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, 18 hours after the initiation of treatment. Serum potassium levels were dropped to 5.7 mEq/L, which almost normalized the electrocardiogram findings at that time. However, the treatment failed to ameliorate renal failure as serum BUN and creatinine remained high, i.e. 128.3 mg/dl and 5.22 mg/dl, respectively. Impaired consciousness and haemodynamic instability continued, and diffuse distension and rigidity of the abdomen were newly observed. Intestinal peristalsis remained diminished, and no melena was observed. Serum pancreatic biochemical markers that were normal at the time of admission (amylase 98 IU/L) rose remarkably (amylase 1026 IU/L, pancreatic type amylase 1013 IU/L, and lipase 1201 IU/L). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed to elucidate coexisting acute pancreatitis, which revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poorly enhanced bowel walls of the rectum ( Fig. 1C and D ), but no evidence of severe pancreatitis was found. There were no mesenteric artery and venous occlusion due to emboli and thrombosis.\n\n【10】The patient underwent Hartmann’s procedure, including segmental resection of the rectum and sigmoid colostomy formation. The resected rectum was clearly demarcated from the non-necrotic area and the necrotic mucosa was a circumferential lesion ( Fig. 2A ). Histological examination of the specimen revealed typical findings of gangrenous ischaemic colitis, such as coagulative mucosal necrosis, submucosal haemorrhage and necrotising muscle layer infiltrated with numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils ( Fig. 2B–E ). The patient recovered uneventfully after surgery and subsequent rehabilitation practices, and he has then maintained proper glycaemic control (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 5.9–6.3%) with oral glucose-lowering agents and normal renal function for 2 years after being discharged.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】(A) Gross appearance of the resected specimen revealed an entire circumferential necrotic lesion of the rectal mucosa. The lesion had a relatively clear border and several linear and map-like mucosal ulcerations in the non-necrotic region. Histopathological examination of the resected rectum revealed (B) a lesion with clear demarcation from the area of unaltered crypt architecture, and (C) sloughing of the epithelium with loss of ductal epithelial cells (ghost-like appearance) (see yellow square in Fig. 2A ). The examination also revealed (D) mucosal coagulative necrosis and submucosal haemorrhage, and (E) necrotising muscle layer infiltrated with numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils (see red square in Fig. 2A ). Haematoxylin and eosin staining: original magnification: (B) ×40, (C)×100, (D)×20 and (E)×400.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Six risk factors including hypoalbuminaemia (<3.5 g/dl), older age (≥60 years), haemodialysis, hypertension, DM and use of constipation-inducing medication are associated with the development of ischaemic colitis \\[ 2 \\]. Of these, the patient had four risk factors: older age (61 years), hypoalbuminaemia (2.9 g/dl) and a history of hypertension and T2DM. His abnormal bowel habits including recurrent constipation and diarrhoea due to spinocerebellar degeneration might have increased the visceral intraluminal pressure, leading to worsened bowel wall ischaemia.\n\n【16】The CK isozyme CK-BB is found in the mucosa and muscularis throughout the gastrointestinal tract \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. After intestinal infarction, serum CK-BB levels immediately rise, peak at 6 hours, and rapidly drop within 24 hours, even in the presence of progressive irreversible bowel infarction \\[ 6 \\]. In this case, serum CK-BB isozyme was not detected at the time of admission; therefore, bowel infarction was likely to be initiated after hospitalization. Clinically, ischaemic colitis frequently occurs in the descending and sigmoid colon rather than in the rectum as the three arteries (right and left iliac arteries, and the superior rectal artery) supply blood to the rectum. This characteristic rectal circulation might have contributed to the slow progression of ischaemic colitis before the intestine became gangrenous during his hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【17】Acute pancreatitis occurs in 11% of adults with DKA, whereas non-specific elevations in serum amylase and lipase levels are observed in 40% of DKA patients \\[ 4 , 8 \\]. High serum amylase levels are also associated with bowel infarction, and the magnitude of hyperamylasaemia is related to the degree of infarction \\[ 9 \\]. Therefore, bowel infarction and acute pancreatitis may show similar clinical picture, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the two based solely on pancreatic biochemical marker values \\[ 9 \\]. This case supports the finding that contrast-enhanced CT imaging should be considered in DKA patients to exclude acute pancreatitis when serum amylase levels rise more than three times the normal upper limits \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【18】In conclusion, clinical course and laboratory findings in DKA patients may be non-specific to distinguish severe ischaemic colitis from other intra-abdominal diseases, including acute pancreatitis. Evaluation of contrast-enhanced CT imaging may provide useful information for prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of intestinal ischaemia in order to achieve a favourable outcome.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【20】The authors thank Dr Yuichi Kataoka (Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan) for his collaboration.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【22】None declared.\n\n【23】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【24】The present case report meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【25】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.\n\n【27】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【28】Hiroaki Iwasaki.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis was made through serially abdominal X-rays and abdominal ultrasound.\n\n【3】ingested foreign bodies , appendectomy , sharp metallic foreign , abdominal X-rays\n\n【4】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【5】Foreign bodies’ (FBs) ingestion is a very common worldwide health problem in children between 6 months and 3 years of age \\[ 1 \\]. FBs generally do not cause complications and pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously \\[ 2 \\]. Less than 0.0005% of them get trapped in the appendix and require surgical management \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【6】In the asymptomatic patient, a series of abdominal X-ray is recommended following up on the progress of the foreign body. When a foreign body becomes immobile at a distal bowel, a high suspicion of a foreign body trapped in the appendix must be considered, and a prophylactic appendectomy is recommended with or without a sign of inflammation \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 13-year-old Syrian female was presented to the emergency department for evaluation after accidentally swallowing a foreign body (a pin). In her medical history, the girl was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 8 years before by MEFV mutation. The patient’s symptoms were controlled by colchicine (0.07 mg/kg/day) with the last attack a year ago. Upon physical examination, the patient was alert, without distress, and all her vital signs were within the normal average. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-distended, non-tender abdomen. The abdominal radiography showed a radiopaque foreign body in the right lower quadrant ( Fig. 1 ). As the physical exam was normal and the foreign body was not causing obstruction, it was predicted that it will pass through spontaneously without any complications and the patient was discharged with instructions for getting abdominal X-rays as an outer patient for follow-up. A week later the patient had episodes of colicky abdominal pain around the umbilicus without any other symptoms. There were not any remarkable signs in the abdominal examination except for a mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There was no palpable mass, and the bowel sounds were normal.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant.\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Highly echogenic, linear metallic foreign body.\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】(a) An appendix with trapped pin. (b) The trapped pin.\n\n【18】Laboratory investigations were within the normal range. The white blood cell count was 8500 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> , differential count polymorphs 45%, lymphocytes 50% and platelets (PLT) 450 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen were normal. Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant, which was in the same location that the prior abdominal radiography showed. An abdominal ultrasound scan was requested which revealed highly echogenic, the linear metallic foreign body within a slightly swollen appendix ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【19】Because the pin was trapped in the appendix with difficultly to pass through and to avoid further complications such as inflammation or perforation, the patient was taken up for surgery. During surgery a sharp pin was found to be trapped in the appendix with no signs of inflammation or perforation. The procedure completed as prophylactic appendectomy ( Fig. 3a and b ).\n\n【20】The patient was discharged the next day after surgery, with no postoperative complications.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Most of the FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously within a week and do not cause any complications \\[ 5 \\]. In rare cases, the foreign body tends to be trapped in the appendix which is attributable to an inferior anatomical location, angulation or narrowing and remains stagnant as a result of the inability to return it to a normal pathway \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【23】Rare cases in which a foreign body in the appendix has not generated inflammation have been described in the literature. The first reported appendectomy was in 1735 by Amyand, a London surgeon who removed an appendix perforated by a pin from an 11-year-old \\[ 6 \\]. More than 250 cases of appendiceal foreign bodies have been described \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】Clinical signs of FBs depend on their size, shape and location \\[ 1 \\]. Some cases may be asymptomatic, while others if the object is thin, sharp or metallic up to 93% of the patients may experience symptoms like abdominal pain and low-grade fever, with or without vomiting \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【25】In the asymptomatic patient, a serial of abdominal X-ray is recommended following up on the progress of the foreign body. When the foreign body remains in the right lower quadrant in serial abdominal X-ray, an appendicular foreign body should be highly suspected \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【26】Although FBs in the appendix are rare, different kinds of foreign bodies have been reported to be trapped in the appendix, and most of them are found to be radiopaque.\n\n【27】An appendicular foreign body can be classified into high-risk and low-risk depending on the ingested object. High-risk FBs are found in 75% of the cases and include sharp, long or pointed, while low-risk are found in 12% of the cases and include blunt, round objects \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. The appendicular foreign body carries a risk of developing appendicitis, peritonitis, perforation, hemorrhage or an abscess formation \\[ 1 \\]. Due to this, an appendectomy is performed with or without any sign of inflammation \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【28】In our case, the patient had a history and diagnosis of FMF. She came with episodes of colicky abdominal pain without any clinical or laboratory signs of FMF attack. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound appeared linear metallic foreign body trapped in the appendix. The determination of surgical intervention was based on ultrasound, which revealed the foreign body in the lumen of the appendix regardless of physical examination to avoid complications in the upcoming future, and a prophylactic appendectomy was done.\n\n【29】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【30】We wish to thank the medical officer and doctors in pediatric and pediatric surgery departments for the consent for publication and the laboratory assistants in Tishreen Hospital Laboratory.\n\n【31】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【32】None declared.\n\n【33】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【34】No funding was obtained for this study.\n\n【35】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【36】This case report did not require review by the ethics committee of Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.\n\n【37】WRITTEN INFORMED\n----------------\n\n【38】Consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Correspondingly, heart transplant recipients are a vulnerable population for which insufficient research has been conducted. Pathologic antibody-mediated rejection (pAMR) of cardiac allografts shares many characteristics with COVID-19-associated cardiac injury. In this case study, we investigate a 57-year-old female who contracted COVID-19 11 days postheart transplant and was observed to have pAMR while positive for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, resulting in a diagnostic conundrum.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, heart transplant (HT) recipients have been faced with innumerable challenges including infection susceptibility, disease exacerbation and treatment. HT recipients have been found to have a 2-fold higher death rate and infection rate for COVID-19 when compared to the general population \\[ 1 \\]. Despite current evidence providing an overview of the clinical characteristics of HT patients with COVID-19, there is a gap in pathological research regarding the specific mechanisms of viral infection in these patients. This report follows the unique case of a 57-year-old female who contracted COVID-19 11 days post-HT and developed concurrent pathological antibody-mediated rejection (pAMR). Further investigations have shown the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated cardiac injury presenting similarly to antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), resulting in a diagnostic conundrum.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted multiple times to the hospital for heart failure and cardiogenic shock in 2020. In July 2020, an echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 11%. The patient was known for atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, transient ischemic attack and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was an ex-smoker of 30-pack-years who quit 6 months prior to transplant. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease, with her father and grandfather having experienced myocardial infarctions in their 60s.\n\n【6】In December 2020, the patient received a HT. On 6 January 2021 (11 days later), she tested positive for COVID-19 due to an in-hospital outbreak. A week following, she developed increased oxygen requirements and a right-sided pleural effusion on chest computed tomography (CT). Although the patient noted shortness of breath when lying flat or with movement, she was not in acute respiratory distress and was hemodynamically stable with normal heart function on echocardiography. Despite initially being diagnosed with pAMR of the cardiac allograft ( Fig. 1 ), subsequent investigations have suggested a potential presentation of COVID-19 infection resembling pAMR in the heart of this patient ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Immunohistochemical staining of patient biopsies.

Pathologic antibody-mediated rejection (pAMR) shows distended capillary-sized blood vessels with intravascular macrophages and reactive endothelial cells as shown in these representative H&E photomicrographs (original magnification, 600×).\n\n【13】Prior to transplantation, the patient had 0.1% HLA I and 63.2% HLA II. At the time of transplant, the patient had a moderate (mean fluorescence intensity = 4149) DSA to HLA DPB1\\*04:01 detected. The B-cell flow cross-match was reported to be negative; although the B-cell shift was below the threshold level of 80, the shift toward the positive cutoff was consistent with the moderate donor-specific antibody to DP0401. Immunohistochemistry detected positive staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the explanted recipient heart tissue despite a negative nasopharyngeal swab test. Following cardiac transplant, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on 4 January 2021, and positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 6 January. The patient’s 4 January post-transplant biopsy showed no acute cellular rejection (grade 0R) and immunohistochemical evidence of pAMR1(I+). An echocardiogram revealed improving cardiac function from the time of transplant.\n\n【14】After her COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient became increasingly hypoxemic but was otherwise hemodynamically stable with normal heart function by echocardiogram. The patient was prescribed dexamethasone from 10–23 January for COVID-19. The pAMR in her cardiac allograft appeared to become more persistent as her hospital stay progressed. On 20 January and 27 January, cardiac allograft biopsies showed pAMR2, which slowly resolved until the patient was discharged on 26 February. Given her stability on echocardiogram, she was not treated for pAMR. Compared to the CT-chest on 12 January, which showed a ground-glass lung phenotype consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, the 26 January CT-chest demonstrated marked recovery. The patient tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 on 7 February, via nasopharyngeal swab. The reports of transplant rejection were congruent with COVID-19 positivity and diminished with viral clearance.\n\n【15】At discharge, she was taking multiple medications, including tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate, acetylsalicylic acid and pravastatin. Neither intubation nor mechanical ventilation was required throughout her hospital stay. At the time of her 10 March biopsy, she had no evidence of pAMR.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Allograft rejection is responsible of 10% of deaths within the initial 3 years after transplant \\[ 2 \\], and COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury have a 51.2% increase in-hospital mortality compared to those without \\[ 3 \\]. Although there are no current studies on the combination of pAMR and COVID-19, it is hypothesized that worse outcomes will be documented, warranting further investigation.\n\n【18】PAMR is typically treated with the goal to stop immune-mediated injury and supporting cardiac failure \\[ 4 \\]. Although there is no current diagnostic consensus, corticosteroids and intravenous gamma globulin have widely been reported as therapeutics \\[ 4 \\]. For severe COVID-19 manifestations, antivirals, anticoagulation and immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK 1,2 inhibitors) are often prescribed \\[ 5 \\]. Corticosteroids contribute to T-cell and B-cell suppression though the specific effects of dexamethasone on pAMR remain to be elucidated \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【19】The criteria for pAMR2 requires histological (capillary endothelial swelling and macrophages within capillaries) and immunopathologic (C4d) findings \\[ 4 \\]. Correspondingly, these indicators are also characteristic of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury.\n\n【20】Although C4d is a marker of pAMR, research also implicates this protein as a hallmark of COVID-19-mediated infection. Deposits of C4d have been found in the heart, lung, brain, skin and liver tissue which is compatible with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RNA localization and ACE2 receptor presence in severe COVID-19 patients \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Control patients had no deposits, while all COVID-19 tissue examined were positive for C4d <sup>7 </sup> .\n\n【21】Macrophages, characterized by CD68 expression and a vital component in AMR diagnosis, have been found to play a prominent role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Previous reports have described it as a useful tool in high risk patients in need of intravascular material resection. Here we present a unique and never reported case of AngioVac device thrombectomy use in a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and gastrointestinal bleed that contraindicated other thrombectomy therapies due to severe anemia and high bleeding risk. A brief literature review about this therapy and its main outcomes is presented to contextualize the reader and contribute to academic knowledge.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Right heart masses are considered a life-threatening condition due to a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Masses found to be thrombi are rare and have various etiologies such as thrombosed central veins or central venous catheter-associated masses \\[ 1 \\]. Non-thrombotic causes are usually related to metastatic lesions from tumors of the liver, lungs, mediastinum and melanoma \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】**Figure 1**\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Admission electrocardiogram.\n\n【7】Diagnosis is based on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), however its sensibility and specificity for differentiating between clots, myxomas, fibromas and fatty tissue is limited, hence, additional imaging is usually required, such as contrast perfusion transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or TEE. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan have similar sensitivity but greater specificity compared to TTE at defining the etiology of the cardiac mass and may be useful for differentiating between malignant, vascular and stromal tumors from thrombi \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【8】Once the diagnosis is made, treatment is rapidly targeted with different therapies as pharmacological thrombolysis, surgical mechanical thrombectomy and mechanical catheter-directed therapies as the AngioVac device. Choosing among these methods is still debated, retrospective studies have shown that patients with PE and free floating intra-cardiac thrombus benefit from surgical thrombectomy as opposed to thrombolysis alone. In those cases where surgery is contraindicated, thrombolytic therapy alone is an option if there is not a high bleeding or distal embolization risk \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【9】Patients who are not eligible for those therapies or have a large clot burden are candidates for catheter thrombectomy with AngioVAC device, a novel promising therapy but with little available published experience and evidence. Here we present the case of a patient with right atrial catheter-associated thrombus and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) treated with AngioVac device. A brief literature review has been included for knowledge contribution to the reader.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【11】A 29-year-old Guatemalan male with significant past medical history of end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis, hypertension and 5 years use of indwelling tunneled central venous catheter presented to the emergency room due to a 5-day clinical onset of black stools and 1 day of acute moderate chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath at rest and dizziness. Vital signs were only remarkable for a blood pressure of 182/103 mmHg. At physical examination head, neck, lungs, heart and abdomen were normal. No blood per rectum or melena was found. Bilateral 2+ lower extremity pitting edema was noted.\n\n【12】Laboratory reports showed positive Troponin-I consecutive results of 4.58—4.56—4.19 ng/L and severe acute anemia with Hemoglobin (HgB) of 5.4 g/dl, EKG showed sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, left anterior fascicular block, poor R wave progression and no ST-segment changes (see Fig. 1 ). TTE was ordered. Blood cultures were positive for _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ . The patient’s chart showed last HgB level of 10.4 g/l 15 days before in prior admission.\n\n【13】**Figure 2**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Apical four-chamber view showing thrombus in right atrium (arrow) with mobile element (asterisk).\n\n【16】Patient was diagnosed with acute UGB and type II non-ST Elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) secondary to acute HgB drop and catheter related sepsis (six points by SOFA); he was subsequently started on pantoprazole drip, beta blocker, rosuvastatin and three packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusions were given. Anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants were held because of UGB and pneumatic compression was ordered. Hemodialysis continued as usual and erythropoietin was administered. Vancomycin was started for treatment of _S. epidermidis_ bacteremia and endoscopy showed no bleeding, erythema or inflammatory changes suggestive of gastritis or ulceration in the entire examined stomach.\n\n【17】TTE demonstrated normal LVEF with a highly mobile, irregularly shaped echodensity (2.7 cm in maximum diameter) inside the right atrium (RA), suggestive of a catheter-associated thrombus (see Figs. 2 and 3 ). Due to high risk of embolization and sudden death risk he was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and cardio-thoracic surgery (CTS) was consulted.\n\n【18】CTS performed percutaneous removal under general anesthesia with Angiovac device because of bleeding risk of open thrombectomy. Intra-operative TEE showed no residual valve abnormalities and no remaining thrombus. After procedure, there were no immediate complications and patient remained in Surgical ICU for monitoring; 1 day later patient was extubated uneventfully. Pathology revealed calcified thrombus and negative culture growth. Patient was started on heparin anticoagulation on post-op Day 2, which was later bridged to warfarin 5 mg daily. He was then transferred to medical floor on post-op Day 3 and started ambulating without difficulties. HgB level increased to 8.3 g/dl following one more transfusion of pRBC. Patient was then discharged following several persistently negative blood cultures to complete 2-week course of outpatient vancomycin. Catheter was replaced for a right femoral vein one and patient continued with previous three times a week dialysis regimen.\n\n【19】**Figure 3**\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Parasternal right ventricular inflow view showing mobile thrombus (arrow).\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】Introduced in 2009, the AngioVac device is a vacuum-assisted thrombectomy system designed for _en bloc_ removal of large clot burden while avoiding bleeding and hemolysis risks associated with fibrinolytics, surgery and rheolytic systems \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Here we present a case of AngioVac use considered clinically relevant as this appears to be the first case of its use in a patient with an acute contraindication to anticoagulation.\n\n【24】In our literature review, a total of 45 cases of AngioVac use for thrombus aspiration was obtained including 15 cases of a single center case reports published by Donaldson _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\] in 2015. In those 45 cases, main clinical manifestation was dyspnea in 13 cases, followed by incidental finding of the thrombi in six cases and palpitations in five, which is consistent with this presented case. The initial diagnosis was made by TEE in seven cases, not specified in nine cases, CT scan and venogram in seven and four cases, respectively. Only three cases were initially diagnosed by TTE as the one reported here \\[ 6–11 \\]. In 15 cases, neither the clinical manifestations nor diagnostic approach was described. No report described UGB as a clinical finding.\n\n【25】The obtained material was removed from the inferior vena cava (IVC) in more than half of the cases, 11 of these cases had extent to RA. Only eight cases were isolated RA thrombi of which just six were related to catheters, consistent with epidemiologic data about rarity of RA thrombosis and highlighting the importance of the presented case. Obtained material consisted of thrombi in 80% of the cases, the remaining was associated to malignancy or vegetation. Only four cases reported a failed procedure and complications were reported in six cases with one septic emboli case and hematomas for the remaining five. \\[ 6–11 \\]. Particularly, in the Donaldson _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\] case report, 11 cases had post-procedural bleeding of which five needed transfusions due to overt bleeding, and an overall 87% of survival to discharge was reported, which suggests the AngioVac thrombectomy as an overall safe procedure for those high surgical risk patients.\n\n【26】A recent meta-analysis by Hameed _et al_ . \\[ 12 \\] was presented in 2019 with promising outcomes of this therapy. In this study, a total of 182 cases of AngioVac use were analyzed, of which 101 corresponded to thrombus removal. Successful removal pooled rate was 80.5 and 32.4 for right atrium/inferior vena cava (RA/IVC) thrombi and PE, respectively. As similar to the previously described cases, the need of conversion to open surgery had a low rate, with 12.3 pooled rate for thrombi removal. However operative mortality pooled rate was 14.8 and 32.3 for RA/IVC thrombi and PE, respectively, which should be taken into consideration when treating PE patients \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【27】All this being said, percutaneous thrombectomy with AngioVac device is a promising therapy, which needs more complex trials to evaluate specific outcomes and to answer questions such as precise indications and contraindications of this intervention as well as complication and failure rates. Available reports and recent meta-analysis suggest AngioVac thrombectomy as a viable option for those high surgical risk patients with an inspiring high successful and low mortality rates except for those patients with PE, in which outcomes seem to be worse with this therapy.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】To all the healthcare professionals who participated in the care of this case.\n\n【30】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【31】None declared.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】We, as authors, declare that no institution participated on funding of this project.\n\n【34】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【35】As this manuscript is based on the compilation of clinical record data and no clinical conduct was determined by the existence of it, we as authors consider no ethical approval other than patient’s informed consent is required.\n\n【36】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【37】Patient was informed about our desire to publish the case and after cautious explanation about the contents of the manuscript, informed consent was signed.\n\n【38】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【39】Hernan Leonardo Vera-Sarmiento, as main author is the guarantor of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She recovered with conservative treatment. She had continuous fever (approximately 38°C) attributed to the terminal leukemia, and thus steroid treatment was started. Five days after admission, she developed hematuria. Subsequently, she developed abdominal discomfort and bloating. Computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse bladder wall thickening, with air in the circumference of the bladder wall, and extraperitoneal and intramuscular gas ( Fig. 1 , arrows), suggesting bladder rupture from emphysematous cystitis. Cystography was not performed owing to her fragile state. Urinalysis revealed pyuria and urine culture showed growth of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ; however, blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam for 14 days, and continuous bladder irrigation for 9 days. Her hematuria improved and the hematoma. A CT scan for the abdomen was performed prior to hospital discharge, which showed a decrease in edema, as well as the air inside and outside of the bladder. She recovered completely through conservative therapy and was discharged from the hospital 22 days after admission.\n\n【1】Emphysematous cystitis is a rare complication of lower urinary tract infection, which is potentially life-threatening.

ORN of the skull has not been reported following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We report two cases of ORN of the skull following SRS for recurrent meningiomas post-resection. Both patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps in areas that received high doses of radiation due to their proximity to the recurrent tumors. In each case, the ORN was asymptomatic and was detected on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging. Both patients were followed closely with imaging that ultimately revealed either stability or improvement in the ORN, confirming the diagnosis without the need for biopsy. The cases reveal a role for close imaging surveillance instead of immediate biopsy in patients with new enhancement involving bone in high-dose radiation treatment regions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Osteoradionecrosis (ORN), ischemic necrosis of irradiated bone without evidence of persisting or recurrent tumor, is a known complication of radiation therapy, particularly in patients with head and neck cancer. The exact mechanism is unknown; however, the proposed mechanism is that radiation-induced vascular changes result in diminished blood flow and ultimately in a hypocellular, hypovascular and hypoxic environment \\[ 1 \\]. While often asymptomatic, symptoms and sequelae of ORN can vary in severity and include pain, fracture, chronic non-healing wounds and superimposed infections. To date, literature review did not reveal any reports of ORN of the calvarium following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We present two cases of ORN of the calvarium following SRS for recurrent meningiomas after initial resection.\n\n【4】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】The first patient is a 50-year-old woman with history of a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I meningioma in the parieto-occipital region, which was resected in 1999 with subsequent radiographic recurrence. Initial post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal residual tumor and annual MRIs were stable for 7 years. She was then lost to follow-up until 2012 when an MRI revealed a 25-mm contrast-enhancing lesion at the resection cavity consistent with meningioma recurrence, and corresponding computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of adjacent bone erosion ( Fig. 1A and B ). The patient was treated with linear accelerator-based, framed SRS (14 Gy in one fraction) to the recurrent meningioma. She did well without issues for 5 years except for the interval development a 9 mm focus of enhancement within the surrounding brain parenchyma that resolved in ~6 months without intervention and was ascribed to radiation treatment effect (RTE).\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Case 1 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI axial slice obtained at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (white arrow) and ( **B** ) comparable axial CT slice also obtained at the time of SRS; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 4 years post-SRS and ( **D** ) at the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **E** ) CT at the time of development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **F** ) corresponding relative cerebral blood volume map (from dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging) reveals relative hypoperfusion of the enhancing lesion (denoted by white arrowhead; red = increased perfusion, blue = decreased perfusion).\n\n【10】The patient’s MRI at 5 years post-SRS revealed a new enhancing lesion immediately adjacent to the treated meningioma, which in retrospect may have begun developing 4 years post-SRS ( Fig. 1C and D ). This lesion involved the craniotomy bone flap, and a head CT confirmed a new 38-mm osteolytic focus involving that segment of the cranium ( Fig. 1E ). Perfusion MRI showed relative hypoperfusion at this site ( Fig. 1F ). After examination of all available images, including overlay of the SRS isodose cloud ( Fig. 2A–D ), the appearance was most consistent with ORN. Repeat brain MRIs and head CTs 6 months and 1.5 years later revealed the stability of this lytic lesion as well as the residual treated meningioma ( Fig. 2E–H ). The patient remained asymptomatic with the exception of rare episodes of minor focal scalp discomfort. Given the continued stability, this process was determined to be most consistent with ORN and biopsy was not pursued.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Case 1 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion. Identical serial T1 post-contrast MRI axial slices obtained ( **A** , **B** ) at the time of the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS, with (B) showing the radiation isodose overlay (red corresponds to higher dose, blue to lower dose); identical CT head axial slices ( **C** , **D** ) at the time of the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS, with (D) showing the radiation isodose overlay revealing that the lesion is in the high-dose region; ( **E** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 6 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion and ( **F** ) comparable CT at the same timepoint; ( **G** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 1.5 years after the development of the lytic bone lesion and ( **H** ) comparable CT slice at the same timepoint.\n\n【14】### Case 2\n\n【15】The second patient is a 44-year-old woman, with a right posterior parasagittal WHO Grade II meningioma who underwent gross total resection in 2014 with post-operative imaging revealing no residual disease. No adjuvant therapy was pursued. She did well until a brain MRI in 2017 demonstrated a 2.1-cm recurrence along the superior sagittal sinus with no adjacent bone erosion on CT ( Fig. 3A and B ). She was asymptomatic and was treated with linear-accelerator-based, hypofractionated frameless SRS (30 Gy in five fractions) to the recurrent tumor. The patient did well for the next 2 years with significant tumor response except for the development of RTE in a small region of surrounding brain, which resolved without intervention.\n\n【16】Figure 3\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Case 2 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained in 2017 at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (denoted by arrowhead) and ( **B** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice windowed for bone at that same timepoint; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained at the time of development of an enhancing lesion involving bone at 1-year post-SRS (denoted by arrow) and ( **D** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice obtained at the that same timepoint revealing the lytic bone lesion at this site (denoted by arrow).\n\n【19】On serial imaging, an MRI 1-year post-SRS showed a new adjacent enhancing lesion that was associated with some bone lysis seen on CT without apparent growth of the treated meningioma ( Fig. 3C and D ). T1 post-contrast MRI and non-contrast head CT 3 months later revealed mild enlargement of the lesion ( Fig. 4A and B ). At this point, the differential diagnosis included ORN versus tumor progression. After discussion at tumor board, her case was felt to more likely represent ORN as the lytic lesion was within the high-dose region, as demonstrated on the isodose overlay ( Fig. 4C ). Further close interval monitoring was recommended. The next brain MRI 9 months after the development of the lytic lesion revealed stability of both the treated meningioma and the adjacent enhancing lesion ( Fig. 4D ), supporting the diagnosis of ORN.\n\n【20】Figure 4\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Case 2 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI and ( **B** ) comparable CT sagittal slices obtained 3 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion; ( **C** ) the radiation isodose is overlayed on the preceding CT showing that the high-dose region (red) corresponds to the location of the osteolytic lesion (presumed ORN) in this case; ( **D** ) sagittal T1 post-contrast MRI slice at 9 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of ORN of the skull following SRS. ORN is a known complication of radiation therapy most frequently reported following radiation to the head and neck. ORN can range in severity from being asymptomatic to causing pain, fractures, superimposed infection and chronic wounds \\[ 2 \\]. Management includes vitamin E and pentoxifylline for mild cases and hyperbaric oxygen and surgical resection for more severe cases \\[ 2–4 \\].\n\n【25】The mechanism of ORN is thought to involve inflammation and fibrosis of the periosteal vessels, resulting in ischemia and avascular necrosis \\[ 5 \\]. The mandible is particularly susceptible due to its relatively low vascularity \\[ 4 \\], but ORN can affect other bones such as ribs \\[ 6 \\], maxilla \\[ 3 , 4 \\] and vertebra \\[ 7 \\]. These two patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps after SRS to adjacent recurrent meningiomas.\n\n【26】After careful review in a multidisciplinary setting, the decision was made to follow the patients closely with imaging as opposed to proceeding with biopsy due to the high clinical suspicion for ORN. In each case, the craniotomy flap was within the high-dose region ( Figs 2 and 4 ). The risk of ORN increases with increasing dose to the affected bone \\[ 2 , 8 \\]. It is likely that post-surgical disruption of blood flow to these flaps was confounded by vascular changes secondary to high-dose radiation leading to ORN.\n\n【27】Diagnostic considerations in such cases include ORN and tumor recurrence. The definitive way to make a diagnosis is through pathology review; however, an invasive procedure can often be avoided using serial imaging in asymptomatic patients. Stability of the lesion without intervention favors a diagnosis of ORN over tumor recurrence. Perfusion imaging can distinguish between malignancy and radiation necrosis in the brain \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Radiation necrosis displays hypoperfusion, as was illustrated in the first case of ORN above, whereas malignancy displays hyperperfusion. While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to make the diagnosis, these cases demonstrate that, in patients with indolent courses, it is generally prudent to closely observe with imaging. In such cases, serial imaging revealing stability or improvement of the lesion(s) in question can solidify a diagnosis of ORN, avoiding an invasive procedure.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【31】None declared.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】None.\n\n【34】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【35】None required.\n\n【36】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【37】Consent was obtained from patients in both cases.\n\n【38】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【39】Ashley Schlafstein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Five months post TACE, she developed worsening abdominal discomfort, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scan showed evidence of progressive disease with increased FDG uptake in lesions involving segments 2, 3, 7 and 8 (Fig. 1 a). She was treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 ( <sup>90 </sup> Y) microspheres (SIR-Spheres <sup>® </sup> ), which were infused into left, middle and right hepatic arteries (Fig. 1 a). At 9-week follow-up, her abdominal discomfort had resolved and FDG-PET/CT scan demonstrated a near complete metabolic response (Fig. 1 b). Subsequent angiography revealed parasitized arterial supply to the segment 7 tumour from the inferior phrenic artery, which would explain the inadequate perfusion and dose delivery of <sup>90 </sup> Y microspheres (Fig. 1 a, cross-hairs) with only a partial response of the single lesion (Fig. 1 b, cross-hairs).\n\n【4】Figure 1:\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】( **a** ) FDG-PET/CT with axial views showing recurrent multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and perfusion of injected <sup>90 </sup> Y-tagged resin microspheres.

SIRT using <sup>90 </sup> Y-tagged resin microspheres emit high-energy beta radiation towards locoregional tumours \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Observational studies from Europe and the USA have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of SIRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trial data, SIRT has not been incorporated into international guidelines such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer treatment strategy as a standard of care \\[ 2 \\]. FDG-PET was shown to be a superior imaging modality for response assessment after SIRT \\[ 5 \\]. The dramatic clinical and FDG-PET/CT response seen in this case illustrates the potential roles for SIRT in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, both in symptom palliation and surgical downstaging. Well-designed and conducted clinical trials could inform new treatment strategies and provide hope for patients suffering from this deadly disease of global epidemic proportions.\n\n【9】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【10】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

He had mild cough but no chest pain, no stridor, no fever and no complaints of hemoptysis. Physical examination was normal. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a hypodense round lesion on the posterior wall of the trachea without clear retrotracheal limit ( Fig. 1A and B—arrows ). Rigid bronchoscopy using general anesthesia showed a pale pink tumor that involving 4/5 of the tracheal at 7 cm of cricoid cartilage with infiltration of the posterior surrounding tissue ( Fig. 1C ). After laser-guided devascularization, a mechanical resection of the entire endotracheal lesion using the tip of the rigid bronchoscope was performed. On histopathological examination, the lesion was consistent with a hamartochondroma. A flexible bronchoscopy carried out 6 weeks later showed no intraluminal lesion ( Fig. 1E ) and post-procedural MRI revealed mainly retrotracheal residual contrast enhancement, measured at 12 × 7 × 19 mm ( Fig. 1D—arrow ).

It affects mainly adults between 60 and 70 years old \\[ 2 \\]. Histopathologically, the tumor combines the criteria of two distinct benign tumors: hamartoma, which is mixt of different tissues composing a normal bronchus, and chondroma, which is a tumor of cartilaginous cells \\[ 2 \\]. In the largest series \\[ 3 \\], the sex ratio was 6.1 (37 men, 6 women) and 86% of patients were symptomatic with recurrent respiratory infections, central airway obstruction (mimicking COPD) \\[ 4 \\] and hemoptysis (30%). Bronchoscopy generally provides the diagnosis thanks to biopsies but is also, in case of endoluminal presentation, the only treatment. If endoscopic resection is not complete, surgery can be proposed with the aim to be as conservative as possible. Local recurrence is generally low. In the series of 43 patients published by Casío _et al._ , a recurrence occurred in four patients. This should deserve an endoscopic follow-up even though malignant transformation has not yet been described for this type of tumor unlike pure chondroma, which has the potential to evolve to chondrosarcoma \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【6】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【7】With this clinical case, we aimed to show that debulking of endotracheal hamartochondroma, using interventional bronchoscopic techniques, is feasible, effective and safe, and to demonstrate the diagnostic challenge of rare tracheal hamartochondroma masquerading as COPD.\n\n【8】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【9】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A large amount of blood was aspirated through a nasogastric tube, and chest computed tomography showed bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions, which suggested aspiration pneumonitis due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Her respiratory condition exacerbated, and we initiated nitric oxide (NO) therapy. Bleeding stopped with conservative treatment. She was weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated on Day 6 after admission. Afterward, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a longitudinal linear scar indicative of Mallory–Weiss syndrome (MWS). MWS is rarely reported in early infancy since many of the risk factors are absent in infants. Patients with aspiration pneumonitis usually recover respiratory function within 24 h and severe respiratory failure is rare in aspiration pneumonitis. There are no pediatric case reports describing MWS with severe aspiration pneumonitis. Although MWS is a rare cause of neonatal hematemesis, patients can become severely ill and require multidisciplinary treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Mallory–Weiss syndrome (MWS) is a condition, in which a sudden increase in intragastric pressure causes laceration of the mucosa near the esophagogastric junction. It is a rare cause of hematemesis in infancy \\[ 1 \\]. Although it can sometimes cause anemia or even shock because of severe bleeding, no case of infant with MWS complicated with severe aspiration pneumonitis has been reported. Herein, we present a case of MWS complicated by severe aspiration pneumonitis in an infant.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 1-month-old girl presented with hematemesis and dyspnea. Two hours after breastfeeding, she suddenly vomited a large amount of fresh blood without any identifiable cause and was transferred to a hospital. A large amount of coagulated blood was aspirated through a nasogastric tube, and chest computed tomography findings showed bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions ( Fig. 1A ). The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【6】As acute respiratory failure progressed, she was intubated to secure the airway, and mechanical ventilation was commenced. Her hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL, and venous blood gas analysis showed mixed acidosis (pH, 7.277; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 49.5 torr; bicarbonate level, 22.6 mmol/L; base excess, −4.3 mEq/L). Red blood cells were transfused, and she was transferred to our hospital for further medical care.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Bilateral centrilobular opacified lesions detected by chest computed tomography (A). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows a longitudinal linear scar at the gastroesophageal junction (B).\n\n【10】The patient was born via normal vaginal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation. No abnormalities were noted during the perinatal period. She seldom vomited after birth. On admission, her body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and percutaneous oxygen saturation on mechanical ventilation were 36.7°C, 170 bpm, 75/42 mm Hg, and 96%, respectively. Her breathing sound decreased bilaterally. Her white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein level, and platelet count were 13 200/μl, 0.72 mg/dl, and 293 000/μl, respectively. Coagulation tests were unremarkable.\n\n【11】Her respiratory condition rapidly exacerbated and hypercapnia progressed, which were suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome because of aspiration pneumonitis. We initiated nitric oxide (NO) therapy to treat pulmonary hypertension, because ultrasonography findings showed features of increased right ventricular pressure. In addition, gastric ulcer was also considered as a source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and therefore, proton pump inhibitors were administered.\n\n【12】After NO therapy (20 ppm) initiation, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen increased from 57 to 195 torr. The patient’s respiratory condition gradually improved within 24 h, and she was weaned off mechanical ventilation. She was extubated on Day 6 after admission. Supplemental oxygen was stopped on Day 8, and she was discharged on Day 16. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 2 weeks after discharge showed a longitudinal linear scar at the gastroesophageal junction ( Fig. 1B ), which was consistent with the healing process of MWS. Her gastric mucosal findings were normal, and it seemed unlikely that gastric ulcer caused the bleeding. Neither reflux esophagitis nor the separation between the squamocolumnar junction and the diaphragmatic impression were pointed out by upper endoscopy findings. After stopping the administration of proton pump inhibitors, vomiting and hematemesis did not recur. Gastroesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia could be ruled out based on the endoscopic findings and her clinical course. Pathological findings of the gastric and esophageal mucosa showed nonspecific inflammation with mild eosinophilic infiltration, which did not meet the diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Hematemesis caused by MWS is a relatively rare condition in early infancy. Back-Lomaniszyn _et al._ reported that MWS accounts for 12.8% of pediatric patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding \\[ 1 \\]. One reason for the rarity of this condition is that children rarely consume alcohol, which is known to trigger MWS \\[ 2 \\]. In addition, pathophysiological factors, such as greater tensile circumferential strength of the gastrointestinal tract of infants, may increase their resistance to mucosal laceration \\[ 3 \\]. An accurate pathogenesis of MWS in infancy has yet to be elucidated. In our case, there were no risk factors of MWS development, such as alcohol consumption, hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux. However, elevated abdominal pressure caused by heavy lifting or childbirth is a risk factor for MWS \\[ 2 \\]. Furthermore, crying or hiccups can elevate abdominal pressure and may cause mucosal tears in infants \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【15】Our patient developed severe aspiration pneumonitis due to massive bleeding, which was managed with mechanical ventilation and NO therapy. Patients with aspiration pneumonitis usually recover their respiratory function within 24 h without antibiotics. One study showed that 17% of adult cases with aspiration pneumonitis were treated in intensive care units and 4% died \\[ 5 \\]. Few fatal pediatric cases of aspiration pneumonitis have been reported \\[ 6 \\]. In one study, aspiration of stomach contents was found in 37% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome \\[ 7 \\]. Aspiration in infancy can be a cause of mortality and morbidity. The severity of our case can be attributed to the patient’s young age and inability to turn over, which caused much of the vomited blood to be aspirated into the airway. Although MWS is a rare cause of neonatal hematemesis, patients can become severely ill and require multidisciplinary treatment. Subsequent aspiration pneumonitis can cause severe respiratory failure that requires ventilator management and NO therapy. Notably, an animal study found that high-dose NO therapy may worsen lung damage when used for aspiration pneumonia \\[ 8 \\]. However, in this case, NO therapy was necessary because hypoxia and hypercapnia progressed with conventional ventilation. Although no specific side effects were observed after providing NO therapy, careful follow-up examination is necessary to determine the long-term effects. Clinicians should consider MWS as a differential diagnosis when examining an infant who presents with hematemesis and dyspnea.\n\n【16】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【17】We would like to thank Editage ( www.editage.com ) for English language editing.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】There is no source of funding to report for this case report.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【23】This report was approved for publication by the ethical committee of Gunma Children’s Medical Center (GCMC2018–112).\n\n【24】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【25】Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report.\n\n【26】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【27】Dr Akihiko Shimizu.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The treatment of choice of infected pregnant patients is amphotericin B, which is known to produce electrolyte imbalances.

It is mostly obtained during outdoor activities, causing a primary lung infection, which in rare circumstances can disseminate to the skin, bones and the genitourinary system. The initial presentation of pulmonary blastomycosis is often mistaken for other infectious or non-infectious etiologies \\[ 2 \\]. On very rare occasions, opportunistic fungal infections as the _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ can occur on pregnant women, which are partially immunosuppressed \\[ 3 \\]. This case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for blastomycosis, which was initially diagnosed as an inflammatory or malignant process in a pregnant woman and treated with amphotericin, as this is the only approved drug in pregnancy.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【11】We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman, 24 weeks pregnant, who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and productive cough for the last 3 months requiring frequent outpatient medical assessments. She did not have any recent travel, but she lives in Chicago. Physical examination revealed right basal crackles, but it was otherwise unremarkable. Initial workup revealed mild elevation of WBC at 11.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μl along with an unremarkable chest X-ray. Patient declined computed tomography (CT) chest due to concerns of radiation exposure and was discharged on oral antibiotics. Three weeks later, she developed worsening respiratory symptoms and basic blood work showed a WBC of 12 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> , she declined chest CT again and was sent on oral antibiotics. One month later, she was admitted at our hospital with hemoptysis and severe dyspnea, chest X-ray showed a large right upper lobe airspace opacity, subsequent chest CT showed a mass like consolidation on the right upper lobe measuring up to 9 cm in diameter and an additional mass of 2.2 cm in diameter in the left lower lobe. Findings were concerning for neoplasm with a multifocal infectious process also considered in the differential given appearance ( Fig. 1 ). She underwent an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the lung mass that showed pyogranulomatous inflammation with silver stain highlighting broad base budding yeast ( Fig. 2 ). Subsequent biopsy cultures were positive for Blastomyces dermatitidis and Blastomyces antigens in urine were positive, with values of 1.73 ng/ml.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Chest CT angiography revealing large confluent airspace opacity in the anterior right upper lobe abutting the chest wall and mediastinum (red arrow).

Silver stain highlighting a body yeast with characteristics of Blastomyces dermatitidis (red arrow).\n\n【18】Liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) was initiated and the patient symptoms progressively improved over the course of a week. Her course was complicated by profound hypomagnesemia (0.6 mmol/l) and hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/l) despite aggressive IV and oral repletion along with high doses of amiloride (40 mg). Creatinine levels were within normal limits through her treatment. After finalizing her amphotericin regimen, electrolyte disturbances resolved, and the patient had a pregnancy to term without any abnormality on her newborn.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Blastomycosis is endemic to the midwestern, southeastern and south-central USA, with an incidence rate that can reach 2.88 hospitalizations per 100 000 persons-year \\[ 4 \\]. The incubation period ranges between 3 and 15 weeks. Women are affected less frequently than men and pregnancy seems to be even less frequent. A 20-year retrospective observational study was able to find only 19 cases in pregnant patients, the age of affected women ranged from 17 to 39 years with the medium duration of pregnancy being 26 weeks. When untreated vertical transmission of the disease was reported \\[ 3 \\]. The infection can range from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a wide variety of infiltrates seen on imaging studies. Given that pregnancy is considered a mildly immunosuppressed state, prompt diagnosis and treatment are warranted.\n\n【21】A combination of clinical suspicion and antigenic testing usually guides therapy. However, histology and cultures are the gold standard and may be required, given that Blastomyces antigenic testing has been shown to have cross reactivity with other fungal infections \\[ 1 , 5 \\]. Pulmonary blastomycosis has non-specific symptoms (fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, cough) and can present in an acute or chronic manner with different degrees of severity. The radiographic findings can be mistaken with pneumococcal pneumonia, tuberculosis and cancer, thus earning the title of the ‘great pretender’ \\[ 2 , 6 \\]. Delay in diagnosis has been related to multiple antibiotic courses, disseminated disease and increase in mortality \\[ 7–9 \\]. Our patient underwent several antibiotic regimens and had a 3-month delay in diagnosis that likely allowed progression of the primary infection leading to CT chest finding of a large mass suspicious of malignancy. It is of note that initial Blastomyces urine antigen levels were low, despite the presence a 9 cm mass on CT.\n\n【22】Current guidelines recommend treating blastomycosis on pregnant patients with AmB since azoles have been reported associated with teratogenicity in animal models \\[ 9 \\]. The length of treatment on severe disease goes between 6 and 12 months. Liposomal amphotericin is safer when compared to other formulations; however, nephrotoxicity and electrolyte imbalances remain a considerable side effect and are secondary to an increase in the permeability to cations in the distal renal tubules. This is reflected by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia noted during surveillance laboratory blood work and replaced with supplementation as needed. Even when hypokalemia is expected, severe and persistent hypomagnesemia is not usually seen with AmB \\[ 10 \\]. Our patient required a total of 2940 Meq of potassium and a 116 mg of magnesium before reaching stable serum levels. This replacement was required despite of supratherapeutic doses of amiloride.\n\n【23】After reviewing literature, we have found only one other case of a pregnant woman with pulmonary blastomycosis presenting as a primary lung malignancy by Austin et al. Also, we were unable to find a report on profound and prolonged hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia requiring aggressive repletion on this same population. This case highlights the importance of including blastomycosis in the main differential diagnosis of pulmonary processes on endemic areas and to frequently monitor electrolytes on patients requiring amphotericin.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】No ethical approval was required for this article.\n\n【26】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Informed consent was obtained for this case.

In patients with cortical hearing loss (and in the absence of communication deficit, either total or partial, as in agnosia or aphasia), some attention-related or language-based disorders may lead to a wrong diagnosis of hearing impairment. The authors present two patients (8 and 11 years old) with no anatomical damage to the ear, the absence of neurological damage or trauma, but immature cortical auditory evoked potentials. Both patients presented a clinical history of multiple diagnoses over several years. Because the most visible symptom was moderate hearing loss, the patients were recurrently referred to audiological testing, with no improvement. This report describes the use of long-latency evoked potentials to determine cases of cortical hearing loss, where hearing impairment is a consequence of underdevelopment at the central nervous system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】We report two cases of centrally related hearing loss in children (8 and 11 years old) affected by an underdeveloped maturational processing in the primary auditory cortex that is initially observable through objective and subjective hearing impairment. Traditionally, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) have been used to obtain information of the area of the brain where the auditory cortex (primary and secondary) is located \\[ 1 \\]. Long-latency evoked potentials (LLEPs) are said to relate to attention, memory and auditory discrimination skills \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. We believe that LLEP is a robust test that can be applied to identify cortical hearing loss associated with immature central processing.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】An 8-year-old boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective hearing loss. The boy was initially diagnosed with a probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but no language-based learning disability had been found by a preliminary psychological assessment. A pure tone audiometry (250–4000 Hz) demonstrated thresholds of 45–60 dB hearing level (HL) for the right ear and 50–60 dB HL for the left ear (Fig. 1 A). Tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) as well as crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflexes were normal. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. An EEG test to discard tumor/trauma showed normal results. A well-formed brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test was recorded bilaterally (Fig. 1 C). Results in the perception test (identification of two-syllable words at different HL levels) proved 100% accuracy at 50 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 35 dB HL for the left ear. He then performed an LLEP test in three sweeps (80, 60 and 40 dB normal hearing level (nHL) tone bursts at 250–2000 Hz) in the right and left ears, alternatively, which shows the absence of CAEPs for the 40 dB nHL stimulation and polyphasic interwave morphology (Fig. 2 A). The patient was widely awake during the procedure with eyes open.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Audiogram and BAEP results for the 8-year-old child (on the left) and the 11-year-old child (on the right).

Latency values are delayed for all CAEPs. Even though similar wave morphology is observed at 60 dB nHL, CAEPs are not clearly found. At 60 and 40 dB nHL, interwave amplitude is polyphasic, with multiple periods between peaks, showing immature development according to the literature. ( **B** ) LLEP test for the 11-year-old boy. CAEPs can be observed at 80 dB nHL with double negativity. Latency values are delayed for all CAEPs, especially for N2. Interwave morphology is very irregular, with multiple periods, which is not normal for pre-teen age. Cortical maturation of the older child is similar to the young boy, which recommends further neuropsychological testing.\n\n【13】### Case 2\n\n【14】An 11-year-old boy presented at the Otorhinolaryngology day ward with a medical history of moderate language-based learning disorders. The boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective and subjective hearing loss. The patient had a previous pathology of bone dysplasia in the left malar. A pure tone audiometry showed normal hearing (Fig. 1 B), the results of the tympanogram and TEOAE were normal and the acoustic reflexes (stapedius reflex) of the middle ear showed no anatomical disorder. Results in the perception test proved 100% accuracy at 40 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 50 dB HL for the left ear. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. Neurological history was complemented with a BAEP test, which proved normality (Fig. 1 D). The LLEP test shows that waves with polyphasic morphology plus no CAEP could be identified for the 60 and 40 dB nHL stimulations (Fig. 2 B). The recording of CAEPs occurs while the patient was awake with eyes open.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Recent studies increasingly use CAEPs as an early indicator of cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia) \\[ 4 \\]. We present the same method adapted to children to identify immature cortical development that may only be appreciated through moderate hearing loss. Patients in this report present no lesion on the temporal lobe or any other neurologically related pathology. There is no visible damage to the anatomy of the auditory system or the peripheral nervous system. They share a long clinical history and moderate language-based deficit and/or attention. We have used latency (ms) but not amplitude as the measure to classify CAEPs (P1, N1a, N1b, P2 and N2). Amplitude may not be an objective measure for the population described here because its objective value decreases with attention, so it does not seem appropriate for younger patients or patients with a suspicion of attention deficits \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【17】Maturational changes in CAEPs include decreases in latency and amplitude as well as dynamic morphological changes \\[ 5 \\]. We have observed that interwave amplitude decreases with stimulus intensity, which was predictable. However, polyphasic morphology (multiple periods between CAEPs) should not be present in children older than 3 years \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. This fact is so obvious that it prevents from the identification of specific CAEPs. The neural generators of P1 originate in the thalamus–cortical projections to the auditory cortex and may represent the first recurring activity in the cortex. The emergence of N1, on the other hand, has been compared with the maturation of axon neurofilaments and various critical stages in speech perception \\[ 7 \\]. We could assume then that both P1 and N1 reflect second-order processing of the auditory cortex. Normal values for P1 can be found ∼97 ms for 7–8 years and ∼77 ms for 11–12 years \\[ 8 \\]. In our case, these values seem normal (78 ms) for the 8-year-old child and slightly late (89.5 ms) for the 11-year-old child. However, more clear is the emergence of double negativity represented by N1a and N1b \\[ 6 \\]. Latencies are delayed for the rest of CAEPs. The P2 component measures were 291.5 ms in the case of the 8-year-old child and 312.65 ms for the 11-year-old child (vs. normal 150 ms \\[ 8 \\]). The N2 component is present in the two patients, with late latencies (∼400 ms for both patients). Studies have also shown that the N2 component may be used as an objective measure of temporal processing ability \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Normal values for N2 are 243 ms (for 8 years old) and 226 ms (for 11 years old).\n\n【18】Overall, the preliminary diagnosis of hearing impairment in these patients needs to be complemented as a case of cortical hearing loss. The case of the pre-teen is especially important because objective and subjective audiological testing discarded severe hearing impairment, yet LLEP test indicates similar late maturation when compared with the younger boy. These cases are becoming more recurring in our clinic, which advises for the use of LLEP for two reasons: first, to identify whether we are dealing with a case of cortical loss and secondly, to assess the need to complement with neuropsychological testing (in the absence of neurological trauma/pathology). In the cases reported, values of P1 (78 and 89.5 ms, respectively) were within the normal range, with double N1 component and late latencies for P2–N2 when compared with standard values (291.5 and 312.65 ms for P2, respectively, vs. normal 150 ms; ∼400 ms for N2 vs. normal 243–226 ms, respectively). CAEP amplitude was not considered, but the polyphasic morphology of the waves and the absence of some CAEPs at various intensity levels were used to demonstrate underdevelopment at the cortical area that advises for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【19】In conclusion, this case report gives evidence of two children who display some learning difficulties, as reported by caregivers and psychologists. The two children are initially diagnosed with light to moderate hearing loss by the delivery of subjective tests (pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry). However, TEOAE and immittance audiometry (stapedius reflex) proved normal for both patients. In the absence of any anatomical damage to the ear or neurological lesion/trauma as tested by CT scan and EEG, a combination of two electrophysiological tests (BAEP and LLEP) led to the final diagnosis of a centrally related hearing loss: with normal BAEP results, late latency in LLEP proved the lack of maturational central processes in both children, which coincide with psychological evidence. These results advise for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】This work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (FFI2010-18205) and the Secretary of State for Research, Development and Innovation.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】Research presented in this manuscript has obtained ethical approval by Hospital Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, and University of Seville (Spain).\n\n【26】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【27】Participants in this report and parents/tutors have been informed on details of the study, including benefits in participation, possible risks, right to leave without previous notice and all contact information from responsible researchers.

This leads not only to a variation in clinical presentations, but it was also thought to alter responsiveness to antibiotic treatment. Unlike in Europe, in the USA there are no head-to-head trials of oral and intravenous antibiotics in the treatment of neuroborreliosis. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) state that oral doxycycline is probably safe and effective in treating neuroborrliosis without parenchymal involvement, this was mainly extrapolated from European studies data with no reports from North America. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Lyme meningo-radiculitis successfully treated with oral doxycycline alone in the USA. This comes in support of the oral doxycycline as an initial and even monotherapy for non-parenchymal Lyme disease of the nervous system in the USA.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The clinical manifestations of neuroborreliosis are different between the USA and Europe perhaps due to different prevalence of spirochete strains. Guidelines published in 2007 by the AAN state that both intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline are probably effective and safe in treating CNS Lyme without parenchymal involvement (Level B recommendation). To the best of our knowledge, treatment of Lyme radiculitis with oral doxycycline has not been reported previously in the USA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old Caucasian female presented with progressive left leg and lower back pain following 3 weeks of fever and headache. She did not recall any tick bites but lives on a farm in southern Massachusetts. She has never traveled to Europe. Physical examination showed hypoesthesia on the lateral surface of the left leg, weakness on dorsiflexion and inversion of the left foot, diminished ankle and knee reflexes on the left (brisk on the right) and no Babinski signs (Fig. 1 ). Serology was abnormal for a positive C6 index >5.0 (normal value <0.90) and Lyme IGM western blot (kD 23, kD 41 IgM bands reactive). The Lyme IgG western blot was negative (kD41, kD45 reactive). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count was 520/cmm (normal range 0–5/cmm) predominantly lymphocytes; protein 120 mg/dl (normal range 15–45 mg/dl) and glucose of 41 mg/dl (normal range 38–85 mg/dl). Lumbo-sacral MRI showed enhancement in multiple roots of the cauda equina and in the thecal sac surrounding the conus medullaris. Due to a history of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone, she was treated with oral doxycycline for 6 weeks. At follow-up, 7 weeks later, her pain and tingling had almost completely resolved. Examination showed only residual patchy sensory loss on the left leg. Repeat CSF examination was significantly improved (WBC 8 cells; protein 20 mg/dl).\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】T <sub>1 </sub> \\-weighted fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the lumbosacral spine, Before treatment: ( **A** ) sagittal with full arrow referring to conus medularis surface enhancement, ( **B** ) axial with dotted arrow referring to intrathecal root enhancement.

Lyme disease is a tick borne illness caused by the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto._ The nervous system is involved in 10–15% of patients. The triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis and radiculoneuritis is known in Europe as Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome \\[ 1 \\]. The incidence of radiculoneuritis in the USA is ∼3% but may be under-recognized \\[ 1 \\]. Prevalent strains are different in Europe and the USA \\[ 2 \\], so it is unclear whether treatment effects might also differ. The CSF concentration of doxycycline after oral administration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentrations of most strains of _B. burgdorferi_ in pharmacological studies \\[ 3 \\]. There are no trials from the USA comparing the intravenous and oral routes of administration of antibiotics for neuroborreliosis. Guidelines published in 2007 by the AAN state that both IV ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline are probably effective and safe in treating neuroborreliosis without parenchymal involvement (Level B recommendation) \\[ 4 \\]. In Europe, eight comparative studies found a response rate to oral doxycycline that was no different than that of parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone \\[ 4 \\]. None of the studies was blinded, not all were randomized clinical trials \\[ 4 \\]. Outcomes were assessed not only by clinical improvement but also by objective serological and CSF data as surrogates for treatment response \\[ 5 \\]. In our patient, the response was demonstrated clinically, radiologically and through improvement of CSF results, which is in agreement with previous reports from Europe and adds to our understanding of Lyme disease here in the USA.\n\n【11】In conclusion, oral doxycycline may be sufficient as the initial treatment of neuroborreliosis without parenchymal involvement in the USA. More studies are needed to establish the role of oral doxycycline in the management of North American Lyme disease and to characterize the syndromes for which intravenous antibiotics are required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It has been rarely reported to have an association with pre-eclampsia \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. It is characterized by cotton-wool patches, retinal whitening, and superficial retinal hemorrhages.

SMD has a common association of pre-eclampsia SMD and it does not occur in Purtscher-like retinopathy. OCT demonstrates that ischemia affects the inner retinal layers in Purtscher-like retinopathy and it enables the imaging of SMD. Visual recovery can occur spontaneously in the majoriy of patients.

We present a case of rapid onset of systolic dysfunction with cardiogenic shock, which developed after the surgical excision of an adrenal gland tumor in a 60-year-old male. Coronary angiography excluded coronary artery disease. The echocardiography and ventriculography images suggested Takotsubo cardiomyopathy pattern. Following 2 weeks of inotropic and vasopressor therapy, the left ventricular function gradually improved, until complete resolution.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare catecholamine-producing tumors (0.2–0.6% of hypertensive patients; \\[ 1 \\]), which could appear sporadically or be part of a hereditary syndrome. An even rarer occurrence is the association between pheochromocytomas and Takotsubo syndrome. We discuss the case of a patient who developed Takotsubo syndrome and subsequent cardiogenic shock during surgery for an adrenal tumor.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old male patient was admitted to the Surgery Department for the removal of a recently diagnosed left adrenal gland tumor \\[ 2 \\]. The patient’s medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, moderate aortic regurgitation (regurgitant orifice area 0.2 cm <sup>2 </sup> ) and recently diagnosed secondary arterial hypertension. Three months prior to admission, the patient started experiencing specific spells, with anxiety, agitation, headaches, pallor, palpitations and hypertensive crises. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan described a left adrenal mass ( Fig. 1A and B ). The association between a CT image of a left adrenal tumor and elevated urinary normetanephrines and metanephrines pointed towards catecholamine-producing tumor \\[ 1 \\]. Upon admission the patient was hemodynamically stable: blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen levels within normal range. The preoperative preparation of the patient consisted of 30-day treatment with alpha and beta adrenergic blockade: doxazosin 1 mg/day and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】( **A** ) Abdominal CT coronal view of a left adrenal nodule compressing the splenic vein; ( **B** ) Abdominal CT axial view of left adrenal nodule compressing the splenic vein; ( **C** ) Intraoperative aspect of the nodule; during retraction, pressure exerted on the nodule caused spikes of arterial blood pressure; ( **D** ) resection specimen.\n\n【9】Initial blood tests were within normal range. His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and negative T waves in the lateral leads. The echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, no regional wall motion abnormalities and a moderate aortic regurgitation. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index \\[ 3 \\] amounted to 1 point and showed a class II risk.\n\n【10】The patient underwent standard lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy using four trocars \\[ 2 \\]. During dissection, even gentle manipulation of the tumor caused spikes of arterial pressure up to 180 mmHg but all receded after control of the main left adrenal vein ( Fig. 1C and D ). During the surgery, after the removal of the tumor, the patient became hemodynamically unstable. He presented hypotension (50/30 mmHg) and new onset bundle branch block (LBBB). He was moved directly to the angiography room and emergency coronarography was performed. The ventriculography described circumferential midventricular akinesia ( Fig. 2A and B ). The coronarography showed no obstructive atherosclerotic disease of epicardial vessels, low flow TIMI 2 and no vasospasm ( Fig. 2C and D ). The echocardiography showed left ventricular circumferential midventricular and apical akinesia and a LVEF of 25% ( Supplementary Video 1 ). The patient had important dynamic changes in troponin levels (a maximum value of 21.9 ng/ml on the second-postoperative day, with an upper reference limit \\[URL\\] of 0.2 ng/ml) and high NT-proBNP values (a maximum value of 7000 pg/ml on the second-postoperative day with an URL of 300 pg/ml). He stayed in intensive care unit for 12 days requiring inotropic and vasopressor support and for the first three days he required intubation and mechanical ventilation _._ The left ventricular systolic function improved gradually. On the 12th day after the surgery, the patient no longer required oxygen or vasopressors and was transferred to the Cardiology Department. On the 15th-postoperative day, the echocardiography showed a left ventricle with no regional motion abnormalities, a dramatically improved ejection fraction of 55% ( Supplementary Video 2 ), normal troponin levels and the electrocardiogram no longer presented LBBB ( Fig. 3 ). The pathology report described a pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score (PASS) of seven, which rendered the tumor as biologically aggressive. Furthermore, one out of seven resected lymph nodes had similar tumor cells, thus the tumor was staged as pT3N1 (TNM). At the 1-month follow up, the patient had normal blood pressure values (120/75 mmHg) and preserved LVEF (55%).\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Ventriculogram showing left ventricular „ballooning”—midventricular akinesia ( **A** ) Telesystolic and ( **B** ) Teledyastolic; ( **C** ) Coronary angiography showing right coronary artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis; ( **D** ) Coronary angiography showing left main, left descending artery and circumflex artery with no atherosclerotic significant stenosis.\n\n【14】**Figure 3**\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Electrocardiogram ( **A** ) Before the surgery; ( **B** ) Immediately after the surgery; ( **C** ) on the 15th-postoperative day.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】We present the case of a patient with no history of systolic dysfunction who developed Takotsubo syndrome (TS) after the surgical removal of a pheochromocytoma, which raised complex issues regarding diagnosis and treatment. Pheochromocytomas are rare, catecholamine secreting tumors \\[ 1 \\]. An even rarer occurrence is the coexistence of pheochromocytoma and TS, probably due to catecholamine excess \\[ 4 \\]. The patient was monitored closely by the anesthesia care team and drugs which could promote catecholamine release were avoided. During the surgery, as the patient became hemodynamically unstable, the differential diagnosis consisted of acute coronary syndrome, hypovolemic shock and anesthesia induced hypotension. Because the condition manifested as acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock and electrocardiographic changes, coronary artery disease had to be ruled out. The patient’s recent history showed no indication of a viral infection, no inflammatory markers present and no pericardial effusion \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【19】Following the diagnostic algorithm of TS, the patient started with an InterTAK Score of low/intermediate probability, the coronary angiography showed no coronary lesions, he had no red flags of acute myocarditis and after 15 days he had no wall motion abnormalities, which leads to the diagnosis of TS \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【20】Sympathetic activation has a central role in the pathophysiology of TS, with high levels of circulating catecholamines \\[ 4 , 6 \\]. Therefore, the management of the patient was based on inotropic and vasopressors agents, while attempting to avoid any adrenergic agonists, as they could aggravate the condition \\[ 4–6 \\]. When the patient became hemodynamically unstable, he was treated at first with dobutamine and noradrenaline. Then, he was started on levosimendane and vasopressin. But, as the blood pressure could not be elevated, he also received noradrenaline. Gathering all the arguments, we conclude that this case was a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, a transient systolic dysfunction associated with the surgical stress of the removal of a catecholamine secreting tumor.\n\n【21】TS is a complex pathology, frequently associated with an excess of catecholamines, which requires careful consideration regarding diagnosis and treatment. We regard this case as a suddenly acquired, reversible systolic dysfunction associated with the perioperative surgical stress of the removal of a pheochromocytoma.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【23】Dr Irina Tudose, Dr Vlad Mageriu.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】No funding was received for this work.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】No approval was required.\n\n【30】Consent has been obtained from the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Eosinophilia is also common in HIES patients. HIES is often underdiagnosed in Syria as it cannot be confirmed without genetic testing, which is unavailable across Syria for HIES. We present the first case from Syria of a suspected child with HIES that has some additional distinct features. Other cases in a regional country carried atypical novel mutations, which may indicate that these mutations may exist in Syria as well. However, our case had findings that were not reported with other HIES cases. Determining these genes in the case presented was not possible, and future studies need to overcome this hurdle.\n\n【2】Hyper IgE Syndrome , Job syndrome , novel mutations , Syria , Symptoms\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is a rare hereditary primary immunodeficiency. It is characterized by a classical triad of high immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, recurrent pneumonia with pneumatocele and recurrent cold skin abscesses from staphylococcus infections \\[ 1 \\]. Patients also suffer from chronic candidiasis and have ophthalmic manifestations such as conjunctivitis, spontaneous corneal perforation and strabismus \\[ 1 \\]. While most cases of HIES are sporadic, some case can be familial with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【5】HIES is caused by multiple gene defects, some of which are still being studied, and novel mutations were found in Lebanese families who had a few distinct features than typical HIES \\[ 3 \\]. These mutations may also exist in Syria as it neighbors Lebanon, and they both share a common background.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 17-year-old male came with swollen left knee and forefinger. He previously had diagnosed with multiple cold abscesses. The child has consanguineous parents as they were first cousins. The patient also had itchy eczematous and desquamating eruptions on the trunk and scalp around the age of six months. Atopic dermatitis was subsequently diagnosed and managed conservatively. By the age of two, the patient had a pea-sized lateral abscess in the neck that reached the size of a golf ball in one year. It was managed by antibiotics and drainage with culture yielding _Staphylococcus aureus_ . Afterwards around the age of five, an abscess was formed on the scalp behind the ear, which was also caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ . By the age of six, an abscess was formed on the skin on the right parotid gland. By the age of ten, an abscess was formed in the groin extending to the right scrotum. Around the age of 12, an abscess that grew _Staphylococcus aureus_ was formed on the lateral side of the left thigh, and the knee was also swollen. Finally by the age of 14, the patient had a swollen left forefinger. The histopathology revealed a xanthoma in the scalp and xanthogranuloma with abscess formation in the salivary gland with no malignant or tuberculosis features. The patient declared that he had normal teeth development and no ophthalmological symptoms. No history of pneumonia was noted. Family history was also insignificant.\n\n【8】On examination, the current swelling on the knee and forefinger were solid, non-tender and not warm to touch ( Fig. 1 ). The patient had minor desquamating and peeling skin over the soles and palms. No scoliosis was noted, but the patient had a distinguished facies ( Fig. 2 ). He had a broad nasal bridge, a depressive asymmetric face, a mild prognathism and coarse features. He was in a good general condition and had a good appetite. However, the patient was pale and had a short stature (147 cm), which was nearly four standard deviations (SD) below the mean height of his parents with no signs of puberty (Tanner I). No oral thrush was noted, and teeth examination was normal. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepato-splenomegaly.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】It demonstrates the lesions on the knee and finger and the multiple scars on the abdomen.\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】It demonstrates the distinguished facies of the child.\n\n【15】The patient had normal WBCs count, platelet count, electrolytes, urine analysis and lipid profile, but eosinophil count was 541 cells/mcl, he had microcytic anemia Hb (6.4 g/dl) and MCV was (54 fl). Blood film showed hypochromic microcytic red blood cells, and an increased eosinophil count (10%). Hemoglobin electrophoresis and tuberculosis Mantoux test were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a high gamma protein level, with low alpha 1 and albumin levels, and a total complement protein level (ch50) of 59 U/ml ( _n_ \\> 23), IgE: 2780 IU/ml ( _N_ < 100), IgG: 2773 ( _N_ : 700–1600), IgM: 184 ( _N_ : 40–230). Chest X-ray was normal. Knee and finger X-rays revealed an enlargement of soft tissue with intact bones ( Fig. 3 ). Knee MRI showed a subcutaneous loculated effusion, and hematomas in the sub- and supra-patellar and the popliteal fossa. MRI of the head was normal with a normal pituitary stalk and no thickening. MRI of the neck ( Fig. 4 ) demonstrated an elliptical segmented lesion with thick walls in the right parapharyngeal space that measured 5 × 6 × 8 cm, which was suggestive of an abscess. The patient scored around 33 on the Grimbacher et al. 1999 scale for assessing HIES \\[ 4 \\], which was indicative of a possible STAT3-deficient HIES \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【16】**Figure 3**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】It demonstrates the X-rays of the knee and finger.\n\n【19】**Figure 4**\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】MRI of the head and neck showing the lesions in the neck (arrow).\n\n【22】Table 1\n\n【23】xxxx\n\n【24】|  |\n| --- |\n\n【25】|  |\n| --- |\n\n【26】Open in new tab\n\n【27】Table 1\n\n【28】xxxx\n\n【29】|  |\n| --- |\n\n【30】|  |\n| --- |\n\n【31】Open in new tab\n\n【32】In the hospital, the patient stayed for three weeks and developed pneumonia that was improved with empirical antibiotics consisting of vancomycin and meropenem. The patient was discharged and was given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as prophylaxis against staphylococcus, but follow-ups could not be attended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n【33】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【34】HIES consists of multiple overlapping primary immunodeficiency conditions, each of which has its distinct features. The most common defects are a deficiency of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and a deficiency of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) \\[ 6 \\]. Genetic testing is considered the golden standard for STAT3-deficient HIES while Th17 cells testing can be used for a probable HIES, and a scoring system \\[ 4 \\] is used for a probable STAT3 mutation \\[ 5 \\]. The patient got 10 points for the IgE level, 8 for the number of abscesses, 3 for the eosinophil count, 5 for the congenital anomalies, 4 for the congenital rash, 2 for the eczema and 1 for the wide nose. In total, the patient got 33. We can also add one point for the confirmed pneumonia.\n\n【35】Diagnosis can be problematic as there is no clear criteria and symptoms are quite diverse similar to our case. However, most clinicians diagnose HIES with its clinical features, and the scoring system is used to evaluate for STAT3 probability \\[ 5 \\]. We could not identify the mutations due to the unavailable genetic testing for HIES in Syria and the financial disadvantage, which affected many other cases and have delayed diagnosis and treatment \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【36】The most common locations for cold abscesses are the face and the trunk. Pulmonary complications exist in 77% of cases, which were absent in our case. Patients can have distinctive coarse facies features that become universal by 16 years of age, including asymmetrical faces, hemitrophy, prominent foreheads, broad nasal bridges, mild prognathism and deep-set eyes ( Fig. 2 ) \\[ 1 \\]. Scoliosis can also occur in 63% of cases, and all patients have some degree of eczema. Prophylactic antibiotics against staphylococcus can be used such as TMP-SMX as reoccurrence is not uncommon \\[ 1 \\]. However, as HIES was not diagnosed the patient did not take staphylococcus prophylaxis in previous visits.\n\n【37】In one study on Lebanese participants with HIES, two sporadic mutation carriers were of consanguineous parents \\[ 3 \\]. This is similar to our patient who had consanguineous parents with no history of HIES in the family. Our patient also had arthropathy of the knee, hematomas and a cold abscess in the parapharyngeal space, which are different from the Lebanese patients. Moreover, the patient had unexplainable xanthoma and hematomas, which are atypical for HIES.\n\n【38】The eczema in HIES is difficult to be distinguished from atopic dermatitis. However, a long course from early life with atypical distribution such as in the axilla and groin, recurrent staphylococcus infections with cold abscesses and resistant to conventional treatment are signs of HIES dermatitis rather than atopic dermatitis \\[ 1 \\]. Our case had peeling skin over the soles and palms and was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis in infancy. One of the most important differential diagnosis for xanthomas is Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which can present with consistent eczema, and unexplained skin lesions. However, histology and immunophenotyping were not suggestive in our case. Our patient did not have pituitary manifestations, stalk thickening or diabetes insipidus, which can be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis \\[ 9 \\]. Other differential diagnoses include aspergillosis, and other immune deficiencies such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS). WAS is an immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections and high IgE levels \\[ 10 \\]. The patient had recurrent cold staphylococcus abscesses and did not have the other features of WAS, which made the diagnosis highly unlikely \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【39】In conclusion, HIES is a rare disease that is understudied and underdiagnosed in Syria although there is a high potential for novel mutations in the region. Despite our case having many typical HIES features, xanthoma and knee hematomas were unique. This study provides an insight into HIES for physicians in the region and encourages future work on the matter.\n\n【40】DECLARATIONS\n------------\n\n【41】### ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n\n【42】Informed consent was taken for this research.

Subsequent investigations, including biopsy of the uvula, confirmed sarcoidosis, and the patient was successfully treated with prednisone for 8 months with resultant remission of his sarcoidosis. In 2004, he represented with mild asymptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND), evidenced by sinus bradycardia, and additionally, a first-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) on electrocardiogram. He again represented in 2017 with symptomatic SND and subsequently underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MR). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) images of the left ventricle demonstrated linear mid-myocardial hyperenhancement on the basal septum, and patchy hyperenhancement in the inferoseptal wall (see panel A, Fig. 1 ). This pattern of enhancement is highly suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis in the clinical context of a prior histologic diagnosis of sarcoidosis with cardiac arrhythmia \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. On 3D-LGE MR of the atria, the reconstructed 3D color models demonstrated areas of hyperenhancement (see panels B and C, Fig. 1 ), indicating atrial fibrosis \\[ 3 \\]. The amount of fibrosis in the atria was quantified at 6.9% on the left atrium, and 6.2% on the right atrium using a method that accounted for both the mean and standard deviation of the MRI signal intensity in the left atrial blood pool \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Notably, recent data using endocardial voltage mapping in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found that 90% of patients with paroxysmal, and 65% of patients with persistent AF had no detectable left atrial fibrosis \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【4】Figure 1:\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】( **A** ) 2D LGE PSIR image in short axis plane demonstrating linear hyperenhancement in the basal septum (black arrow) and patchy enhancement in the basal inferoseptal wall (white arrow); ( **B** ) 3D-LGE MR images reconstructed as 3D color models showing patchy areas of enhancement indicating fibrosis (green areas) and normal atrial myocardium (white background) in the posterior wall of the left atrium (B) and posterior wall of the right atrium ( **C** ).\n\n【7】In the absence of evidence to demonstrate active cardiac sarcoidosis on clinical examination, echocardiography (normal biventricular function without significant valvulopathy), or computed tomography of the chest, prednisone was not prescribed.

Ocular metastasis secondary to gastrointestinal malignancy is rare. In managing patients with ocular metastasis, quality of life (specifically vision preservation) is one of the most important factors patients and providers consider when deciding on a treatment regimen. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have shown promising results as second-line therapy for patient with metastatic malignancy. We describe a novel case of a functionally monocular patient with known metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma who developed poor vision and a large choroidal lesion in his better seeing eye. The lesion regressed and vision restored to 20/20 after treatments with pembrolizumab in this case report.\n\n【2】Choroidal metastasis , pembrolizumab , esophageal carcinoma , PD-li inhibitors , quality of life , macular edema\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Ocular metastasis from systemic malignancy is the most common type of ocular tumor and noted in 12.6% of cancer patients on post-mortem examination \\[ 1 \\]. Choroidal metastasis may be a presenting sign of primary or recurrent malignancy, portends very poor survival rates, and is frequently associated with significant visual impairment \\[ 2 \\]. Ocular metastases are present in up to 4% of patients with primary gastrointestinal malignancies \\[ 3 \\], most commonly arising from the lower GI tract and rarely from the esophagus \\[ 4–6 \\]. Esophageal adenocarcinoma has a particularly poor prognosis with an approximate 5-year survival rate of 22% \\[ 7 \\], despite treatments including surgical resection, radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy \\[ 2 , 8 \\]. Quality of life in these patients is severely compromised during aggressive therapy. Vision preservation is frequently reported as one of the most important quality of life indicators \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【5】The introduction of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors (such as pembrolizumab) in recent years have shown promising data in the treatment of esophageal cancer \\[ 9 \\]. We present a novel case of a patient with known esophageal adenocarcinoma who was found to have a new onset choroidal metastasis. The patient was treated with pembrolizumab with rapid visual improvement to 20/20 and complete resolution of the uveal mass.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 83-year-old Caucasian man with a history of a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema (receiving as-needed intravitreal bevacizumab injections in the right eye and advanced open-angle glaucoma with poor vision in the left eye) presented with new vision complaints. Six months earlier at his previous visit, his visual acuity was 20/20 with resolved branch vein occlusion. He described gradual painless loss of a half-moon of central vision in the right eye over a three-month period. Past medical history was pertinent for known recurrent HER2 receptor positive esophageal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and right pleural base as well as poor cardiac and functional status of 24-month duration. He was previously treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions 11 months earlier and completed local radiation to the primary esophageal mass 13 months earlier.\n\n【8】Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/150 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye (normal range 10–25 mm hg). Anterior segment slit lamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Posterior segment examination of the right eye was notable for a 10.5-sq-mm choroidal lesion centered along the inferior temporal arcade extending into the inferior macula with serous retinal detachment of the macula ( Figs 1A , 2A and 3A ) with no additional lesions noted in either eye. In view of patient’s medical history, the mass was presumed to be choroidal metastasis secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Local and systemic treatment options including proton beam irradiation and immunotherapy were discussed with the assistance of the oncology team. Ultimately, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was selected to treat the lesion to preserve vision and maintain superior quality of life.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】(A) Fundus photo of the right eye demonstrating a large inferior subretinal lesion.

(B) OCT of the right macula seven weeks after initiation of pembrolizumab demonstrating resolved macular edema and subretinal fluid.\n\n【18】The patient was initiated on 200-mg intravenous pembrolizumab therapy every 21 days with the first dose administered three weeks after initial ophthalmologic evaluation. The patient was seen for ophthalmology follow-up one day after the second infusion. BCVA had improved to 20/40–1 in the right eye with marked decrease in size of the choroidal lesion and serous retinal detachment ( Figs 1C , 2B and 3B ). At 15 weeks following initiation of pembrolizumab infusions the patient’s visual acuity improved to 20/20 ( Figure 3B ). The lesion height regressed completely (4.4–0.7 mm) and became hypopigmented ( Figs 1D and 2C ).\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Ocular metastases are present in up to 4% of patients with primary gastrointestinal malignancies \\[ 3 \\], most commonly arising from the lower GI tract and rarely from the esophagus \\[ 4–6 \\]. Metastases from lung and breast cancer are the most common, present in up to 26 and 37% of patients with primary lung and breast cancer, respectively \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【21】Esophageal adenocarcinoma has a particularly poor prognosis with an approximate 5-year survival rate of 22% \\[ 7 \\], even with treatments including surgical resection, radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy \\[ 2 , 8 \\]. Esophageal adenocarcinoma metastasis represents less than 1% of all choroidal metastatic lesions. Choroidal metastasis can present as a challenging treatment dilemma depending on characteristics of the mass, extent of systemic disease, treatment goals of the patient and availability of treatment modalities \\[ 2 \\]. Date et al. reported an excellent outcome in a patient with recurrent metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil and trastuzumab \\[ 6 \\]. Other reports of choroidal metastasis of esophageal adenocarcinoma have been treated with external beam irradiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy and enucleation with variable improvement of visual symptoms but inevitable death from the systemic complications of the primary malignancy \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]. Quality of life is often compromised from these aggressive therapies. Reports of the use of pembrolizumab in patients with secondary choroidal metastasis have been described only in cases with primary cutaneous melanomas \\[ 7 \\], with no reports of its use in the setting of choroidal metastases associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【22】PD1 expression and ligation to PDL1 in neoplastic cells results in a transduction of signals that allows for evasion of neoplastic cells from T-cell mediated immune response. By blocking this interaction, PD1 inhibitor immunotherapy such as pembrolizumab has become integral in the approach to treating cancers \\[ 9 \\]. The safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors continues to be under investigation, though it has been shown to have less adverse events than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced esophageal carcinoma \\[ 8 \\]. Adverse events from anti-PD-1 therapy are thought to occur via excessive activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, which result in excessive inflammation in normal tissues. In a large meta-analysis of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced gastro-esophageal cancer, no major ocular-specific complaints were noted \\[ 8 \\]. However, cases have described inflammatory ocular sequelae of pembrolizumab including serous retinal detachment, choroidal effusion and detachment, and posterior uveitis, including birdshot-like chorioretinopathy and retinal vasculitis \\[ 10 \\]. In one particular case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma without ocular metastasis, after three months of pembrolizumab infusions the patient developed isolated biopsy-confirmed vitreous metastasis that was thought to be caused by pembrolizumab-mediated retinal vascular leakage.\n\n【23】In conclusion, pembrolizumab successfully and rapidly decreased the size of choroidal metastasis, restored vision without any adverse events and improved quality of life. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors offer promising treatment outcomes with improved side effect profile compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our patient demonstrated rapid improvement of lesion size and visual acuity without any adverse events observed at six months of follow-up.\n\n【24】FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES/FUNDING\n-----------------------------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】CONSENT FROM PATIENT\n--------------------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient (giving explicit permission for this report).\n\n【30】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【31】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although systemic thromboembolism is a commonly associated condition, antiphospholipid syndrome is less common. Nevertheless, treatment generally involves long-term anticoagulation. We report a case of a patient with previously undiagnosed NBTE who suffered systemic thromboembolic events despite pre-existing treatment with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare condition characterized by non-infectious lesions affecting the cardiac valves \\[ 1 \\]. NBTE is strongly associated with malignancy and can also be associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) \\[ 1 \\]. Systemic thromboembolism is a common manifestation of NBTE and occurs in up to 50% of patients \\[ 2 \\]. Valvular dysfunction may also occur, occasionally requiring surgical valvular intervention \\[ 1 \\]. Treatment with anticoagulation is recommended; however, the optimal strategy is unclear \\[ 3 \\]. We report a case of a patient with previously undiagnosed NBTE who presented with multi-organ systemic thromboembolism despite pre-existing treatment with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old man with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation and previous lower limb deep vein thrombosis presented at hospital with a 1-day history of transient left-sided arm paraesthesia in the absence of chest pain. His regular medications included apixaban 5 mg twice daily and digoxin 125 micrograms daily. He was normotensive, had a resting heart rate of 105/min and was afebrile. A systolic murmur was noted over the aortic area without radiation to the carotid area. There were no clinical signs of cardiac failure. Neurological examination demonstrated normal upper and lower limb tone, power, reflexes, sensation and coordination. Splinter haemorrhages were noted in his fingernails ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Splinter haemorrhages\n\n【9】The patient is an electrician by occupation and there was no history of tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption or recreational drug usage. There was no family history of prothrombotic disorders, and he did not have any prior investigation for prothrombotic disorders when he was diagnosed with an unprovoked deep venous thrombosis 2 years prior.\n\n【10】His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, with no acute ischaemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle with mild global impairment of left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction of 45%). Serial high-sensitivity troponin I levels were elevated (320 ng/l and 288 ng/l, normal < 20 ng/l). Serum biochemistry, renal and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was 6.5 mg/l (normal < 5.0 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm/hour (normal 2–25 mm/hour).\n\n【11】Coronary angiography revealed slow flow in the distal LAD artery suggestive of a coronary artery embolism ( Fig. 2 ). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated numerous foci of restricted diffusion, including two in the right parietal vertex and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere, consistent with embolic stroke ( Fig. 3 ). The intracranial cerebral arteries demonstrated normal flow and were of normal calibre. Suspecting an intracardiac source of embolism, the patient underwent transoesophageal echocardiography. This revealed a broad-based vegetation (14 mm at the base and 9 mm in thickness) attached to the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, with several frond-like mobile elements and moderate aortic valve regurgitation ( Fig. 4 ). There was no left atrial appendage thrombus. In the absence of septic features, NBTE was suspected. A procoagulant screen revealed strongly positive lupus anticoagulant tests (Russell’s viper venom and tissue thromboplastin inhibition) and elevated β2-glycoprotein antibodies (91 CU, normal 0–19). The patient had normal anti-cardiolipin IgM and IgG levels (<1 and 18 CU, respectively, normal 0–19 CU). Anti-nuclear antibody titre was positive (1:160; speckled and homogenous), but no other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus were present. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any evidence of malignancy nor pulmonary embolism. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was within normal limits (61 U/l, normal 20–70 U/l), although lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated (301 U/l, normal 120–250 U/l). Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation was normal, with no evidence of paraproteinaemia.\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Coronary angiogram (cranial view) demonstrating slow antegrade flow (incomplete filling) in the left anterior descending artery (red arrow) compared with normal opacification of the left circumflex artery (red asterisk), suggestive of coronary artery embolism.\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion weight imaging) demonstrating multi-territory foci of restricted diffusion, including two in the right parietal vertex ( **A** ) and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere ( **B** ), consistent with embolic stroke.\n\n【18】Figure 4\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Transoesophageal echocardiography: Long-axis views of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve in systole ( **A** ) and diastole ( **B** ) showing an echogenic mass in the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve (indicated by asterisk).

Despite the presence of atrial fibrillation, the left atrial appendage was free of thrombus.\n\n【21】The patient received intravenous unfractionated heparin. Because of the risks of recurrent systemic embolism, the patient underwent surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic aortic prosthesis. A small vegetation noted on the P2 scallop of the mitral valve was also carefully excised. Pulmonary vein cryoablation and amputation of the left atrial appendage was performed. Histological examination of the excised aortic valve revealed hypocellular fibrinous material with organizing thrombus, and no evidence of acute inflammation, consistent with NBTE. Bacterial cultures were negative. Histological and cytogenic examination of a sampled mediastinal lymph nodes did not demonstrate any features of sarcoidosis or lymphoproliferative disease. He was commenced on warfarin postoperatively (target INR 2.0–3.0). The patient made an excellent postoperative recovery and suffered no further thromboembolic events.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】APS is a hypercoagulable state associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic and embolic complications \\[ 4 \\]. This patient had recurrent venous thromboembolism as well as NBTE, complicated by embolic ischaemic stroke and coronary artery embolism. Antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to mediate valvular damage by promoting the formation of fibrin-platelet thrombi on altered valve surfaces, which results in NBTE, often appearing as verrucous lesions on left-sided heart valves \\[ 5 \\]. Whilst atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of systemic embolism, the absence of left atrial appendage thrombus and the presence of an aortic valve vegetation, suggests that his cardioembolic stroke was secondary to APS.\n\n【24】Unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin are recommended in the acute setting \\[ 3 \\], although the optimum long-term strategy is uncertain. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are less effective than warfarin in preventing recurrent thromboembolism in randomised-controlled trials \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. A recent meta-analysis of four studies comparing DOACs to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with APS demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis (odds ratio 5.17), no increased risk in venous thrombosis and no difference in risk of bleeding \\[ 8 \\]. VKAs remain the guideline-recommended treatment of choice in antiphospholipid syndrome, although current data do not specifically include patients with NBTE \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【25】The role of surgical valvular intervention is uncertain. Surgical valve replacement or vegetation excision with valvular repair may be performed for significant valvular dysfunction or to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. In a contemporary cohort study of 42 patients, 10 patients (24%) underwent cardiac surgery \\[ 1 \\] and 7 of them did not have a history of malignancy. The prognosis of patients who underwent cardiac surgery without a history of malignancy was found to be excellent, whereas 3 patients with cancer-related NBTE all died within 2 years of surgery.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】This case is exempt from ethics approval at our institution.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from this patient and is available for review upon request.\n\n【34】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【35】Dr Justin Phan.\n\n【36】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【37】The authors report no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is often associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies. Classical PG is characterized by painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined border, often developing at sites of injury because of the typical pathergy phenomenon. Because of its polymorphic presentation, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. We present a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a young female patient with ulcerative colitis. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG, to the best of our knowledge this is the first case precipitated by TENS. We report a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus and highlight the challenges that the diagnosis of this relatively rare pathology poses to the clinician.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis, a rare inflammatory disease affecting the skin \\[ 1 \\]. There are several types of PG, including classical (ulcerative), bullous, pustular, granulomatous superficial (vegetative), peristomal and post-surgical \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. The classical form is the most frequent presentation and occurs mainly on the lower extremities \\[ 1–3 \\]. Classical PG is characterized by the development of sterile inflammatory pustules, which expand into painful ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders \\[ 1–3 \\]. PG may occur in the absence of an underlying pathology, but in up to two-thirds of cases it is associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis or hematological malignancies \\[ 1–3 \\]. IBD is the most common comorbidity in younger PG patients \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. PG occurs in ~1–2% of IBD patients \\[ 4 \\]. Herein, we report a case of PG occurring after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 27-year-old woman was referred to our Burn Unit for the management of painful, progressive ulcers located on her legs. She had presented bilateral ankle tendinopathy 5 weeks earlier, for which she underwent TENS sessions (mild electrical currents were administered using electrode pads placed on the skin surface of the lateral and medial sides of both ankles). Following the fifth session, bluish-mauve swellings appeared on the left lateral and medial malleoli and on the right lateral malleolus, which ulcerated and extended despite topical cortisone. She reported no fever or systemic symptoms. Daily local bactericidal dressing and successive antibiotic therapies with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime and piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in the pejoration of the lesions. A computed-tomography scan of the ankles revealed infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue but no bone damage. As there was no improvement, she was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of infected electric burns. Detailed anamnesis revealed a 12-year-old history of UC, stable under mesalazine, not mentioned earlier. Physical examination on admission showed a large purplish ulcer of 16/7 cm, situated on the left lateral malleolus and two smaller ulcers on the left medial and right lateral malleoli ( Fig. 1 A–C). The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Biology tests were normal except for moderate normocytic hypochromic anemia and a C reactive protein value of 52.8 mg/l (normal range 0–5 mg/l). Immunological (rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies and HLA B27), serological tests (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Rickettsia and Leishmania), bacterial and fungal wound swabs and blood cultures were negative. Skin biopsies revealed a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils, with a site of deep abscedation, compatible with PG ( Fig. 2 A and B). Special stains (Periodic Acid Schiff, Wade-Fite, Ziehl-Neelsen and Gram) were negative for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Immunosuppressive treatment with high dose oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) followed by the addition of ciclosporin 1 month later, when steroid tapering began, combined with topical tacrolimus and adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy resulted in a favorable evolution, with complete resolution of the lesions and characteristic cribriform scars at 3.5 months ( Fig. 1 D–F).\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】**Panels A–C** : aspect of the wounds at referral to our Burn Unit ( **Panel A** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel B** : left leg, medial malleolus, **Panel C** : right leg, lateral malleolus). **Panels D–F** : follow-up at 3.5 months of treatment ( **Panel D** : left leg, lateral malleolus, **Panel E** : left leg, medial malleolus **Panel F** : right leg, lateral malleolus).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Hematoxylin–eosin stain, showing a dense polymorphic inflammatory dermal infiltrate, very rich in neutrophils ( **Panel A** : ×3,46 magnification, **Panel B** : ×20 magnification).\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】PG is the second most frequent dermatologic manifestation of IBD \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. It occurs mainly when the IBD is active but can also manifest during quiescent periods or precede the IBD diagnosis \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Because of its polymorphic presentation, frequent association with various systemic diseases and ability to imitate other conditions, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis are common in PG \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In our patient, lesions mimicked infected burn wounds, leading to misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and clinical deterioration. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by PG and the importance of thorough patient anamnesis, as the patient’s UC history first raised the suspicion of PG.\n\n【14】To this day, PG remains mainly a clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsies are recommended to exclude other causes of cutaneous ulceration. The histopathology of PG typically shows neutrophilic inflammation, but it is nonspecific (infections and other neutrophilic dermatosis may have similar findings) and can vary based on PG subtype, ulcer stage, timing and site of biopsy \\[ 7 \\]. To date there is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of PG. Su _et al._ proposed in 2004 a diagnostic tool for classical PG requiring two major and two minor criteria \\[ 8 \\], but in this algorithm PG remains an exclusion diagnosis, which can be impractical for clinical decision. In 2018, Maverakis _et al._ proposed new criteria based on the Delphi Consensus of International Experts, requiring one major and four minor criteria, and no longer rendering PG as a diagnosis of exclusion \\[ 7 \\]. More recently, Jockenhöfer _et al._ developed another diagnostic tool, the PARACELSUS score \\[ 9 \\]. Our patient met diagnostic criteria with each of the three above-mentioned scores.\n\n【15】There is no standardized treatment of PG \\[ 2–4 \\]. Topical treatment with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be tried in mild forms or those not associated with systemic disease. For systemic treatment, corticosteroids are first-line \\[ 2–4 \\]. Corticosteroids may be combined with immunomodulatory agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors or interleukin 1 inhibitors have been increasingly proposed in recent years \\[ 2–4 \\]. In addition, analgesia and wound care are two cornerstones of PG management. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be a helpful adjuvant.\n\n【16】PG lesions may be precipitated by minor traumas, a phenomenon known as ‘pathergy’. Because of this phenomenon, surgery is not recommended as it may worsen the lesions and delay the healing \\[ 4 \\]. Although electric current has previously been incriminated as a trigger for PG lesions—Ichikawa _et al._ described PG lesions appearing at the site of the grounding pad of an electric scalpel \\[ 10 \\]—this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of PG precipitated by TENS. We hypothesize that in this case the lesions were triggered by the electrical stimulus in a patient in which the underlying UC put her at a higher risk of developing PG.\n\n【17】In conclusion, we present a typical case of PG occurring after an unusual stimulus, while also highlighting the challenges that the diagnosis and management of this relatively rare pathology pose to the clinician.\n\n【18】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【19】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【20】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【21】The authors received no specific funding for this work.\n\n【22】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【23】Case reports are waived by the Ethics Committee of our institution.\n\n【24】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【25】The patient provided written consent for publication of the case report and accompanying images.\n\n【26】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【27】DI Costescu Strachinaru.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. It is rare as a primary splenic involvement and is usually reported as a second malignancy after hairy cell leukemia. Here, we report the first case that describes the occurrence of primary splenic T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma in a patient with a previous diagnosis of recurrent hairy cell leukemia. A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia in 1996 and achieved complete remission with Pentostatin. Then, recurrence of hairy cell leukemia was diagnosed in 2015 and treated with Cladribine. In 2016, he presented with B symptoms and hypersplenism. Therapeutic and diagnostic splenectomy was performed. Histopathological study with immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed the presence of T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, second malignancies should be considered in patients with a previous neoplasm when symptoms recur or develop.\n\n【2】BACKGROUND\n----------\n\n【3】Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic, low-grade malignant lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia cases \\[ 1–3 \\]. It is characterized by the accumulation of small, mature B-cells with abundant cytoplasm and hair-like cytoplasmic projections, with or without histiocytes within peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver and splenic red pulp \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. The incidence of second malignancies has increased in patients with hairy cell leukemia, either due to the disease itself or secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of the therapy \\[ 5 \\]. T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a high-grade, morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It constitutes 2–3% of all B-cell lymphomas \\[ 1 , 6 \\]. The primary occurrence of this subtype in the spleen is scarce. However, up to our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the development of primary splenic THRLBCL in a patient who was previously diagnosed with recurrent HCL.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in 1996 following symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections and easy bruising. Complete remission was achieved with Pentostatin. In 2015, he developed malaise, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow (75%), with focal infiltration by groups of large cells with clear eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei with perinuclear halos contain variable chromatin, and rare mitosis figures without prominent nucleoli were observed. There was a moderate increase in reticulin fibers ( Fig. 1 ). A mouse monoclonal IgG1 κ Hairy for the Dako immunohistochemistry was used. Bone marrow immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD20 and hairy cell antibodies \\[Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)\\] on large cells ( Fig. 2 ). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was negative. The histopathological picture and immunohistochemistry findings confirmed the relapse of HCL. We achieved complete remission with Cladribine. The patient continued to do well until June 2016, when he was admitted to our hospital with a history of B-symptoms. Vital signs were within normal range. Clinical examination revealed grade I in-depth and II in-extension lower limbs with edema and a palpable spleen, 12 cm below the costal edge. The patient could not afford the high cost of flow cytometry, so we used antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】The bone marrow biopsy sections reveal infiltration by a group of large cells contains clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear halo (arrow head). Nuclei with variable chromatin, rare mitosis figures and focal bone marrow fibrosis were observed. No prominent nucleoli were noticed (×100).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】The section of bone marrow shows positivity of Hairy cell antibody on large cells (Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)).\n\n【12】The patient was presumed to have a new relapse of HCL as the new bone marrow biopsy was normal. In addition, we found no plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, which excludes the blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia. An abdominal ultrasound showed a massive homogenous splenomegaly (26 × 16) cm. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral blood smear exhibited some anisocytosis with a few tear-shaped red cells and a significant decrease in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelet counts. Echocardiography exposed preserved Ejection Fraction (EF) and mild regurgitation in the mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves with no significant gradient. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray (CXR) were within normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed homogenous splenomegaly (26.3× 16) cm, without other abnormalities. We transferred the patient to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic splenectomy due to suspicion of hypersplenism and without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【13】Gross examination showed massive splenomegaly ( Fig. 3A ). The spleen was cut into two segments measuring (24× 9× 8) cm and (22× 9× 8.5) cm ( Fig. 3B ). Microscopic examination using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) revealed splenic tissue infiltrated by monoclonal, large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei ( Fig. 4 ). Immunohistochemistry evaluation results were positive for CD20 on large cells ( Fig. 5A ), CD3 on some of the background small lymphocytes ( Fig. 5B ), CD15 ( Fig. 5C ) and CD45. However, it was negative for CD30 and hairy cell staining. To exclude the possibility of blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia, we performed additional staining for Annexin A1 ( Fig. 6 ), TRAP ( Fig. 7 ) and CD103 ( Fig. 8 ) in a private histology laboratory, which all became negative. Staining for CD22 and CD25 was not available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103. These results confirmed the diagnosis of T-cell rich B cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematology-oncology department to receive chemotherapy. The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP. The patient had an uneventful follow-up until Feb 2021, when we lost the follow-up with him for unknown reasons.\n\n【14】Figure 3\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】A) gross examination reveals a huge splenomegaly.

HCL typically occurs in middle-aged men presenting with pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Morphologically, it is characterized by typical hairy cells with irregular, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cytoplasmic projections \\[ 7–10 \\]. HCL, hairy cell leukemia—variant (HCL-v) and splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma may have cytoplasmic projections. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate HCL from other diseases \\[ 10 \\]. HCL expresses TRAP and stains positive for annexin A1, cyclin D1, CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123. HCL also negatively stains CD5, CD23 and CD10 \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Although HCL-v could be TRAP-positive, CD25, cyclin D1 and annexin A1 are characteristically absent. Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (previously diagnosed as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes) lacks annexin A1, CD5, CD25, CD103 and CD11c \\[ 10 \\]. To exclude the blastic transformation of HCL in our case, we performed staining Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103, which all became negative. However, staining for CD22 and CD25 was not\n\n【34】available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103.\n\n【35】T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell Lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a new clinicopathological entity. It was first described in 1988. It constitutes almost 0.1% of all lymphomas. It is rare to encounter THRLBCL as a primary lymphoma in the spleen \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The WHO classification of lymphomas included THRLBCL as a specific histologic subtype of DLBCL; and reserved its diagnosis for cases in which the large B-cell component accounts for 10% or less of tumor cells, surrounded by a majority population of small polyclonal T cells, with or without histiocytes \\[ 1 \\]. The available knowledge about THRLBCL is scarce and mainly derived from published cases and case series. This subtype often has aggressive clinical behavior. Therefore, patients often present in advanced stages with splenomegaly and bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemical staining for B-cells is always positive for CD20 and CD45, whereas there is a rarity of the positivity of CD30. More than 50% of cases are positive for BCL-2 \\[ 11 \\]. The occurrence of a second malignancy with HCL synchronously or subsequently has been reported \\[ 12 \\]. The most extensive study on this topic reported second cancer among 3104 patients with HCL and concluded that patients with HCL are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia and thyroid cancer \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【36】Many theories were suggested to explain this phenomenon, the shared genetic predisposition, environmental exposure to carcinogens and immunosuppression \\[ 13 \\]. Pentostatin or cladribine remains the standard first-line treatment of HCL and could achieve cure rates of 70–90%. However, a complete cure with purine analog therapy is uncertain as patients are still at risk for relapse after an average of 15–16 years \\[ 7 \\]. On the other hand, Rituximab therapy showed cure rates of 10–54%, while a combination of purine analog and Rituximab could achieve cure rates of 88–100% \\[ 7 , 14 \\]. However, the latter is associated with increased immunosuppression, toxicities and second malignancies from purine analogs \\[ 7 , 13 \\]. Moreover, the splenectomy could worsen immunity and allow for mutations and subsequent transformation of HCL into a more severe neoplasm \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【37】The patient, in this case, has undergone diagnostic/therapeutic splenectomy due to splenic recurrence of HCL. Splenectomy is a well-described part of HCL treatment that helps to enhance hematologic parameters \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Surprisingly, the biopsy revealed the presence of THRLBCL as the malignancy in the spleen. Moreover, the flow cytometry came TRAP negative and HCL staining negative. However, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether the presence of TRCBCL was a coincidence or whether there is a causal relationship between the two malignancies. In our case, we rely on the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103 to exclude the blastic transformation of HCL.\n\n【38】In conclusion, hairy cell leukemia is an indolent, chronic lymphoproliferative malignancy. It is common to develop a second malignancy in this leukemia, attributed to several theories. However, THRLBCL is rare as primary splenic involvement and a second malignancy after HCL. Second malignancies should be considered, whether symptoms relapsed or new ones developed in patients who previously had neoplasm, especially HCL. However, we recommend close monitoring for early detection of possible new malignancies in HCL patients.\n\n【39】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【40】Pathology department for helping with sample analysis.\n\n【41】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【42】No conflict of interest.\n\n【43】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【44】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【45】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【46】This study was approved by Damascus University.\n\n【47】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【48】The patient provided written informed consent for publication of his clinical details and images.\n\n【49】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【50】HA and TA are the guarantor of this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although both demonstrate features of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads on the electrocardiogram (ECG), one must be distinguished from the other as their treatment options are different. We report a male patient who presented with recurrent syncope with a Brugada and a S1Q3T3 pattern on the ECG. Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) complicated by BrS was suspected. Twenty-four hours Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of an APE. He was treated with low molecular weight heparin and a repeat ECG taken the next day showed resolution of the Brugada and S1Q3T3 patterns. This case report illustrates that APE and BrS can present with similar clinical and electrocardiographic features of recurrent syncope and Brugada pattern, respectively.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The term Brugada phenocopy (BrP) has been coined to describe a group of heterogeneous conditions that induce Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns under the following circumstances of metabolism conditions, mechanical compression, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial and pericardial disease, ECG modulations and miscellaneous conditions \\[ 1 – 3 \\]. These conditions must be distinguished from true Brugada syndrome (BrS) as these are potential reversible causes. This case report illustrates that a patient can present with recurrent syncope associated with Brugada (ST-segment elevation in V1–V3) and S1Q3T3 patterns on the ECG. Co-existing BrS and acute pulmonary embolism (APE) were suspected. However, following prompt treatment of his PE, the patient recovered and the ECG Brugada and S1Q3T3 patterns disappeared.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension and varicose veins in lower limbs was admitted to the Department of Cardiology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University due to episodes of recurrent syncope. He reported four episodes of syncope per day but denied chest pain, dyspnea, cough or hemoptysis. On arrival, his blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg and had a temperature of 36.7°C, Cardiac auscultation revealed a normal S1, loud and split S2 in the absence of murmurs. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, a S1Q3T3 pattern, ‘coved’ ST-segment elevation (STE) with T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads V1–V3 (Fig. 1 A, trace). These findings were consistent of a Brugada pattern (Fig. 1 A). Blood tests revealed raised levels of troponin (0.094 ng/ml, normal range: 0–0.02 ng/ml), brain natriuretic peptide (2286.0 pg/ml, normal range: 0–100 pg/ml) and D-dimer (10.0 mg/l, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/l). Blood gas revealed pO <sub>2 </sub> of 64 mmHg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 28.7 mmHg and pH of 7.47. Echocardiography revealed thickened left ventricular septum to 11.9 mm, enlarged right heart (anteroposterior diameter and supra-inferior diameter of right atrium: 49.3 and 54.6 mm; right ventricular diastolic diameter: 29.8 mm) that were accompanied by mild tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery diameter of 27.3 mm. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest by tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient was estimated to be 51 mmHg ( Supplementary Video 1 ). The mitral _E_ / _A_ ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction took values of as 0.6 and 56%, respectively. Twenty-four hours Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. APE was highly suspected and this was confirmed by computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (Fig. 2 ). Oxygen and low molecular weight heparin were promptly initiated. ECG performed the next day showed ongoing ST elevation in leads V1 and V2 but resolution of the coved ST segment and T-wave inversion, and therefore disappearance of the Type 1 pattern (Fig. 1 B, trace). Eleven days after his admission, he recovered fully and was discharged home with warfarin.\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】( **A** ) A 12-lead ECG of a patient with APE showing sinus rhythm, a S1Q3T3 pattern, ‘coved’ STE with T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads V1–V3.

BrPs are clinical entities characterized by ECG patterns similar or identical to those of BrS, which are caused by underlying disorders such as metabolic disturbances, mechanical compression, ischemia, myocardial and pericardial diseases \\[ 9 – 14 \\]. BrP can be observed in patients with sub-massive to massive APE, with the latter being accompanied by hypotension and cardiogenic shock. In contrast to findings from previous case reports \\[ 15 – 19 \\], our patient presented with recurrent syncope without complaints of chest pain, dyspnea or hypotension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report regarding BrP in a case with APE with recurrent syncope. In BrS, ST segment changes can be intermittent. Therefore, it was possible, although less likely, that the patient suffered from a PE that precipitated a Type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG. Moreover, BrP needs to be distinguished from BrS to avoid missed or incorrect diagnosis, which often leads to unnecessary medical tests and treatment.\n\n【14】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【15】Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.\n\n【16】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】None declared.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】G.T. is supported by the Croucher Foundation.

He also reported night sweats and weight loss. Chest radiography at the previous hospital 2 weeks prior revealed no abnormalities ( Fig. 1a ). His vital signs at presentation were unremarkable with no fever. Chest auscultation revealed late inspiratory fine crackles in the basal area of the lungs. Repeated chest radiography revealed diffuse, bilateral and small lung nodules ( Fig. 1b ). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest revealed innumerable miliary nodules in both lungs. A sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) were negative. Subsequent two sputum AFB smears were also negative. Twelve days after presentation, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex was identified from one of the sputum samples, and the patient was diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis (TB). He was initiated on isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.\n\n【2】Figure 1\n\n【3】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【4】(a) Chest radiography performed 2 weeks prior to presentation.

The underlying mechanism of such pneumothoraxes is considered to be the result of the rupture of subpleural cystic spaces (bulla and bleb) related to diffuse interstitial fibrosis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【2】A 72-year-old man with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) was hospitalized with his first presentation of severe closed pneumothorax. He had suffered from severe pulmonary hypertension (PH, mean pulmonary artery pressure 72.6 mmHg). We inserted a chest tube (a thoracic catheter, double-lumen, 20Fr) from the left fourth intercostal on the midclavicular line. We monitored the pleural drainage for 1 week; however, the air leak continued. We were unable to perform surgery on this patient because of his severe PH. His CPFE was also contraindications for other stimulant pleurodeses such as OK-432 \\[ 1 \\]. Therefore, we tried to stop the air leak with autologous blood patch pleurodesis (ABPP) \\[ 3 \\], which is an alternative to surgery when conservative management is ineffective for treating a persistent air leak. This is obtained by instillating 100 ml of autologous blood through the chest tube, followed by clamping 1 hour \\[ 4 \\]. We repeated the chest X-ray every day to assess the state of pneumothorax.\n\n【3】After ABPP was performed three times in total with an interval of several days, the air leak stopped and we removed the chest tube. However, 7 days after removing the tube, his pneumothorax recurred. Chest computed tomography indicated that the large bullae in his lower lung lobe were ruptured. We placed a chest tube from his eighth intercostal on the midaxillary line, aiming for more precise chest tube placement over the large bullae ( Fig. 1a ).

The procedure and difficulties involved in the clinical diagnosis of ALS have been the subject of numerous investigations. The understanding of the genetics and the epigenetics of the disease is still at infancy with several missing links. We present a case report of a 73-year-old woman suffering from bulbar onset ALS with a 4-month history of progressive dysphagia and dyspnea. She displayed tongue fasciculations and muscle atrophy. The bilateral palmomental reflexes, snout reflex, Hoffman, Babinski, diminished gag reflex, bilateral clonus and wild mood swings confirmed the neurodegenerative condition of the patient. The diagnosis of ALS can be challenging; therefore, the data presented may be useful to investigate its characteristics of the onset and to improve the understanding of the aspects of differentiation from other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The neurological condition known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, or motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive condition that affects the nerve cells that regulate voluntary muscles \\[ 1 \\]. ALS is still considered one of the rare diseases and its incidence worldwide is 2.7–5 cases per 100 000 population annually. The patient’s growing weakening, manifested as muscular atrophy, hyperreflexia, fasciculations and muscle cramps, is the most striking feature of the disease. However, the sensory function remains unaffected \\[ 2 \\]. We describe a case of ALS presenting bulbar onset with neurodegeneration, dysarthria and dysphagia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension arrived at our neurology clinic complaining of speech difficulties and voice changes that had been going on for ⁓4 months. During the assessment, the patient displayed dysarthria and slurred speech. She had trouble swallowing both liquid and solid food and was constantly drooling. Her respiratory function was preserved. Upon examination, the patient displayed tongue fasciculations that were more noticeable on the left lateral side. The left hemibody showed more signs of atrophy in the thenar and hypothenar eminences, and the interosseous muscles of the hands. The biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris muscles both had clear fasciculations. The patient had a broad decline in muscle strength that scored 4/5 in the right hemibody and 3/5 in the left. The clinical examination revealed enhanced osteotendinous reflexes in the four limbs. The bilateral palmomental reflex was more pronounced on the left side. The patient also presented a snout reflex. In the left hemibody, Hoffman, Babinski and more obvious bilateral clonus were found. On pharyngeal examination, the gag reflex was not elicited, the left side palate was slightly dropped and the uvula showed deviation to the right. The differential and erythrocyte sedimentation rates on the hemogram were unaltered. Creatine phosphatase (CPK) measured 380 U/I. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) scans of the skull and spine revealed no abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord. Fibrillations, positive sharp waves and fasciculations were detected spontaneously by electromyography in the investigated muscles (biceps, pronator teres, spinal cord and tibialis anterior). The notching and enhanced polyphasic amplitude of the motor unit potentials were visible.\n\n【6】In the differential diagnosis, entities that affected the first and second motor neurons were assessed from compressive causes in the stem and spinal cord, intoxications, demyelinating diseases and primary lateral sclerosis. Cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF) showed an albumin-cytological dissociation with a protein of 151 mg/dl and the cell count of 2/mm <sup>3 </sup> . CSF oligoclonal band study was negative. Acetyl cholinesterase receptor antibodies and anti-muscle specific kinase antibodies were negative, ruling out the possibility of myasthenia gravis. The serological testing of cytomegalovirus using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) classes was negative. Thus diagnosis of bulbar onset ALS was made based on clinical, serological, CSF and electophysiological findings. The patient was put on symptomatic and supportive treatment with neuroprotective agents: Riluzol, Vitamin E and co-enzyme Q10. General measures were provided with gentle rehabilitation, amantadine and psychological support. At follow up visits, the patient had shown rapid functional deterioration and decline in life quality.\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】ALS, referred to as classic MND, impacts motor neurons on both the upper and lower limbs. Typical bulbar onset ALS patients develop progressive limb symptoms within first 6 months. Patients with a duration of >20 months from bulbar onset to first significant limb involvement are more likely to have isolated bulbar palsy (IBP) \\[ 3 \\]. Patients with bulbar onset ALS had poor prognosis and the disease course and survival time was significantly shorter. Early signs of bulbar onset ALS typically include bulbar muscles. Individuals gradually lose their strength, ability to speak, eat, move and even breathe, and practically all of the muscles they can control voluntarily become afflicted \\[ 4 \\]. Within 2–3 years for cases of bulbar onset ALS and 3–5 years for patients with limb onset ALS, the paralysis progresses and results in death due to respiratory failure. \\[ 5 \\]. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 55 and 75, while the disease can strike at any age \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【9】The patient in this case had both lower motor neuron (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) bulbar signs. While Karam et al \\[ 7 \\] found no evidence of a significant difference between UMN and LMN bulbar signs between the two groups, Burrel _et al_ . \\[ 6 \\] discovered that UMN bulbar signs were more prevalent in IBP.\n\n【10】ALS presents with significant clinical heterogeneity. The most common causes of diagnostic delays in ALS are frequent referrals to specialists, misdiagnosis, the location of disease onset, age at which it first manifests and comorbidities \\[ 4 \\]. The trait of female gender predominance in bulbar onset ALS suggests that genetic factors may be involved. Most ALS cases have been described as sporadic, and more research on the pathophysiology and genetic susceptibility of ALS is required.\n\n【11】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【12】None.\n\n【13】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【14】There is no conflict of interest.\n\n【15】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【16】None.\n\n【17】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【18】All the available data has been presented in the manuscript.\n\n【19】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【20】Not applicable.\n\n【21】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【22】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of the manuscript.\n\n【23】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【24】Ajay Singh.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The bronchoscopic removal of sharp metallic foreign bodies is technically challenging for the operating surgeon. We present a case of an 8-year-old girl who presented with an alleged history of aspiration of metallic, sharp and open safety pin 8 hours prior to presentation following which she developed throat pain and painful swallowing. X-ray of soft tissue neck showed a radio-opaque foreign body being lodged in the supraglottic area. She underwent emergency direct laryngoscopy-guided foreign body removal under general anesthesia. There was an open metallic sharp safety pin hinged over the inter-arytenoid region with its one end reaching sub-glottis and other end toward the hypopharynx. No post-operative complications occurred and patient was discharged on the third post-operative day.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A foreign body aspirated in the airway is a life-threatening condition, having a variable medical history, symptoms, peri-operative morbidities and prognosis. \\[ 1 \\] Although foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial tree are most frequent in children aged 1–3 years, they can occur at any age. Commonly aspirated foreign bodies include food, beads and metallic objects. \\[ 2 \\] Sometimes, unusual foreign bodies may get aspirated like broken tracheostomy tubes \\[ 3 \\], hypodermic needles, metallic nail \\[ 4 \\] and scarf pins \\[ 2 , 5 , 6 \\]. The clinical symptomatology may begin as soon as the foreign body is aspirated, which includes coughing, choking, stridor, excessive sputum production, cyanosis or shortness of breathing \\[ 2 \\]. It is not uncommon for patients to remain asymptomatic, who are at increased risk of developing dreadful complications, including death, due to delayed intervention. \\[ 2 , 6–8 \\].\n\n【4】Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice in management of pediatric airway foreign bodies. \\[ 1 \\] The airway is shared by the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, and hence, an excellent coordination between the two is of paramount importance. As the airway in children is of very small caliber, it warrants some degree of skill and composure to negotiate rigid bronchoscope and proceed with the manipulation and removal of foreign body. \\[ 9 \\] Utmost care is to be depicted when the surgeon is dealing with a sharp metallic foreign body in the airway as its removal can be tedious with significant post-operative complications. Herein, we present a case of a female child with sharp metallic foreign body in the airway who underwent an uncomplicated direct laryngoscopy-guided foreign body removal within hours of aspiration.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 8-year-old female child from a remote village in the eastern Nepal presented to pediatric emergency unit of our institute with alleged history of aspiration of safety pin 8 hours back. She accidentally aspirated the safety pin while she kept the pin in between her lips when she was getting dressed. Immediately following aspiration, she developed a cough and one episode of blood-mixed vomiting. She also developed pain on swallowing but there was no cyanosis, stridor, shortness of breath and excessive sputum production. Her mother rushed her to a regional tertiary center where she was assessed and an X-ray soft tissue neck was ordered, which showed a radio-opaque foreign body in the upper airway. She was then referred to our center.\n\n【7】On clinical examination, the child was comfortable with no cyanosis, labored breathing or stridor. On examination of neck, anterior neck tenderness could be elicited at the level of cricoid cartilage. On auscultation of chest, there was bilateral normal vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds. Her vitals, including oxygen saturation, were within normal limits ( Fig. 1 ). We repeated her X-ray soft tissue neck which showed a radio-opaque foreign body (open safety pin) with its blunt end superiorly and its two open ends directed inferiorly ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Clinical condition of an 8-year-old girl at the time of presentation.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】X-ray soft tissue neck: anteroposterior and lateral view showing the foreign body (open safety pin).\n\n【14】After detailed preoperative evaluation, emergency rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal under general anesthesia was planned. Careful planning and anticipation of untoward events were discussed by the ear, nose, throat consultant and anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist proceeded with induction of anesthesia followed by jet ventilation. Direct laryngoscopy using optical laryngoscope was performed initially. The foreign body was visualized and it was an open, sharp metallic safety pin that was hinged over the inter-arytenoid region with its blunt end and its other two ends lying at hypopharynx and sub-glottis. Under direct laryngoscopy guidance, foreign body removal forceps was inserted and the foreign body was removed ( Fig. 3 ). Following its removal, check bronchoscopy was done that revealed mild sub-glottic edema and minimal laceration in hypopharynx at the site of impingement of foreign body’s sharp end. No intraoperative complication was noted and the child was shifted to the ward after 4 hours of observation in the post-operative recovery room. A post-operative X-ray soft tissue neck was obtained, which was normal ( Fig. 4 ).\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Foreign body (safety pin) removed in toto.\n\n【18】Figure 4\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Post-operative X-ray soft tissue neck anteroposterior and lateral view showing no residual foreign body.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Accidental inhalation of sharp metallic foreign bodies in children can present with variable symptomatology or no symptoms at all \\[ 2 , 5 , 6 , 10 \\]. Our patient presented with throat pain, dysphagia and anterior neck tenderness owing to the unusual lodgment of open metallic safety pin with its open sharp end toward the sub-glottis and hypopharynx. She had no alarming symptoms due to minimal obstruction of the airway by the foreign body itself and insignificant airway edema.\n\n【23】Although positive predictive accuracy of clinical diagnosis is 74.2% \\[ 8 \\], X-ray soft tissue neck is a valuable tool to diagnose radio-opaque airway foreign body like metallic safety pins \\[ 7 \\]. Therefore, clinico-radiological diagnosis was made in our patient. Rigid bronchoscopy is a widely used modality of removal of airway foreign bodies in children owing to its safety, excellent visualization and provision for continuous ventilation of the patient \\[ 5 \\]. We also planned for rigid bronchoscopy in our patient, but the passage of rigid bronchoscope was restricted by the size of the airway of the patient and unusual location of the foreign body. Hence, an optical direct laryngoscopy was used to visualize the foreign body, and its removal was done by grasping with forceps. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed to check for any remaining part of the foreign body and injuries caused by the lodgment of foreign body. Hence, it is imperative to have a detailed discussion of procedural plan between the surgeon and anesthesiologist for a satisfactory outcome of the procedure \\[ 9 \\]. Our patient had an uneventful post-operative outcome, which highlights the importance of early presentation and prompt surgical intervention in the management of airway foreign bodies in children.\n\n【24】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【25】We would like thank the Department of ENT Head and Neck Surgery and the Department of Anesthesiology for helping to publish this article.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】None declared.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】There is no source of funding for this report.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】Ethical approval is waived for this study.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Written consent has been obtained from the patient’s legal guardian (mother).\n\n【34】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【35】Dr Milan Sedhai MBBS (corresponding author).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, it had recently begun to increase in size. On examination, it was elastic, soft and blanched on compression ( Fig. 1B ). Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography findings confirmed a diagnosis of haemangioma. The mass was resected under general anaesthesia, and no recurrence was noted at 3 years post-operatively.\n\n【1】Figure 1\n\n【2】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【3】(A) Intraoral findings: a well-defined, dark purple mass is present on the right tongue margin, and (B) light pressure with a glass slide sweeps the blood inside, and the mass changes from dark purple to white.\n\n【4】A haemangioma is an abnormal growth of a blood vessel. In most cases, it is a hamartoma. Histopathologically, there are various types of haemangiomas \\[ 1 \\]. Haemangiomas in the oral maxillofacial region are commonly capillary or cavernous haemangiomas \\[ 2 \\]. Superficial haemangiomas are characterized by blanching \\[ 3 \\]. Therefore, applying light pressure with an examining finger or a glass slide can assist in the diagnosis. This simple test is extremely safe, and the pressure exerted does not cause pain or bleeding. The fading of the colour can be assessed by applying light pressure. A cold slide glass may be unpleasant to the patient, which can be prevented by warming it to body temperature between the examiner’s fingers. Imaging is also used for diagnosis, but biopsy should be avoided because of the risk of haemorrhage \\[ 4 \\]. Treatment includes surgical excision, packing therapy, cryotherapy, laser irradiation and electrical coagulation, and the choice of treatment is based on the site of occurrence, size of the tumour and patient’s health status \\[ 1 \\]. If there are no symptoms or risk of haemorrhage from trauma, it is acceptable to monitor the lesion without intervention. In this case, the patient had a haemangioma on the lateral margin of the tongue and was at risk of massive bleeding from traumatic mastication. She required resection under general anaesthesia. Previous case reports have demonstrated the risk of haemorrhage during tongue haemangioma excision \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, post-operative swelling may obstruct the airway \\[ 6 \\].

These devices have helped in preventing problems associated with fecal incontinence. Although highly efficient, these devices can also lead to certain complications including rectal ulcer and lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Here, we report a case of a 56-year-old male being treated for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation, who had significant lower GI bleed while being on FMS for stool incontinence. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed multiple rectal ulcers with one large ulcer having a visible pulsating vessel. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of rectal ulcers and GI bleed associated with use of FMS.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fecal incontinence remains a common and difficult problem for hospitalized patients. It is reported in ⁓50% of patients admitted to hospitals and long care facilities \\[ 1 \\]. It can occur in both sexes and patients of all ages. Managing critically ill patients with diarrhea or fecal incontinence is a challenge as it can lead to infections, skin breakdown and ulcerations \\[ 2 \\] Several solutions for fecal incontinence existed including medications such as loperamide and opiate, products such as absorbent pads, rectal foley catheters, artificial sphincters, even colostomy \\[ 3 \\]. In the past decade, several fecal management systems (FMSs) have been introduced to deal with diarrhea and incontinence, especially in immobile and critically ill patients. These systems have helped in reducing perianal skin excoriation, infection spread and the overall nursing requirements. Despite the effectiveness and a high safety profile of these devices, there have been reports of adverse events in the published literature. These complications result mostly from pressure injury or traumatic device removal; and may include rectal ulcer, fissures and major traumatic rectal bleed. Here, we present a case of 56-year-old male who had major lower Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as result of rectal ulcers from FMS use.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old male with extensive past medical history including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), intracranial bleed from aneurysm rupture, on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, who presented with complain of shortness of breath. Patient was started on treatment for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. While in the hospital the patient became obtunded and was intubated for airway protection. Patient was upgraded to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.\n\n【6】While in the MICU patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation and was started on a heparin drip. Patient also was found to have fecal incontinence and a Dignishield FMS was placed. In 2 days after placement of rectal tube, patient had an episode of hematochezia that was small in amount. Heparin was put on hold and hemoglobin was closely monitored. Three days later patient had another large episode of hematochezia, with ⁓150 mL of blood loss and visible clots resulting in hemodynamic instability. Code fusion was initiated and patient was adequately resuscitated with blood transfusion and intravenous fluids. A computed tomographic angiography didn’t reveal any active bleed in the GI tract. Gastroenterology service was consulted who performed an urgent upper endoscopy to rule out any upper GI bleed. The upper endoscopy failed to reveal any bleeding source.\n\n【7】Patient then had bowel prep with polyethylene glycol and underwent colonoscopy the next day. Colonoscopy revealed multiple superficial rectal ulcerations varying in size ( Fig. 1 ). It also showed one large deep ulcer, 2 cm in size, was seen in the rectum with a pulsating visible vessel in ulcer base ( Fig. 2 ), 3 mL of diluted epinephrine (1:10 000) was injected in ulcer base followed by application of three endoclips to the ulcer with adequate hemostasis. This patient had a previous screening colonoscopy 1 year prior that was negative for any rectal ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】White arrows shows multiple rectal ulcers.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】White arrow shows ulcer closure with endoclips.\n\n【14】The rectal tube was discontinued after these findings. Patient was also started on daily polyethylene glycol to avoid constipation. He completed his course of treatment without any further bleeding and was eventually discharged from the hospital.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Fecal incontinence is the involuntary recurrent passage of stool. Its more commonly seen in patients with advance age, multiparous women, history of obstetric complications and those with anorectal disease or surgery. The availability of FMS provides effective management for fecal incontinence in patients of both short and long care facilities.\n\n【17】Currently there are three main FMSs available in the United States; these includes Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec); Bowel Management System (Hollister) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard). All these FMS have a catheter with an inflatable balloon on one end, which keeps the catheter from being dislodged from the rectum; on the other end of the catheter is an external collection bag for stool collection.\n\n【18】There are potential complications associated with the use of a FMS, these can include loss of anal sphincter muscle tone, infection, abdominal distention, bowel obstruction and perforation, ulcers and rectal bleeding \\[ 4 \\]. Our Patient also developed rectal ulcer with severe GI bleed. The mechanism by which these ulcers develop is due to pressure injury caused by the inflatable balloon. In addition, the buildup of stool above the catheter may also contribute to pressure on the bowel wall resulting in necrosis. This follows similar mechanism as seen in stercoral perforation due large stool burden in severely constipated patients. \\[ 5 \\]. Both major brands i.e. Flexi-Seal FMS (ConvaTec) and DigniCare Stool Management System (Bard) recommend inflating the cuff with 45 mL of tap water and to discontinue use after 29 days. All the patient reported in literature developed bleeding complications between day 3 to 3 weeks post insertion \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Review of literature shows ⁓14 cases reporting rectal bleed in patients on these stool management systems. In five of these case \\[ 6 , 8–11 \\] the patients were on therapeutic dose of heparin, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. This was also the case in our patient who was on therapeutic dose heparin for atrial fibrillation. Although no studies are available that discuss association between anticoagulation use and ulcer bleed in these patients, both the cases reported in the literature and our case, should keep physicians cautious about severe bleed from rectal ulcer in patients using FMS while on anticoagulation.\n\n【19】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【20】Our case highlights the fact that FMS although safe can have severe complications. Ulcer formation occurs as a result of pressure injury from these devices that employ an inflatable cuff mechanism. Also, physicians need to be cautious when using these devices in patient on anticoagulation and should reassess the need for these catheters every few days.\n\n【21】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【22】Not applicable.\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【24】None declared.\n\n【25】AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------\n\n【26】Muhammad Haider (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Madiha Fatima Master (Prepared, reviewed and edited the manuscript), Muhammad Master (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Evelina Khalilova (Reviewed and edited the manuscript/figures), Maga Daoud (Reviewed and edited the manuscript) and Jay Nfonoyim (Reviewed and edited the manuscript)\n\n【27】DISCLOSURES\n-----------\n\n【28】The authors have nothing to disclose.\n\n【29】COMPETING INTERESTS\n-------------------\n\n【30】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【31】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【32】No financial support.\n\n【33】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【34】Ethical approval not required.\n\n【35】DATE AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【36】The corresponding author may be reached out for clinical data.\n\n【37】CONSENT STATEMENT\n-----------------\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent policy.\n\n【39】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【40】Muhammad Haider.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This syndrome may affect the autonomic nervous system, in which case it is called a 4A syndrome. It is a rare autosomal recessive inheritance, and early identification is difficult due to the rarity and wide phenotypic variation even among members of the same family. Endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists and surgeons are needed to coordinate care for these patients. We describe a case of AS that took several years to complete the diagnosis. She was diagnosed with alacrima at the age of 1-year-old, adrenal insufficiency at the age of 9 and achalasia at the age of 16. This case demonstrates the difficulty and delay in the diagnosis of AS.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Allgrove syndrome (AS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is a multi-system disease first described in 1978 and characterized by the triad of alacrima, adrenal insufficiency and esophageal achalasia. Recognizing the clinical syndrome at the onset of the disease is difficult when there is only one presenting symptom and many diseases as a differential diagnosis. The presence of two cardinal clinical entities strongly suggests the diagnosis \\[ 1 \\]. Neurological and dermatological manifestations have been reported, as well as short stature, microcephaly, osteoporosis and dysmorphic features \\[ 2 \\]. We present an interesting case of AS that took several years to diagnose. She was diagnosed with alacrima at the age of 1-year-old, adrenal insufficiency at the age of 9 and achalasia at age of 16, which complete the syndrome trilogy. Although alacrima is an uncommon symptom, and that the adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed, doctors and other health care providers were unaware of AS.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 16-year-old Syrian girl was referred for evaluation due to short stature, progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids and a nocturnal cough that started several months ago. She had been diagnosed with alacrima since she was 1-year old, which was followed by adrenal insufficiency when she was 7 years old, confirmed by a review of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. Her weight was 28 kg, her height was 125 cm and she had a body mass index of 17.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and a body surface area of 0.986 m <sup>2 </sup> . Her mother informed us that she has three other short-statured children with alacrima. Furthermore, she had been treated with prednisolone 10 mg for 7 years for her adrenal insufficiency, her clinical examination was normal except for her low weight and short stature and her laboratory tests were normal. A gastroduodenoscopy revealed puckering of the gastroesophageal junction, requiring more pressure to traverse than the usual ( Fig. 1 ). A barium esophagram/swallow revealed a dilated esophagus with a bird-breaking ( Fig. 2 ). Manometry was characterized by a complete absence of peristalsis in the esophageal body and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which had a pressure of 73 mm/Hg. As a result, she was diagnosed with achalasia, which completes the manifestations of AS. The child’s parents initially declined any therapeutic intervention. We adequately explained that both dysphagia and growth failure are irreversible unless she is managed appropriately. We started treatment with oral hydrocortisone (10 and 5 mg taken in the morning and noon) and nifedipine (1.5 mg/kg t.i.d). She continues to suffer from intermittent episodes of vomiting and a persisting failure to thrive. We advised her to eat small, low-fiber meals with more liquid, beside vitamin and mineral supplementation.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Puckering of the gastroesophageal junction necessitating more pressure than usual to traverse.\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Bird’s beak deformity and a dilatation of the body of the esophagus.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】AS is a rare disorder with a prevalence of 10 cases per 100 000 people \\[ 3 \\]. Alacrima is the most common early presenting sign occurring at birth or within the first year of life, but its significance is often overlooked, and attention is not sought until other symptoms emerge \\[ 2 \\]. Schirmer’s test confirms alacrima and each artificial tears, and lubricants can help in the treatment. If left untreated, it can cause keratopathy and corneal ulceration \\[ 2 \\]. Glucocorticoid secretion affects up to 85% of patients, most of whom are in their first or, less frequently, the second decade of life. It is the leading cause of death due to severe hypoglycemia and can manifest as a variety of symptoms such as recurrent vomiting, hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, or developmental delays \\[ 2 \\]. Cortisol levels at 8 a.m. along with concomitant ACTH measurements are used for confirming the diagnosis \\[ 2 \\]. The preferred treatment is a short-acting glucocorticoid such as oral hydrocortisone, with 15–25 mg daily. For patients weighing less than 65 kg, a morning dose of 10 mg and a noon dose of 5 mg, or three doses of 10, 5 and 2.5 mg taken in the morning, noon and afternoon, respectively. Under-replacement symptoms such as myalgia, weight loss, nausea, fatigue, lack of energy and over-replacement symptoms such as central obesity, weight gain, hypertension, stretch marks, osteoporosis, osteopenia and impaired glucose tolerance must be identified \\[ 4 \\]. Achalasia pathophysiology is characterized by failure to relax the lower esophageal sphincter and loss of esophageal peristaltic movement \\[ 5 \\]. Gastroduodenoscopy, barium esophagram/barium swallow and esophageal manometry are well-established and complementary tests for the diagnosis of achalasia \\[ 6 \\], and symptoms most commonly include regurgitation, dysphagia, weight loss and failure to thrive \\[ 7 \\]. In up to 40% of cases, achalasia may also be accompanied by pulmonary symptoms such as cough, aspiration, hoarseness, dyspnea, wheezing or sore throat \\[ 8 \\]. Achalasia in AS is distinguished by a more severe progression and a higher rate of treatment failure \\[ 9 \\]. Treatment options include pneumatic dilation, which is the most effective non-surgical treatment option, laparoscopic Heller myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy \\[ 6 \\]. To avoid pre-operative crisis, pre-operative measures should focus on preventing adrenal insufficiency and managing it with a stress dose of glucocorticoids on the morning of the procedure, while long procedures may necessitate continuous glucocorticoid infusion in the operating room. Blood glucose levels should be monitored throughout the procedure, as steroid administration may result in significant hyperglycemia, necessitating the administration of insulin. Hemodynamic stability in patients with impaired autonomic responses may be fragile, necessitating close cardiopulmonary monitoring for hypotension and arrhythmias, as well as caution during induction and position changes. To avoid keratopathy and corneal ulcers, eye protection in the form of lubrication should be provided \\[ 10 \\]. Early identification of patients with suspected symptoms through genetic confirmation may allow proper monitoring and treatment \\[ 2 \\]. The challenging conditions in Syria made it difficult for her to get appropriate medical consultation. Despite the long period of glucocorticoids treatment, the investigation of osteoporosis and opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis, was neglected.\n\n【14】AS can manifest in a variety of ways in timing, age of onset and coexisting disorders. This case demonstrates the difficulty and delay in diagnosis because the characteristic triad may not manifest concurrently. Although AS is uncommon, having a child present with a red-flag symptom such as alacrima should warrant further investigation.\n\n【15】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【16】None to declare.\n\n【17】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【18】None to declare.\n\n【19】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【20】None to declare.\n\n【21】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【22】This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee.\n\n【23】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【24】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images.

Morbidity and mortality most commonly occur secondary to pump failure or ventricular arrhythmias; however, a more infrequently seen complication is the formation of mural thrombi. More commonly seen within the left ventricle, thrombi can embolize leading to stroke or end organ infarction. We present the case of a male who presented with decompensated heart failure. The presence of biventricular thrombi was found on echocardiography and subsequent cross-sectional imaging revealed these had embolized resulting in the rare complication of extensive abdominal aortic thrombosis with renal and testicular infarction. Biventricular thrombi are rare but high risk due to the potential for embolization as demonstrated in this case. Prompt recognition and management with anti-coagulation are essential, followed by treatment of the underlying pathology, which resulted in the formation of thrombi to prevent recurrence.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heart failure is an epidemic resulting in significant health care expenditure and morbidity for patients. Mural thrombus is a rare complication most commonly seen in the left ventricle (LV) following anterior myocardial infarction. Biventricular thrombi have been infrequently described; we present a case of biventricular thrombi resulting in extensive embolization and end organ infarction.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male smoker presented with exertional dyspnoea and scrotal swelling, without testicular pain, on a background of hypertension and excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was consistent with decompensated heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure, anasarca, peripheral and scrotal oedema.\n\n【6】Initial blood tests revealed an N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level of 27 594 pg/ml (<400 pg/ml) with deranged liver and renal biochemistry including an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 2266 u/l (<50 u/l) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 35 ml/min (>90 ml/min). Echocardiogram confirmed LV systolic impairment with an ejection fraction of 10%, moderately dilated LV and right ventricular (RV) cavities and severe functional mitral regurgitation. In addition, apical thromboses were present in the LV and RV ( Fig. 1 , Video 1 and Video 2 ).\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Transthoracic echocardiogram. ( **a** ) Focused RV view with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow). ( **b** ) Two-chamber view of the LV with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow).\n\n【10】Given the presentation of gross peripheral oedema, scrotal oedema and deranged ALT, a post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude metastatic disease, specifically liver metastases. The CT study confirmed biventricular dilatation and apical thromboses ( Fig. 2a ). No evidence of malignancy or metastatic disease was demonstrated; however, important incidental findings included extensive occlusive abdominal aortic thrombus, which extended from the level of the superior mesenteric artery into the distal external iliac arteries where there was re-opacification of the vessels ( Fig. 2b ).\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】( **a** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT chest demonstrating biventricular apical thrombi (white arrow—RV thrombus, black arrow—left ventricular thrombus). ( **b** ) Coronal contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating extensive occlusive thrombus within the abdominal aorta ( <sup>* </sup> ). ( **c** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the left kidney in keeping with infarction (Arrow). ( **d** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally in keeping with infarction ( <sup>* </sup> ).\n\n【14】The left renal artery was completely occluded with reduced enhancement of the left kidney, consistent with infarction ( Fig. 2c ). The inferior mesenteric artery was also occluded at its origin although there was distal opacification and normal mucosal enhancement of the colon was preserved. In addition, there was reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally with occlusion of the testicular arteries ( Fig. 2d ).\n\n【15】Given the history of excessive alcohol consumption, this was presumed to be the most likely aetiology of the patient’s heart failure which subsequently resulted in the formation of biventricular thrombi leading to embolic extensive aortic thrombosis. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was deemed unlikely given the absence of anginal symptoms or ischaemic electrocardiogram changes. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy would be an alternative differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation. An underlying thrombophilia such as anti-phospholipid syndrome accounting for the multiple sites of arterial thrombosis was considered; however, a thrombophilia screen was negative.\n\n【16】A multifaceted management approach to this patient initially included treatment of heart failure with intravenous furosemide infusion and commencement of ramipril. His heart failure medications were further optimized with the addition of eplerenone and ivabradine with good symptomatic benefit. The patient was strongly encouraged to cease further alcohol consumption.\n\n【17】With regards to the extensive aortic thrombosis, a surgical approach was deemed prohibitively high risk given the patient’s poor cardiac function. A percutaneous thrombectomy via the femoral approach was attempted but was unsuccessful, and therefore the patient was managed conservatively with a heparin infusion and subsequently converted to warfarin.\n\n【18】Serum testosterone levels were found to be low at 1.3 nmol/L (7–26 nmol/L) due to testicular infarction, and therefore replacement was commenced. Following improvement in symptoms and renal and liver biochemistry, the patient was discharged on oral diuretics and long-term warfarin therapy with an INR target of 2–3 in keeping with guideline recommendations \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【19】Follow-up.\n\n【20】The patient developed sepsis |$\\\\sim$| 2 months following the initial presentation, from the right femoral access site which was persistently discharging following the previous attempt at femoral thrombectomy. A post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis study was performed to exclude other potential sources of sepsis, confirmed a right groin collection. There was persistent extensive aortic occlusive thrombus as seen previously; however, there was evidence of new collateralization from rectus abdominis and paraspinal arteries filling the external iliac and femoral arteries. The biventricular thrombi had resolved and there was no evidence of propagation of the aortic thrombus or new arterial thrombosis.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】The formation of LV thrombus in the context of cardiomyopathy with LV impairment and reduced ejection fraction is well-documented; however, biventricular thrombosis is a rarer occurrence complicating up to 23.9% of LV thrombi \\[ 2 \\]. Biventricular thrombi have been previously reported in the literature complicating acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism \\[ 2–4 \\]. The proposed mechanism for ventricular thrombus formation in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy, as in this case, is blood stasis secondary to cavity dilatation and hypokinesis. A hypercoagulable state can also predispose to the formation of biventricular thrombi including conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. A thrombophilia screen should therefore be performed as part of the investigation for biventricular thrombi.\n\n【23】Complications of biventricular thrombi include systemic and pulmonary embolization which can result in significant end-organ damage such as pulmonary emboli, stroke, acute limb ischaemia and visceral ischaemia. Contemporary data suggest an annualized embolism rate of 3.7% despite treatment with anti-coagulation \\[ 5 \\]. Ventricular thrombi complicated by such extensive aortic thrombus have not previously been reported in the literature to our knowledge. There was evidence of end-organ damage with left renal infarct and bilateral testicular infarcts. No pulmonary emboli were demonstrated in this case.\n\n【24】A high index of suspicion is required when predisposing factors for the formation of ventricular thrombi exist such as apical hypokinesia particularly following a large anterior myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial investigation of choice and has 35–60% sensitivity and 90% specificity for LV thrombus detection. Although CT has similar detection rates to TTE, delayed enhancement cardiac MRI is the gold standard for LV thrombus detection with 88% sensitivity and 99% specificity \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【25】There are no guideline recommendations for the treatment of biventricular thrombus. In practice, patients are treated with low molecular weight heparin before being established on oral anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only approved oral anticoagulant for LV thrombus; however, emerging evidence suggests direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in selected patients \\[ 7 \\]. Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for up to 6 months for treatment of LV thrombus, with duration guided by surveillance TTE and consideration of bleeding risk \\[ 8 \\]. Thrombolysis remains a treatment option, however carries a risk of catastrophic embolization \\[ 3 \\]. Thrombectomy should be considered in patients with a larger, more mobile thrombi which carry an increased risk of embolization \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【26】Conservative management in the present case with warfarin resulted in the resolution of ventricular thrombi; however, due to persisting aortic thrombus, the decision was made to continue long-term anti-coagulation.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【28】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】There were no sources of funding associated with this case report.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】No ethical approval was required for this case report.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】Written patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.\n\n【35】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【36】Dr Saad Ezad.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This report presents the first case of complete resolution of GMPC following a 3-year course of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist alongside external beam radiotherapy for the concurrent treatment of unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. In addition to illustrating the imaging features of the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy on GMPC regression, this case provides evidence for considering ADT as an alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment option in patients in whom surgical treatment is either contraindicated or can be made less invasive by reducing the size of GMPC prior to its removal.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Giant multilocular prostatic cystadenoma (GMPC) is a rare benign tumor with <30 cases reported in literature \\[ 1 \\] since its first description by Maluf _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] in 1991. GMPC often manifests with obstructive urinary symptoms, urinary retention or pelvic pain. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice, however, not all patients are suitable for a surgical intervention, thereby presenting a case for alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment options. In this report, we present the first case of a patient in whom GMPC was concurrently diagnosed with an unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), with both lesions showing complete resolution following a 3-year course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old male was referred to our center for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion for localized PCa with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 8.0 ng/ml. The biopsy revealed the presence of a Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 mixed ductal and acinar carcinoma of the prostate in 3/3 cores in the left base, which was later correlated to a 17 × 7 × 15 mm (0.96 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) PI-RADS 5 lesion on staging multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate **(** Fig. 1 **)** . mpMRI also demonstrated a multiloculated cystic lesion arising from the prostatic base and extending into the bladder, measuring 72 × 41 × 53 mm (81.9 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **(** Fig. 2 **)** . On the right side, the locules were of intermediate T2 signal with areas of restricted diffusion, likely relating to blood products. On the left side, the locules showed higher T2 signal with no restricted diffusion, and areas of low T1 or high T1 signal intensity, likely relating to either simple fluid or proteinaceous material, respectively. No imaging features of local invasion were observed, with the described radiological appearance being in keeping with GMPC. A subsequent flexible cystoscopy showed no invasion of the mass into the bladder, and no malignant cells were seen on diagnostic cytology. The patient was prescribed an LHRH agonist with a 3-month interval MRI demonstrating a significant reduction in size of GMPC, then measuring 43 × 29 × 40 mm (26.1 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **(** Fig. 3 **)** . The previously noted lesion in the left prostatic peripheral zone also appeared less prominent, measuring 11 × 4 × 9 mm (0.20 cm <sup>3 </sup> ). Following 6 months of ADT, the patient underwent hypofractionated EBRT with 60 Gy delivered over 20 treatment sessions. No MRI was performed immediately post-EBRT, however, the EBRT planning CT scan demonstrated even further reduction of GMPC, making it virtually undetectable **(** Fig. 4 **)** . Following EBRT, the patient continued on LHRH agonist for a further 2 years with his PSA remaining < 0.04 ng/ml. A routine surveillance MRI scan, performed more than three and a half years after initial treatment, showed complete regression of both GMPC and the previously identified left peripheral zone lesion, with the final gland volume being 10.6 cm <sup>3 </sup> **(** Fig. 3 **)** .\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Axial T2WI (a) and diffusion-weighted imaging (b), alongside apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping (c) of the pelvis.

No suspicious mass protruding into the urinary bladder was convincingly visible on anatomical imaging (a). The patient received intensity-modulated radiation therapy using 60 Gy Prostate (red 95% isodose) and 48Gy seminal vesicles (yellow 95% isodose) delivered over 20 sessions with daily image guidance (b).\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete regression of a GMPC following a three-year course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with EBRT for organ-confined PCa. The 4-fold reduction in the GMPC volume reported after the initial 3-month ADT, alongside its further reduction seen on EBRT computed tomography (CT) planning scan, highlight the key role of castration in the observed phenomenon, likely driven by targeting the androgen receptor, which is known to be expressed on GMPC cells \\[ 1 \\]. These findings are in line with the single published report of noninvasive treatment of recurrent unresectable GMPC with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist \\[ 3 \\], which also demonstrated a positive result, with no further recurrence observed on continuous ADT. In the present report, interim EBRT could also have an add-on effect on GMPC resolution, e.g. by means of destroying its feeding vessel. Overall, these findings suggest that ADT is effective in treating both primary and recurrent GMPC, thereby serving as a promising alternative to invasive surgical treatment.\n\n【20】GMPC can be diagnosed at any age between 16 and 80 \\[ 1 \\], with its presenting symptoms being similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including lower urinary symptoms, urinary retention, hematuria and elevated serum PSA levels. Radiologically, GMPCs present as large retroperitoneal masses located between the bladder and rectum, showing multilocular cavities and cysts of various sizes. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging may provide additional information on the presence and the nature of any GMPC soft tissue components \\[ 4 \\]. Being aware of radiological features of GMPC, alongside other pelvic masses or congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract, is of considerable clinical relevance given the increasing use of MRI for diagnosis, local staging and follow-up imaging of PCa, which may lead to a more frequent incidental detection of this rare condition \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Additionally, to our knowledge, the concomitant diagnosis of GMPC and biopsy-proven PCa demonstrated in this report has not been presented previously.\n\n【21】As there are no pathognomonic histopathological signs of GMPC that could enable its confident diagnosis by biopsy \\[ 7 \\], it is important to consider several differential diagnoses that include other lower male genitourinary tract cysts (Müllerian, prostatic, seminal vesicle and utricle), prostatic leiomyoma, lymphangioma, teratoma, liposarcoma, hydatid disease and phyllodes variant of atypical prostatic hyperplasia \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【22】Given the size and possible adherence to surrounding organs, complete surgical excision of GMPC, which is required to prevent the disease recurrence \\[ 1 , 2 \\], often becomes a traumatic operation with major complications being bladder and rectum perforation, pelvic abscess, anal canal injury and rectal leak \\[ 1 , 8 \\]. As evidenced by this report, a short-term ADT course may be used as a preoperative volume-reducing step aimed at decreasing the invasiveness of GMPC surgical removal. In cases when radical treatment is contraindicated or can be avoided due to the mild nature of GMPC-related symptoms, strong consideration should be given to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option capable of achieving complete GMPC resolution.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】In conclusion, we reported the first case of complete regression of a GMPC observed on consecutive MRI scans following 3 years of ADT with an LHRH agonist. The reported observation warrants further attention to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option for patients with GMPC in whom complete surgical resection is either contraindicated or can be deferred.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【26】No funding was received for this report.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【28】None declared.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】Ethical approval was not required.\n\n【31】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【32】Patient consent to publish the anonymized MR images was obtained in writing.\n\n【33】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【34】The guarantor of the study is Dr Tristan Barrett.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This can result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the location of the embolism. The risks and benefits of closure of small PFOs have not been well elucidated in prior studies. We describe a patient with a history of Factor V Leiden heterozygosity who presented with left arm pain secondary to arterial embolism. The patient was a 51-year-old male who initially presented to the emergency department after awaking from sleep with progressive, severe, burning left arm pain. He had also noted intermittent shortness of breath over the 2 weeks prior to admission. Temperature was 97.4 F, pulse 86, respiratory rate 20 and blood pressure 121/87. Oxygen saturation was 94% on supplemental oxygen. He had a cool left upper extremity and the patient described subjective paresthesias in this extremity. Left radial pulse was difficult to palpate. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.217 ng/l. White blood cell count was 11.8 and INR 1.1. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific T abnormalities in the anterior leads. His past medical history was notable for only hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke; there is currently no absolute indication for closure device. We describe the case of a 51-year-old male who had presented with left arm pain and shortness of breath. The computed tomography (CT) angiography of chest showed pulmonary emboli with heavy clot burden bilaterally. Heparin was started, but patient was found to have occlusion along large arteries of the left arm. Emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia were performed. The transthoracic echocardiogram done the next day with bubble study was positive for patent foramen ovale. Hypercoaguability showed factor V Leiden heterozygosity. Decision was made for the patient to initiate long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and closure was performed. Patient was advised that closure is off label but opted to proceed with closure in light of hypercoaguable state.\n\n【2】Chest X-ray did not show any process that could explain the acute hypoxic episode and patient sounded clear on lung exam. Hence, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest was performed with higher suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT angiography showed multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and left main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally (Fig. 1 ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done showing ejection fraction of 65% and severely elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 72 mmHg (Fig. 2 ). There was no free-floating cardiac thrombi detected, and echo did not show concomitant septal flattening; moreover, McConnell’s sign was not present Workup thus far was discussed with pulmonology and the patient was not felt to be a candidate for thrombectomy since he was not showing hemodynamic instability characteristic of massive PE, so therapeutic heparin drip was initiated and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for submassive PE.\n\n【3】Figure 1:\n\n【4】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【5】CT angiography of the chest was done showing multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the right and main pulmonary arteries into the segmental and subsegmental branches with heavy clot burden bilaterally.

It was initially thought that the pain was musculoskeletal in nature; however, after discovery of multiple coagulation events, prospect for embolism was endorsed. He was sent for ultrasound of upper and lower extremities. Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities revealed acute deep venous thrombosis within the left posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Venous ultrasound of the upper extremities showed no evidence of clot. Arterial ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the left proximal to mid-brachial artery with reconstitution of flow at the level of the distal brachial artery. Vascular surgery was consulted and the patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【10】Figure 3:\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Patient underwent emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia and sample of clot is shown.\n\n【13】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【14】A repeat TTE was done the next day and bubble study was positive for a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted regarding the need for open heart surgery versus percutaneous closure of the PFO. It was decided that the patient initiate long-term anticoagulation and that percutaneous closure could be performed at a later date. Hematology was consulted and the patient underwent a hypercoagulability workup which later was remarkable for Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. The patient opted for treatment with rivaroxaban over warfarin, and therefore rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily was started with plans to adjust dosing to 20 mg daily in three weeks. Another TTE was done on admission Day 3 showing improvement of pulmonary artery systolic pressure with RVSP of 46 mmHg. Pulmonology recommended against inferior vena cava filter placement as patient had rapid clinical improvement with systemic anticoagulation. After 2 more days of observation and treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital with plans for outpatient follow-up.\n\n【15】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n---------------------\n\n【16】One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study (Fig. 4 ). During outpatient cardiology follow-up, there was a discussion with the patient regarding the very large PFO/atrial septal defect (ASD) and his high risk of further embolic event. He was advised that closure is off-label and that the latest trials did not show superiority with closure versus anticoagulation. Given his high risk of embolic event, and because he was a scuba diver with increased risk for the decompression sickness, he opted to proceed with closure.\n\n【17】Figure 4:\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】One week after discharge, the patient underwent further evaluation with TEE showing a very large PFO with right to left shunt by bubble study.\n\n【20】Three weeks later, patient underwent percutaneous closure of the PFO with intraoperative fluoroscopy guidance. A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device (Fig. 5 ). This device consists of two disks, the first deployed on the left side of the PFO and then the second along the right side of the PFO. Placement was confirmed by TEE (Fig. 6 ). Patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and plavix for 3 months and advised to continue systemic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban.\n\n【21】Figure 5:\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】A balloon was placed across the PFO for size measurement and the decision made to deploy a 25 mm cribriform Amplatzer PFO occluder device.\n\n【24】Figure 6:\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】Placement was confirmed by TEE showing negative bubble study.\n\n【27】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【28】This patient was found to have a hypercoagulable state from Factor V Leiden heterozygosity. This predisposed him to the development of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and large bilateral PE \\[ 1 \\]. The development of arterial embolus to the left arm was made possible by a large PFO and has been cited several times in the literature \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【29】Paradoxical arterial embolism has been associated with PFO, atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), and ostium secundum ASD. Recommended therapy differs depending on the type of anomaly present and its characteristics that can predispose the patient to increased risk of arterial embolism events. PFO occurs in 25–30% of the general population. It is thought to be an innocent bystander in many patients with stroke; however, in the younger population (<55 years of age), it could be the underlying etiology for recurrent arterial embolus events, such as cryptogenic stroke or peripheral embolism \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【30】Currently, the usefulness of percutaneous closure of PFO versus surgical closure or medical therapy alone remains unclear. Further complicating factors to decide on treatment include hypercoaguable states that were not part of inclusion criteria when evaluating for efficacy. The current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke \\[ 4 \\]. Three studies (CLOSURE I trial, PC trial and RESPECT trial) have failed to demonstrate that percutaneous PFO closure relates significant reduction in primary endpoint (stroke, TIA, peripheral embolism, etc.) outcomes \\[ 5 – 7 \\]. However, extended data from the RESPECT trial after 10 years have shown some benefit to closure with 54% relative risk reduction for recurrent cryptogenic stroke versus those assigned to medical management of anticoagulation. Moreover, two more recent trials have shown some benefit to closure of PFO closure with aspirin in those with a true cryptogenic stroke: REDUCE and CLOSE \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Additional randomized trial data are still needed to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous PFO closure as compared to other treatment modalities before considering a widespread use.\n\n【31】LEARNING POINTS\n---------------\n\n【32】In summary, paradoxical arterial embolism via PFO should be determined to be a possibility in a patient presenting with deep venous thrombosis and/or PE who also have evidence of an arterial embolic event. Testing may include CT angiogram, venous/arterial ultrasound and echocardiography with bubble study. Treatment options include systemic anticoagulation, IVC filter placement, percutaneous closure of PFO, surgical closure of PFO or no closure of PFO depending on the patient’s presentation, history, and consideration of indications/contraindications. Pending further randomized trial data, percutaneous PFO closure may be considered as for prevention of paradoxical arterial embolism.\n\n【33】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【34】None declared.\n\n【35】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【36】Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Despite advances in treatment, it remains under detected and under treated. As an inherited condition, it poses a risk to the patient and family members. Most cases are due to defective low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) activity. Heterozygous mutations are common (1:250–1:300). Homozygous FH is very rare (2–3 in a million), with higher circulating cholesterol levels and a poorer cardiovascular prognosis. We present the management of a case of homozygous hypercholesterolemia due to homozygous LDLR mutation. The patient subsequently developed severe coronary artery and aortic valve disease despite aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. We review advanced lipid management options that include lipoprotein apheresis, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 inhibition, and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) accelerates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). Most commonly this is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, but rarely (~5% of cases) mutations in Apolipoprotein B-100 (APO-B), the ligand for LDLR, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9 _),_ Apolipoprotein E or LDLR adaptor protein genes are responsible. We present a rare case of extreme hypercholesterolaemia due to homozygous mutation in LDLR, complicated by multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic stenosis (AS).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old Indian man presented to endocrine services in 2012 with total cholesterol levels of 22 mmol/l \\[normal < 4.0 mmol/l\\]. He was asymptomatic. Corneal arcus and tendon xanthoma (dorsum of both hands, pre-tibial and Achilles tendons) were present ( Fig. 1 ). There was an ejection systolic murmur, normal peripheral pulses, and no organomegaly. Genotyping confirmed homozygous FH (HoFH) due to two LDLR gene mutations (the pathogenic p.Pro685Leu variant, identified in 25/2600 index FH cases, and once in homozygosity in large French database). The parents were first cousins. Interestingly, there was no family history of premature ACVD. His father died aged 82 and his mother aged 90. His three siblings have no known ACVD. Mandatory cascade testing showed high LDL levels in all six daughters with heterozygous FH (HeFH) status in all children _._ He has a history of hypertension managed on three agents. He worked as a teacher and does not drink alcohol or smoke. His lipid-lowering interventions are summarized in ( Fig. 2 ). Although LDL apheresis produced an ~ 83% reduction in LDL-C immediately after apheresis, LDL-C levels returned to baseline within days, and interval mean LDL-C remained high. Multiple interruptions to LDL-apheresis occurred due to arteriovenous fistula failure, which ultimately occluded after 18 months.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Pathognomonic signs of FH: tendon xanthoma deposits of cholesterol rich fat on the dorsum of both hands and knees.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Impact of sequential cholesterol lowering interventions on the patient’s lipid profile over time are shown, the ESC target LDL threshold (1.4 mmol/l) is shown in the broken line; to date lipoprotein apheresis achieved the greatest LDL-C reductions (−83% immediately post apheresis), but interval LDL-C were typically 11.8 mmol/l (−35%) equivalent to current therapy which can be managed in the home environment.\n\n【12】Cardiac computed tomography (CT) to screen for ACVD, confirmed multi-vessel CAD with extensive calcification of the ascending aorta, aortic valve, and posterior mitral annulus ( Fig. 3 ). Echocardiography confirmed severe AS (valve area: 0.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> ). Due to the hostile aortic root precluding coronary artery bypass grafting, transcutaneous aortic valve implantation and percutaneous coronary intervention were recommended.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】CT assessment of the heart and ascending aorta (left) shows extensive calcification (dense white, arrowheads) of the labeled structures; (right) shows calcification of the three leaflet aortic valve cusps (LCC, left coronary cusp; RCC, right coronary cusp; NCC, non-coronary cusp) causing severe AS.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Anichkov first demonstrated the role of high cholesterol in atherosclerosis in 1913 \\[ 1 \\]. Subsequently, the molecular basis of hypercholesterolemia has been determined \\[ 2 \\]. HeFH is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder (prevalence of 1:250–300), increasing premature ACVD risk ~20-fold \\[ 2 \\]. HoFH is very rare and life threatening. Characterized by > 4-fold increase in LDL-C from birth, the first major cardiovascular event is frequently in adolescence but occasionally early childhood \\[ 3 \\]. Early diagnosis and treatment improve clinical outcomes.\n\n【18】European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines emphasize a goal-targeted approach to reduce LDL-C for very high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk patients \\[ 4 \\]. Hyperlipidemia Education and Atherosclerosis Research Trust in the UK recommends an LDL-C target of 1.8 mmol/L and 2.5 mmol/L for HoFH patients with, and without, ACVD respectively. Patients may fail to reach desired targets despite aggressive treatment, here the aim to achieve the maximum reduction with minimum side effects \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Persistent hypercholesterolemia despite combination triple therapy (statin, ezetimibe and fenofibrate) triggers specialist lipid clinic referral.\n\n【19】Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, which typically achieves ~ 16% LDL-C reduction, was tried but discontinued due to gastrointestinal side effects. LDL-C remained high, fulfilling criteria for LDL-apheresis.\n\n【20】LDL-apheresis, although not widely available, is highly effective at LDL removal (by 50–70%) from plasma, reducing cardiovascular events by 80–90% \\[ 2 \\]. However, target interval LDL-C levels may not be achieved despite immediate post-treatment reduction. For example, our patient’s interval LDL-C values were 11.8 mmol/l with LDL apheresis every 2 weeks.\n\n【21】PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies inhibiting degradation of LDLR, thus increasing cholesterol clearance by hepatocytes \\[ 2 \\]. Two Food and Drug Administration-approved PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolucumab, are given as injections every 2–4 weeks \\[ 2 \\]. Evolocumab reduces LDL-C in HoFH patients with or without lipoprotein apheresis (Trial Assessing Long Term USe of PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Genetic LDL Disorders study) accompanied by a reduction in cardiovascular events \\[ 5 \\]. However, the addition of PCSK9 inhibition \\[420 mg injections fortnightly\\] was ineffective in our patient (~1% LDL reduction). This may be related to the complex spectrum of consequences of the Pro685Leu mutation, which in functional assays include defective processing, accelerated turnover, reduced cell surface expression and impaired LDLR activity \\[ 6–9 \\]. Therefore, lomitapide \\[5 mg ON\\] was added to the medication regime.\n\n【22】Lomitapide is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor that reduces plasma levels of all APO-B-containing lipoproteins. In our patient, this achieved a 54% reduction in LDL-C after 6 months of treatment (the most recent LDL-C is 8.33 mmol/l). Further dose escalation is planned. Phase II and III, single-arm studies in HoFH show dose-dependent LDL-C reductions between 25 and 51% \\[ 10 \\]. An observational study showed a 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction \\[ 2 \\]. The monitoring of transaminases is necessary during lomitapide treatment due to increased hepatic fat \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【23】Aside from the complexities of this patient’s lipid management, it is notable that significant cardiovascular complications have arisen in the absence of symptoms. CVD risk assessment tools developed for the general population do not apply to FH patients as the atherosclerotic burden from long-term exposure to high LDL levels is underestimated \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【24】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【25】HoFH is a very rare severe genetic disorder with cholesterol levels > 4-fold normal from birth. Given the increased ACVD risk patients require a multi-agency approach to their care and regular screening for cardiovascular complications.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】**_Conflict of interest statement_** .

Laboratory tests revealed a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with plasma glucose at 44 mmol/L, calculated plasma osmolarity of 332 mOsm/L, and absence of ketoacidosis. Her serum glycated hemoglobin was 16%. Three days following the initiation of hypoglycemic treatment with insulin, she observed uncontrollable movements of her arms. Neurological examination revealed involuntary, bilateral, choreic movements affecting her upper extremities (Supplementary Video 1). The movements worsened with activity; however, they did not occur during sleep. Her mental status, verbal response, and other physical parameters were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense T1 signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally ( Fig. 1A ). These findings were consistent with hyperglycemic chorea. Choreic movements persisted even after hyperglycemia correction and treatment with haloperidol. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) revealed marked reduction of striatal accumulation bilaterally ( Fig. 1B ), suggesting presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction involvement in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemic chorea. Accordingly, dopamine replacement was considered as a therapeutic option.

The cyst measured 54.7 × 33.4 × 55.0 mm ( Fig. 1 ). Normal kidneys and bladder were identified and were separate from the cyst. The amniotic fluid volume was normal. A female infant weighing 3085 g was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks’ gestation. Apgar scores at 1- and 5-min were 8 and 9, respectively. She had poor oxygenation owing to diaphragmatic compression by a giant hepatic cyst and required respiratory assistance with continuous positive airway pressure. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a clear unilocular cyst measuring 98 × 60 × 32 mm and occupying the right side of the abdomen, extending from the inferior aspect of the right liver lobe to the pelvis ( Fig. 2 ). The infant’s respiratory condition gradually improved, but the hepatic cyst did not regress spontaneously. We decided that neonatal treatment was desirable because of the symptoms such as apneic attack related to pressure on related structures caused by the cyst, and performed ultrasound-guided percutaneous hepatic cyst puncture drainage when the infant was 15 days old. The fluid inside the liver cyst was clear and contained no bile components. There was no continuity with the bile duct. The liver cyst decreased in size, but rapidly re-grew. The infant’s respiratory status was unstable, and she fed poorly, owing to compression by the hepatic cyst; therefore, we performed fenestration of the hepatic cyst when she was 43 days old. We performed laparotomy via an umbilical arc incision and punctured and aspirated the hepatic cyst contents ( Fig. 3A ). The cyst was abducted from the umbilical region, and the cyst wall was excised with an ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device ( Fig. 3B ). Laparoscopy confirmed that there was no liver injury or biliary fistula ( Fig. 3C and **D** ). She received a single-dose of cefazolin intravenously as a prophylactic antibiotic before surgery. Histopathologically, hepatocytes and connective tissue were found in the outer layer of the cyst, and dilated capillaries and lymphatic vessels were scattered throughout. Immunohistologically, the cells supporting the cyst showed the CKAE1/AE3, D2-40, calretinin, WT-1 were positive and CD34 and hepatocyte-1 were negative ( Fig. 4 ). The diagnosis was mesothelial cell-derived hepatic cyst. After the surgery, there were no complications and no respiratory assistance was required. Breastfeeding was resumed on the first postoperative day. One year after the operation, CT showed regeneration of liver tissue ( Fig. 5 ). We regularly follow her with ultrasonography and she has not had a recurrence for 3 years after her surgery. We show the umbilical wound 3 years after the surgery ( Fig. 6 ).\n\n【18】Figure 5\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】CT image at 1 month after fenestration.\n\n【21】Figure 6\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】Umbilical incision 3 years after surgery (arrow).\n\n【24】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【25】Congenital hepatic cysts in fetuses or newborns are relatively uncommon; however, routine ultrasound is detecting an increasing number of them prenatally \\[ 4 \\]. Hepatic cysts are usually subdivided into parasitic and nonparasitic cysts. Parasitic cysts do not occur in fetuses. Nonparasitic hepatic cysts can also be classified as solitary or multiple. Multiple hepatic cysts may also occur in cases of congenital kidney and liver polycystic disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis. Solitary nonparasitic hepatic cysts are very rare, do not appear to communicate with the biliary system and are not associated with cystic lesions in other organs \\[ 5 \\]. A solitary hepatic cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a fetal or neonatal abdomen with a unilocular cyst. Laparoscopic excision of congenital hepatic cysts is a beneficial procedure in pediatric patients \\[ 3 \\]. Laparoscopic-assisted hepatic cyst fenestration by umbilical incision can be performed safely and it is a cosmetically superior procedure. This procedure can be one of the options for the treatment of neonatal congenital hepatic cysts.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】We would like to thank Dr Ayumi Oshima, Dr Kazuyuki Baba and Dr Hisanori Sobajima for their assistance with the patient’s medical treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Early detection of such lesions can prevent complications by linking patients to care early. We report a case of a 45-year-old Chinese men who has sex with men (MSM) presenting with a wound on his penis after masturbation. Initial impressions of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation led to a circumcision and frenulectomy. Routine histology done provided an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates suggestive of Syphilis. Serology was done to confirm the diagnosis and patient was treated with oral doxycycline for 2 weeks. This case aims to highlight the importance of routine histology during circumcisions especially because lesions such as syphilitic chancres are not always typical in presentation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Syphilis is an infection caused by the _Treponema pallidum_ spirochete and has a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. A syphilitic infection is classically thought to evolve through 4 basic stages—Primary, Secondary, Latent and Tertiary with additional qualifiers of Early and Late depending on the duration of the infection \\[ 1 \\]. While this system provides a framework for understanding the natural history of a syphilitic infection, the key challenge in diagnosing based on such a system is that clinical signs can be subtle and are often mistaken as other less sinister ailments. The traditional teaching of a painless ulcer with a clean base for example tends to be an exception than the rule with many primary syphilitic lesions having many different and atypical presentations \\[ 2 \\]. This is the main reason that it is known as the ‘Great Mimicker’ and has gone undetected despite advances in screening methods \\[ 3 \\]. Furthermore, because many of the signs in a Primary and Secondary Syphilis resolve spontaneously, patients seldom attend follow-up clinic sessions \\[ 4 \\]. Underpinning the importance of early detection of Syphilis is that left untreated, Syphilis progresses into 3 major life-threatening syndromes—Late Neurosyphilis. Cardiovascular Syphilis and Late Benign gummas \\[ 5 \\]. Certain populations such as the MSM are known to have a higher prevalence of Syphilis compared with the heterosexual population \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【4】Circumcision is the process of partially or completely removing the foreskin and is one of the most common surgical procedures for men \\[ 7 \\]. Indications for circumcision include religious/cultural purposes, phimosis, balanoposthitis and risk reduction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission \\[ 8 \\]. There is much debate about the utility of routine histology of the excised prepuce in circumcisions for medical indications and the extent to which such an investigation changes the overall management.\n\n【5】We report the clinical findings of a patient presenting with wound at the frenulum of the penis noticed immediately after masturbation, which was more in keeping with a traumatic wound, based on the patients’ history, that was eventually confirmed to be a Primary Syphilis infection.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 45-year-old Chinese man presented to the clinic with a wound at the ventral surface of the penis. Patient reported that he noticed the wound after he masturbated a few days ago. He reported that he felt a sudden pain as he was masturbating and noticed a wound around the frenulum. Patient also complained of pain around the wound especially during erections.\n\n【8】Patient has an allergy to Penicillin but no previous medical history or family history of autoimmune diseases. No history of tobacco smoking or alcohol use. Patient is a Men who has Sex with Men (MSM) and engages in predominantly penetrative anal sex. Patient reports that sexual intercourse is usually protected and has 3–5 sexual partners that year. Partners are usually casual, and patient does not know the HIV or Syphilis status of any of his partners. His last Syphilis and HIV test was done 6 months ago and was non-Reactive. Last sexual intercourse was 3 months ago.\n\n【9】Physical examination found a partial thickness tear at the ventral aspect of the penis, midline and extending 5 mm along the longitudinal aspect of the frenulum. Wound was shallow with regular borders. Base of the lesion was yellow with minimal discharge and no surrounding erythema. No inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other lesions were seen in the groin.\n\n【10】Figure 1\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】(A) Initial presentation of ulcer; (B) histology of resected foreskin demonstrating presence of plasma cells.\n\n【13】Initial impression was that of a frenulum tear secondary to overzealous masturbation. Patient was offered a frenulectomy to remove the remaining frenulum. Patient opted for a circumcision at the same time as he already had an elective circumcision planned for a few months’ time.\n\n【14】Circumcision was done on the same day of the visit under local anaesthesia. A dorsal slit method was used to remove the foreskin; the remnant frenulum tissue was removed in the same incision. The circumferential wound was closed with 3–0 Vicryl, while the wound at the frenulum was left to heal by secondary intention. Excised tissue including the foreskin and the remnant tissue surrounding the frenulum was sent for histology.\n\n【15】Histology found that the tissue from the remnant tissue of the frenulum to be extensively ulcerated. The ulcer contained a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells with polymorphs towards the surface and a dense underlying mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate including a large number of plasma cells strongly suggestive of a Syphilitic infection.\n\n【16】Syphilis tests were done according to current laboratory protocols. Syphilis serology yielded a Positive Treponemal Test (Syphilis Treponemal Antibody) and Positive for both Non-Treponemal Tests—Rapid Plasmin Reagin (RPR) Titre 1:2 and _T. Pallidum_ Particle Agglutination (TPPA).\n\n【17】Given the previous negative Syphilis blood test 6 months ago, a new positive Treponemal and Non-Treponemal blood test result and a wound with plasma cell infiltrates seen on histology, the diagnosis of primary syphilis was made.\n\n【18】Patient was commenced on 2 weeks of doxycycline due to his allergy to penicillin. The patient’s wound healing was uneventful with no secondary infections and completely healed at the end of 2 weeks. A repeat blood test was done 1 month after which demonstrated a decrease in the titre levels of the RPR tests. Follow-up bloods after 6 months demonstrated a Non-Reactive RPR with the Treponemal Antibody and TPPA remaining reactive. The diagnosis was that of Primary Syphilis status post-completed treatment with serological scarring.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】We present a case of a man who presented with a wound along the frenulum that occurred after masturbation. Originally thought to be a mechanical frenulum tear from overzealous masturbation, patient elected for a circumcision with a frenulectomy. Routine histology revealed an unexpected finding of plasma cell infiltrates. The patient’s sexual orientation of an MSM, placed him at a higher risk of contracting Syphilis, prompting further testing in the form of Syphilis serology that eventually led to the conclusion that the initial frenulum tear was in fact a primary syphilitic chancre. We hope that this case would highlight the importance of routine histology in circumcision in guiding the diagnostic process.\n\n【21】Currently, there is an ongoing debate on the utility of routine histology for circumcision. Previous studies have compared using clinical signs or histology to diagnose dermatological lesions on the foreskin in patients undergoing circumcision but have yet to come to a consensus on which modality is superior \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【22】Most recently, Kerr _et al._ \\[ 11 \\] report that clinical diagnosis of lesions in the prepuce correspond to histological diagnosis in up to 80% of cases. Coupled with the lack of evidence associating dermatological lesions of the foreskin with the development of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, these authors are of the opinion that routine histology testing is not required and that clinicians can reliably achieve a diagnosis solely with a physical examination of the area. Additional findings in the study also suggest significant costs saving with the same patient outcome when foregoing a histological investigation.\n\n【23】In a response to these claims, Bunker _et al._ raises an important perspective that a diagnosis need not purely be a clinical or histological diagnosis but a combination of the two. The authors highlighted important shortcomings of the initial study by Kerr _et al._ such as the lack of a uniform control group when making the comparisons between the accuracy of a clinical and histological diagnosis \\[ 12 \\]. Indeed, it is further reported by Bunker _et al._ that their centre’s experience up to 45% of the diagnosis of Penile intraepithelial neoplasia was achieved only with a histology with only 8% of the clinicians being confident of the diagnosis without histological confirmation.\n\n【24】From the standpoint of using histology as part of the diagnostic work up instead of solely relying on clinical examination, we agree with that routine histology should be done for circumcision. Syphilis is a prime example of the need for clinical assessment and laboratory investigations to complement each other to provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【25】Syphilis is a disease caused by the _T. Pallidum_ bacteria and is known as the Great Mimicker as early symptoms can be vague and misdiagnosis based on clinical signs is very common. Primary syphilis is the earliest phase of the infection and is defined by the presence of a painless chancre which usually resolves spontaneously. The situation is similar in secondary Syphilis where a prominent but painless rash erupts and disappears without any intervention. The transient and seemingly indolent nature of the physical manifestations of the initial stages of a Syphilis infection mean that the diagnosis cannot be achieved solely on a physical examination but also requires laboratory investigations. Wound swabs for general bacterial cultures are unable to detect syphilis because the treponemal bacterium does not grow well in regular culture mediums. Although is possible to detect the presence of _T. Pallium_ in wounds with dark field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing or polymerase chain reaction, these investigations tend to be labour intensive and not commonly done \\[ 13 \\]. Histology of tissue can identify plasma cell infiltrates which is a result of the inflammatory response elicited by the infection and is common in a Primary Syphilitic infection \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【26】In the current case, the lesion that the patient presented with was painful and its appearance coincided with a traumatic event (masturbation). The differential diagnoses considered when approaching this case included, trauma, herpes and Syphilis. Although Syphilis was one of the differentials in this case, the lesion reportedly manifested shortly after a traumatic incident of overzealous masturbation and the presence of pain (Syphilitic chancres classically described as being painless) directed us towards considering the wound more traumatic in nature. While there is evidence to suggest that certain at-risk populations such as the MSM group have a higher prevalence of Syphilis, this patient’s sexual orientation was of secondary consideration, and we would like to highlight the process of achieving the diagnosis which was made possible because of routine histology \\[ 8 \\]. Without the additional information about the presence of plasma cell infiltrates in the excised tissue provided by routine histology, the diagnosis of Syphilis would have otherwise gone untreated. The early diagnosis and prompt treatment of primary Syphilis in this patient allowed for an early intervention in reducing his risk of developing a more severe form of the disease. This would not have been possible without a combined diagnostic approach of using both clinical examination and laboratory investigation.\n\n【27】Presentations of Syphilis are seldom straightforward; however, the consequences of a missed diagnosis and delay in treatment can allow the disease to progress to Tertiary Syphilis which can be life threatening. We hope that in reviewing this case, we can call to mind the fact that Syphilis chancres are never typical in presentation and the importance of routinely incorporating investigations such as histology in circumcisions to complement clinical assessment.\n\n【28】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------\n\n【29】All authors contributed equally to the writing and preparation of the manuscript.\n\n【30】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【31】The Authors have no competing interests.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】No funding was obtained for this Case Report.\n\n【34】ETHICAL DECLARATION\n-------------------\n\n【35】Ethics approval and consent has been approved by our center’s (Dr Tan Medical Center—Singapore) internal review board.\n\n【36】Consent for publication has been obtained by the patient discussed in this Care Report.\n\n【37】Availability of data and materials—no data set used in this Case Report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In addition, the dissection flap was found to inhibit aortic valve function, resulting in moderate aortic regurgitation (AR)—which mirrors an evident explanation for respiratory failure after initiation of vaECMO via flow-associated pulmonary fluid overload on the basis of an increased left ventricular afterload ( Fig. 1C and **D** ; Supplementary Videos 3 and 4 ).\n\n【3】Figure 1\n\n【4】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【5】TEE identified a dissection flap which caused the occlusion of the LM coronary artery, resulting in the picture of STEMI ( **A** and **B** ).

Mild forms of non-inflammatory EBA are characterized by skin lesions and have gained great relevance in the literature. However, resistant inflammatory EBA with widespread mucosal involvement remains a rare entity given its low prevalence. It commonly represents a great burden for the patient’s quality of life with most cases being resistant to different therapeutic modalities. We present a case of resistant inflammatory EBA with esophageal strictures that improved after therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a well-defined acquired autoimmune disease that results from autoantibodies against anchoring fibrils within the basement membrane of collagen type VII \\[ 1 \\]. It can be divided into two subtypes: non-inflammatory and inflammatory. Non-inflammatory is the most common subtype, limited to skin lesions in body prone areas. In contrast, the inflammatory subtype has a widespread involvement and affects the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, larynx and esophagus. However, gastrointestinal tract involvement is rare, and its incidence is too low to be determined. We present an uncommon case presentation of EBA with esophageal strictures that improved with dilation, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and rituximab (RTX) \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 71-year-old female with EBA and history of Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the right orbit in remission presented with non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting; associated dysphagia, odynophagia and unintentional weight loss of 8 lbs in the last 1 month. Physical exam was significant for scattered skin bullae throughout the body. There were oral ulcerations without visible thrush. The patient was started on lidocaine and Maalox cocktail, sucralfate and proton pump inhibitor with partial relief of symptoms. Barium swallow esophagram evidenced multiple stenotic areas ( Fig. 1 ). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed revealing extensive palate and laryngeal ulcers ( Fig. 2 ), along with erosive lesions and esophageal stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus ( Fig. 3 ). The lower esophagus and stomach were spared. The stenotic areas were successfully dilated with Savary dilators. Biopsy revealed ulcerative esophagitis with acute and chronic areas of inflammation that resulted negative for metaplasia, viral and fungal infections ( Fig. 4a and b ). The patient was initiated on IVIg and continued RTX with symptoms improvement.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Barium swallow esophagram with multiple areas of stenosis in the upper and lower third of the esophagus.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Multiple shallow ulcers in the oropharynx.\n\n【12】**Figure 3**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Area of stenosis in the upper third of the esophagus with sloughing of the surrounded mucosa.\n\n【15】**Figure 4**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】( **a** ) Biopsy from the lower third of the esophagus.

Fibrin is seen in the space between the epithelium and stroma consistent with non-infectious inflammation and area of stenosis.\n\n【18】Regarding the patient’s EBA, she had a long-standing history of progressive, widespread blisters, along with palate and laryngeal ulcers for the past 3 years, which previously failed steroids and dapsone treatment. Two months before presentation, the patient was started on RTX given the severe, non-remitting course of her EBA. The patient remained in complete remission with no further mucosal involvement for 5 months after the initial presentation and completing 5 cycles of IVIg, and RTX. On follow-up skin biopsy, dermatopathology analysis by immunofluorescence showed no deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA or C3 in the epidermis, dermis, basement membrane zone and vessels of the oral mucosa. The patient was discharged with dermatology and gastroenterology (GI) follow-up. No further GI symptoms were reported after 9 months of follow-up visits.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】EBA has a worldwide annual prevalence of 0.2% per 1 million people. It has been previously associated with Crohn’s disease (in 25–30% of reported cases), ulcerative colitis, along with other autoimmune disorders such as B cell lymphoma, amyloidosis, thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diabetes; out of which, the first three have only been proven by research trials. Histopathological analysis has shown evidence of circulating tissue antibodies against type VII collagen in B cell lymphoma patients \\[ 2 , 4 \\].\n\n【21】The treatment for EBA depends on the extent of the blistering lesions and their effect on the patient’s quality of life. First-line therapy for mild (local) disease is local vs systemic steroids; or steroid-sparing agents such as colchicine, dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. The classic feature of inflammatory EBA is the mucosal extension of the blistering lesions, which has been reported in 20% of cases and can be life-threatening. This subtype tends to be refractory to steroids and steroid-sparing agents. Nevertheless, IVIg along with other therapies such as humanized anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies (RTX) have shown positive outcomes \\[ 5-7 \\].\n\n【22】Gastrointestinal involvement of EBA is uncommon. The clinical presentation consists of multiple blisters and ulcer formation in the oral mucosa and palate region with progressive dysphagia, and/or odynophagia. There has been an established relationship between esophageal webs and EBA, reported in 6% of cases. The esophageal blistering/scarring process leads to the formation of fibrotic mucosa and esophageal stenosis. Management often encompasses dietary modification, sequential esophageal dilations with a balloon catheter or a bougie, and a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support. In one study with 53 patients, a total of 182 dilations were performed over a median follow-up period of 3.5 years. In total, 95% of the patients improved in the dysphagia score and weight. Possible risks are esophageal rupture and re-stenosis. Overall, endoscopic dilation is a safe procedure that provides symptom relief and improvement of the quality of life \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【23】One meta-analysis designed to study the efficacy of various treatments on remission showed that all EBA cases had a satisfactory response to IVIG and RTX independent of the disease severity. In a subgroup analysis, EBA with mucosal involvement was associated with complete remission. Furthermore, RTX and IVIG exhibited the best profile outcome for complete remission in severe EBA. However, it is not clear which mechanism RTX and IVIg use to execute their effect over susceptible autoantigenic B cell lymphocytes. IVIg is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its ability to eliminate clinical autoimmunity and restore physiologic homeostasis. \\[ 9 \\]. These two agents might have a synergistic effect, but additional trials with larger samples are required. The length of therapy with IVIg and RTX is still controversial but expert consensus suggests that multiple cycles are necessary with a minimum length of 1 month \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【24】The goal of treatment is to control the disease and to avoid new lesion formation. The EBA inflammatory subtype prognosis is poor and 1-year remission off medication has not been widely proven in previous trials. Complete remission is uncommon without at least short courses of medical therapy. Hence, moderate to long-term intensity therapies are needed in most cases to achieve lesser disease activity and remission. Severe forms of EBA have an unfavorable remission profile with frequent exacerbations and rapid scarring, negatively affecting the patient’s quality of life \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【25】Our patient had a typical course of inflammatory EBA with GI mucosal involvement. Her condition was refractory to conventional therapy, but later achieved remission for more than 5 months after combination therapy with RTX and IV immunoglobulin.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【27】Dr Hilary Hertan.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Informed consent provided was obtained from the patient.

Ninety percent of CDHs are reported to involve the posterolateral aspects of the diaphragm as described by Bochdalek in 1848. Bochdalek hernias (BHs) are very rare beyond childhood with an incidence of 0.17% and are often incidentally discovered \\[ 1 \\]. Symptomatic hernias are misdiagnosed in up to 38% of cases leading to unnecessary interventions such as chest tube insertion or failure to diagnose which could lead to strangulation of the herniated content and death \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A woman in her 50s presented to our Emergency Department with a 5-day history of dull abdominal pain and vomiting which later started to be associated with streaks of blood. Two days before presentation she developed breathlessness which was aggravated by food intake and associated with intermittent episodes of dry cough and wheezes. She had no chronic conditions, had no surgery or trauma and was not taking any long-term medication. On examination, she was dyspneic and unable to lie flat. Her oxygen saturation was 94% on 4 L/min of oxygen. She had a respiratory rate of 30/min, a heart rate of 107/min and a blood pressure of 177/100 mmHg. She was afebrile. Chest physical examination revealed a hyper-resonant percussion note on the left side with decreased air entry and bilateral wheezes. Her abdomen was distended with a tympanic percussion note.\n\n【6】INVESTIGATIONS\n--------------\n\n【7】Her lab investigations showed total white blood cells count of 10.2109/L, heamoglobin 12.1 g/dl; renal and liver functions were within normal range. Her electrolytes were potassium 2.5 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L and her Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Her initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left-sided air-fluid level with a circumferential opacity and mediastinal shift to the right side; there was an initial impression of tension pneumothorax ( Fig. 1 ). But given the patient’s hemodynamic stability and radiologist advice, a computed tomography (CT) thoracic scan followed that showed a large left diaphragmatic hernia with the stomach and the spleen inside the left chest cavity causing significant mass effect with the result of total lung collapse ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】CXR showing left-sided air fluid level.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】CT Thorax showing herniation of the stomach and spleen in the left chest cavity.\n\n【14】DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n----------------------\n\n【15】The patient initially exhibited acute gastrointestinal symptoms pointing to an acute abdomen because of abdominal pain, vomiting and distension. The presentation to the hospital was associated with respiratory distress symptoms and signs on examination which could have led to a clinical misdiagnosis of tension pneumothorax at the early stages, but the patient’s hemodynamic stability allowed performing the CXR. The follow-up CT scan advised by the radiologist confirmed the diagnosis of an obstructed diaphragmatic hernia which would explain both the respiratory and gastrointestinal presentation.\n\n【16】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【17】Following the CT scan and confirmation of diagnosis, a nasogastric tube was inserted. This drained 1.5 L of fluid over 2 h with a large quantity of air. A considerable improvement in the patient’s respiratory distress was noted with the respiratory rate normalizing and a follow-up CXR showed a dramatic reduction in the size of the intrathoracic stomach with a matching lung re-expansion ( Fig. 3 ). She was brought to the operating room the following morning after appropriate resuscitation and electrolyte correction. The chest was entered via a seventh intercostal space leftposterolateral thoracotomy revealing a 5-cm defect in the left dome of the diaphragm with an incomplete hernia sac with the stomach, greater omentum and spleen incarcerated inside the chest cavity ( Fig. 4 ). Adhesions were released and the stomach, omentum and spleen were reduced into the abdominal cavity. The defect was primarily closed in two layers (double breasting). The patient was sent home on the fifth post-op day following an uneventful recovery. She was seen 6 weeks later and was doing well.\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】CXR Post nasogastric tube suction with marked left lung re-expansion.\n\n【21】Figure 4\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】Left posterolateral thoracotomy revealing herniated spleen, stomach and greater omentum.\n\n【24】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【25】In their systematic review, Brown _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] showed that 78% of symptomatic BHs occur on the left side similar to our case. A precipitating factor such as pregnancy, chronic constipation and rigorous physical activity can be found in 25% of symptomatic patients, none were found in our case \\[ 2 \\]. Half of the patients present acutely with symptoms such as pain, pressure sensation in the abdomen or the chest, and symptoms of obstruction or pulmonary symptoms \\[ 2 \\]. As these symptoms are ubiquitous, additional clinical clues would include postprandial respiratory symptoms, abdominal or thoracic symptoms aggravated by the supine position and abdominal symptoms aggravated by physical effort \\[ 3 \\]. The results of the physical exam in our case gave rise to a diagnosis of pneumothorax. This highlights the importance of a careful analysis of the patient’s symptoms. The most common radiological modality used to diagnose CDH is the CXR followed by the CT scan, which is the most accurate modality \\[ 4 \\]. Nasogastric tube decompression is a common initial management step in obstructed Hiatal hernias \\[ 5 \\]. Using the same approach here improved the patient’s symptoms and allowed the surgical procedure to be performed in more of a semi-elective setting. It is proposed, though rarely, that rupture of the hernial sac may be the initiator of the progression towards a symptomatic hernia. That could have been the case with our patient as a herniated incomplete sac was found. It is recommended to repair any diaphragmatic hernias discovered, irrespective of the symptoms. We used primary repair in our case. Brown _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] found that primary repair was the most performed with no reported recurrence.\n\n【26】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【27】Obstructed Bochdalek hernias rarely exhibits symptoms in adults and should be suspected whenever gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms intertwine to avoid potentially disastrous consequences.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Informed consent has been obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed on the left brachial vein. A post-insertion chest X-ray showed an abnormal left mediastinum catheter trajectory ( Fig. 1A ). To rule out arterial placement, the following steps were taken: First, the catheter was transduced, exhibiting a mean arterial pressure of 0 mmHg and no arterial waveforms. Second, blood gasses were performed on a PICC line blood sample (pH = 7.4, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 47.1, PaO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 35, HCO <sub>3 </sub> \\= 29, saturation = 64%), which resembled venous rather than arterial blood. Third, a left arm ultrasound showed the PICC line in the brachial vein and a small left axillary vein nonocclusive thrombus. Fourth, the interventional radiology attending was consulted, and concurred with the diagnosis of a left-sided superior vena cava (SVC). Due to the associated risks, the left PICC was removed, and a contralateral PICC was placed ( Fig. 1B ). After confirming that the tip of the catheter was located in the mid right atrium ( Fig. 1B ), the line was pulled 2 cm. A contrast computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a duplicate left superior vena cava ( Fig. 1C and D ).\n\n【1】Figure 1\n\n【2】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【3】( **A** ) Chest X-ray shows a PICC located the left mediastinum.

Most common cause of esotropia in high myopic elderly is Heavy Eye Syndrome. An uncommon cause in young adults is Acute Acquired Comitant Esotropia often associated with excessive indulgence in near work. A 21 year old male patient presented with diplopia for one year, more for distance than near and spent more than 8-10 hours for near tasks. Unaided visual acuity in BE was 2/60 and was 6/9 in RE and 6/6 in LE with correction. Prism base cover test revealed 25 BO PD for distance and 20 BO PD for near.

It is important to understand the pathogenesis of this entity and consider other possible causes of esotropia in myopia. Key words: Myopia, Esotropia, Comitant, Diplopia.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Esotropia in myopia is a rare entity with varied presentation in different age groups. The examination and management of such patients can be very challenging \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【4】The most common etiology of progressive esotropia in high myopia in an elderly is the ‘Heavy Eye Syndrome’, which presents with diplopia secondary to progressive esotropia and hypotropia with limitation of abduction and elevation \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【5】Another uncommon form of esotropia in young adults is Acute Acquired Comitant Esotropia (ACCE) \\[ 2 \\]. Prolonged adduction of the medial rectus muscle due to near-target convergence may cause shortening of the medial rectus muscle and reduced ability to maintain orthotropia at a distance as proposed by Guyton \\[ 3 \\]. This paper reports a similar case of a young adult with high myopia with diplopia.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 21-year-old myopic patient presented with diplopia for 1 year. It was more for distance than during near work. He did ~8–10 hours of near work without using glasses as it reduced his diplopia.\n\n【8】The patient had no history of head trauma, use of systemic medication or systemic illnesses. Ophthalmic examination revealed unaided visual acuity (VA) of 2/60 in both eyes and used −5.75 DS in the right eye (RE), giving VA of 6/36 and −5.75DS/−0.50 DC @180 in the left eye (LE), giving VA of 6/24. Cyclo-refraction revealed wet retinoscopic values of −8.00 DS/−1.50 DC @180 and −7.75 DS/−2.00 DC @180 in RE and LE, respectively.\n\n【9】On orthoptics examination, the Hirschberg test revealed 2 mm (30 diopters) eso-deviation in RE. ( Fig. 1 ). Extra ocular movement was full. The worth four dot test revealed diplopia for distance and near, with maximum separation of images in levoversion. The Prism Base Cover Test with correction revealed 25 Base Out (BO) Prism Diopter (PD) for distance and 20 BO PD for near ( Fig. 2 ); and without correction, it was 16 BO PD and 8 BO PD for distance and near, respectively. Accommodative convergence to accommodation ratio was 4:1 and was done by the gradient method \\[ 4 \\]. The axial length measurement of RE was 26.91 mm and 26.99 mm of LE. His corneal topography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbit were normal.\n\n【10】Figure 1\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】RE esotropia without glasses.\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】RE esotropia increased with glasses.\n\n【16】He was prescribed glasses after a post-mydriatic test. A prism trial of 6 BO PD in RE and 6 BO PD in LE was started, which removed diplopia for near and decreased for distance.\n\n【17】Definite management was done after 3 months with RE 8 mm lateral rectus (LR) resection. During surgery, thinning of LR muscle was seen, and its histo-pathological examination revealed features of chronic myopathy with primarily collagenous tissue with a single area of scattered muscle fibers and marked endomysial fibrosis, suggestive of LR Muscle atrophy ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Histopathology section using special stain of LR muscle section.\n\n【21】After 1 month, the patient was orthotropic with BCVA 6/6 in both eyes with glasses and no diplopia ( Fig. 4 ).\n\n【22】Figure 4\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】RE orthotropic 1 week after surgery.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】AACE is a special subtype of esotropia that is characterized by the acute onset of comitant esotropia with diplopia and is more common in older children and adults. Ocular motility is generally normal without the evidence of paralysis of the extraocular muscle \\[ 5 \\]. AACE is classified into three clinical types by Lee _et al_ . \\[ 6 \\]: (i) Swan-type esotropia that occurs in eyes with fusion disruption, (ii) Burian-Franceschetti type of esotropia characterized by minimal hypermetropia and diplopia, often associated with physical and psychological stress and (iii) Beilschowsky-type esotropia that occurs in adolescents and adults with varying degree of myopia. The mechanism of Beilchowsky-type AACE is thought to be uncorrected myopia with excessive near work, resulting in the inability to maintain the balance between the converging and diverging forces of the eye, and the subsequent development of increased tonus of the medial rectus muscle, leading to esotropia \\[ 6 \\]. In a study of acquired distance esotropia associated with myopia in young adults by Zheng K _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\], 11 adult myopic patients with distance esotropia were studied, who were engaged in near work for an average of 12 hours per day. Among them, seven underwent a pathological examination of their LR muscles, which showed no muscle fibers but rather collagenous fibers \\[ 5 \\]. In another study by Zhu M _et al._ , it was found that ACCE was more common in young adults who performed excessive close visual activities and used digital devices late night \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】Since most of our daily activities are performed over smart phones, smartphone use is the majority of ‘near work’. Decreasing near work activities can help decrease the progression of esotropia in myopia in young adults.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】I extend my sincere thanks to the patient for trusting me with his treatment.

We present a middle-aged man who lost consciousness during an air flight for 30 minutes, without any respiratory symptoms.

They are caused by smoking and deficiency of α-1 antitrypsin but may occur due to illicit drug use and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Apart from the mentioned risk factors above, they may be more frequent in those greater than 45 years of age \\[ 1 \\]. We describe a 42-year-old healthy male who developed sudden loss of consciousness during an air flight, with an incidental finding of a giant lung bulla.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 42-year-old army man presented with a sudden loss of consciousness for 30 minutes during an air flight that had ascended to 4000 meters above sea level. The loss of consciousness was associated with left arm and left truncal twitching with no eye-rolling, tongue-biting, or bowel and bladder incontinence. Before the loss of consciousness, he experienced frontal headache and dizziness. He did not report any chest pain or difficulty in breathing. He denied a history of smoking, illicit drug use, or trauma. He had traveled by air several times before, most recently being 2 months before the current complaint; however, he never experienced any complications.\n\n【7】On admission, he was fully conscious with stable vitals. His neurology examination revealed facial asymmetry with reduced power of the left upper limb though the tone and reflexes were intact. There were reduced breath sounds on the upper and middle zones of the left lung. His laboratory blood workup was not significant and the serology for HIV and α-1 antitrypsin were negative. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal. His chest x-ray revealed a giant left lung bulla ( Figure 1 ). Chest CT revealed a single giant bulla in the left upper lobe, occupying nearly a third of the left hemithorax suggesting a giant apical bullous emphysema ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Supine chest x-ray shows a large thin-walled cavity in the left upper lobe occupying more than one-third of the affected hemithorax.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Axial (A), Coronal (B), and Sagittal (C) chest CT lung window shows a thin-walled cavitary lesion with thin septations in the apex of the left upper lobe measuring 11.1 cm (AP) x 9.5 cm (T) x 10.9 cm (CC) in size.\n\n【14】A day after his admission, the neurological symptoms had started to regress and his left upper limb weakness had subsided. Since the patient was not having any respiratory complaint or compromise, the patient was observed for a few days without any change in his respiratory system. The patient was saturating well on room air. An option for bullectomy was brought up but the patient refused as he saw himself as fit. He was counseled on the complications of the disease and was discharged. He has been lost to follow-up.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Patients with giant lung bulla typically present with sudden onset difficulty in breathing or chest pain with suspicion of tension pneumothorax \\[ 1 \\], but rarely loss of consciousness. Our case describes a healthy middle-aged non-smoker without prior history of lung disease presenting with loss of consciousness during an air flight. In chronic pulmonary disease, a patient may have poor lung ventilation or pulmonary hypertension which may contribute to a decline of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) with hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction \\[ 2 \\]. In healthy people, vasoconstriction redistributes pulmonary blood flow to the lung apex, which may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which could help to maintain the PaO <sub>2 </sub> during air travel \\[ 3 \\]. Since the left lung apex was compromised in our case, this might have led to a hypoxic event hence loss of consciousness. However, there have been reports of ruptured giant lung bulla during air travel. In such circumstances, the air enters the blood circulation causing cerebral air embolism and neurological deficit such as loss of consciousness and stroke \\[ 4 \\]. In our case, the patient had a facial asymmetry with left arm weakness which may have been attributed to a cerebral air embolism although the brain CT was normal. The left-arm weakness may be neuropathic through a direct pressure effect upon the brachial plexus from the expanding bulla \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【17】As altitude increases, both atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen and barometric pressure decrease. At 10668 meters (35 000 feet), the actual atmospheric pressure is 179 mmHg, whereas pressurization of the cabin on commercial airliners maintains cabin atmospheric pressures around 564 mmHg (2438 meters/8000 feet). There is an approximate 38% increase in the volume of air in a non-communicating body cavity upon ascent from sea level to the maintained cabin atmospheric pressure \\[ 6 \\]. As Boyle’s law states the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is exposed, therefore, as barometric pressure falls in the aircraft cabin during the ascent, the bulla will expand. The expanded bulla will stretch its wall and compress the surrounding lung causing rupture of the bulla, pneumothorax, and air embolism causing respiratory or neurological complications \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【18】Lung bullae are best detected on CT imaging as it gives more description on the number, size, and position \\[ 8 \\]. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in previous literature though it is rare \\[ 9 \\]. Eventually, bullectomy is recommended in symptomatic patients with giant lung bulla \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【19】In conclusion, giant lung bulla is a rare cause of loss of consciousness. Though an air embolus was not detected on brain CT imaging, it was likely a hypoxic event that led to the loss of consciousness in our case. This may be suspected when patients lose consciousness during air travel.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【21】We thank the patient for his patience and cooperation.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】The need for ethical approval was waived.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】A.S. is the nominated guarantor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The majority type of LCH is a single-system disease that may involve a limited number of organs, most common in skin and bone \\[ 4 \\]. The multi-system disease affects multiple organs, most commonly skin, bone, lymph nodes, thymus, lungs, pituitary gland, liver, spleen, bone marrow and central nervous system, that cause organ dysfunction \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 20-month-old boy was referred to the Pediatric clinic for recurrent pulmonary infections. He was the first child in the family, born at term weighing 4 kg, following a normal pregnancy. There were no concerns in the neonatal period. At 10 months old, he suffered from fever measured at (39.5–40)°C at a rate of 2 to 3 times daily, partly controlled with antipyretic, associated with difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the pediatric department for 72 days. During admission, he had extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and needed oxygen. He was diagnosed with staphylococcal pneumonia and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. At 14 months old, he was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks with a lung infection requiring an invasive ventilator for 1 week. There was not any other medical, surgical or family history. He was passive exposure to tobacco smoke. The child underwent all the compulsory immunizations recommended for his age. On physical examination, his body weight was 14 kg (90.32%), length was 85 cm (58.706%), temperature 39°C, oxygen Saturation 95%, arterial blood pressure was 90/55 mm Hg, he was vitally stable and generally well. The patient underwent multiple investigations that showed hypochromic microcytic anemia \\[Hb 10 g/dl, MCV 59 fl\\] with an inflammatory response \\[C- reactive protein (CRP) 52 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84 mm at the end of 1st hour\\]. Other investigations including hepatic and renal function, blood glucose, and blood gas urinary investigations were normal. Chest X-Ray showed cloudy bilateral infiltrations ( Fig. 1 ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue ( Fig. 2 ). Echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), abdominal ultrasound, and direct investigation of Bacillus Koch in sputum on three-morning samples were performed that were normal. Pulmonary pressure was normal. Cystic fibrosis mutations, Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM) and alpha 1 Antitrypsin were normal.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Chest-X-Ray demonstrating bilateral hazy infiltrates.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bulging cysts, bronchiectasis with significant damage on the pulmonary tissue.\n\n【12】During the hospitalization, subcutaneous emphysema appeared in the neck ( Fig. 3 ) with nearly confluent erythematous macules and papules like seborrhea dermatitis appeared throughout the scalp and expanded to the back and abdomen ( Fig. 4 ). Histologic examination of a punch biopsy obtained which showed focal surface erosion with diffuse and nodular dermal infiltration by atypical relatively large cells, histiocytic like, with moderate eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm and slightly irregular or grooved nuclei. Some areas of the tumor show significant mitotic activity. Most of the tumor cells are found to be positive for S100 protein, and numerous ones of tumor cells are positive for CD68 that would confirm the diagnosis for LCH. CT scan for pelvic and abdominal showed splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. X-Ray of the lower, upper limb and spine were normal.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】CX-Ray showed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck.\n\n【16】**Figure 4**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】nearly confluent erythematous macules and papules like seborrhea dermatitis appeared throughout the scalp.\n\n【19】Based on previous data, the patient was diagnosed with Histiocytosis X systemic type (LSD). The patient was treated with weekly Vp16 (150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), vinblastine (6 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and daily oral prednisone (2 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) for a total of 6 weeks. At this stage, the disease was in a regressive state and the patient proceeded to the second-line continuation chemotherapy consisting of three drugs (oral prednisone pulses, every three  weeks vinblastine and etoposide \\[Vp16\\]). He completed the 52 weeks of the continuation phase, and recent imaging confirmed that he still has the non-active disease.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】LCH is an unknown etiology, with several hypotheses that investigate whether it has a neoplastic or inflammatory origin, immunological, genetic or infectious (mainly viral) as triggering factor \\[ 5 \\]. Historically, the first case of LSD was described by Letterer in 1924 and then defined the clinic pathological syndrome by Siwe in 1933 \\[ 6 \\]. LSD usually appears within the first two years of life as cutaneous lesions in the scalp, face, thorax and perineum that are similar to seborrheic dermatitis. Many systemic symptoms may include ear drainage, anemia, fever, lymphadenopathy, osteolytic lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung involvement \\[ 5 \\]. Pulmonary LCH (PLCH) includes cough, tachypnea, cyanosis, clubbing, hemoptysis or it may be asymptomatic. Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema are lower incidences in infancy compared with adults \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【22】In our case report, the pulmonary symptoms (recurrent pulmonary infections, subcutaneous emphysema) were the predominant symptoms, then the cutaneous lesions appeared and this considers rare in the literature. In the early stage of PLCH, chest X-ray reveals diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltration, symmetric linear and nodular opacities that develop in the later stage to cystic, bullous formation and pneumothorax \\[ 8 \\]. Although the condition is not chronic in our patient, damage to the pulmonary tissue was significant. The diagnosis is detected through the lung or other affected tissues biopsy that appears accumulation of Langerhans cells with variable numbers of eosinophils. Langerhans cells are immunohistochemically positive with antibodies to S-100 protein and CD1a \\[ 1 \\]. Treatment of LSD depends on the number of organs affected. The treatment ranges from minimal therapy to intensive chemotherapy (Vinblastine and etoposide) associated with corticosteroids \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【23】In summary, this was a rare case report of LSD with unusual clinical presentation. The diagnosis was based on histological examination and immunophenotyping of the biopsied tissue. The patient was treated with chemotherapy with full remission.\n\n【24】AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIAL\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【26】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【27】All authors have read and approved the manuscript.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】We wish to thank the medical officer, doctors in the Pediatric department, and laboratory assistants in the Tishreen Hospital laboratory.\n\n【30】COMPETING INTEREST STATEMENTS\n-----------------------------\n\n【31】All of the authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】No funding was obtained for this study.\n\n【34】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【35】This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee Tishreen university hospital, Lattakia, Syria.\n\n【36】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

In most cases, RV thrombus develops in patients with RV dysfunction and concomitant thrombosis in the systemic veins. However, RV thrombosis can rarely present as an isolated intracardiac mass and in the presence of preserved RV function, particularly in patients with thrombophilic states \\[ 2 \\]. We describe an unusual case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow tract obstruction in a patient with renal carcinoma.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department complaining chest discomfort and dyspnea. His cardiovascular history was unremarkable except for smoking and emphysema. Seven weeks earlier, because of persistent fever, cough and evidence of anemia, he had undergone chest–abdomen computed tomography (CT), with evidence of a solid mass (7 × 6.5 cm) in the left kidney. Brain CT scan, bone scintigraphy, colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy had shown no significant findings. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had been submitted to left radical nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. An echocardiogram performed at the time of the intervention had shown no significant abnormalities. The patient had been discharged 6 days after surgery, with the recommendation of continuing enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, lansoprazole, folic acid and antalgic treatment with oxycodone/naloxone and paracetamol/codeine.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was in poor general conditions, his pulse rate was 135 beats/min, and blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood examinations showed leucocytosis (23.29×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: 4.40–10.10×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), anemia (Hb 8.8 g/dL, normal range: 13.2–17.0 g/dL), thrombocytosis (734×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: <150–400×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), and increased C-reactive protein (46.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia–hypocapnia. Ultrasound examination showed no evidence of venous thrombosis. Echocardiography showed a large mass (56 × 33 mm) attached to the anterior wall of the RV outflow tract, characterized by irregular shape, inhomogeneous echogenicity, and no evidence of vascularization (Fig. 1 , Movies 1–4 ). Doppler examination of RV outflow tract showed a peak subpulmonary gradient of 21 mmHg at rest. During forced expiration, the peak gradient increased up to 35 mmHg (Fig. 2 , Movies 5 ), suggesting dynamic RV outflow obstruction. There were also right atrial and ventricular enlargement with preserved systolic function (TAPSE 24 mm, tricuspid s’ 19 cm/s), severe tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension (52 mmHg), and reduced inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava. CT pulmonary angiography (Fig. 3 ) confirmed the presence of a large mass obstructing the RV outflow tract, with irregular shape and no evidence of vascularization, suggesting RV thrombus. There were no emboli in the pulmonary vessels, but multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases were observed. No thrombosis was found in the systemic veins. Because of the recent history of surgery and the oncological prognosis, thrombolysis or surgery were not indicated. The patient was hospitalized and therapy with full-dose enoxaparin, fluids, antibiotics and steroids was started. Ten days after admission, an echocardiogram showed no significant changes, except for a mild improvement in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (moderate) and a slight reduction in mass dimensions (52 × 30 mm) and RV outflow tract gradient at rest (16 mmHg). The patient was discharged 1 week later on anticoagulation, but died 2 days thereafter.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Echocardiographic images showing the right ventricular mass (white arrows) from the long-axis parasternal view ( **A** ), short-axis parasternal views ( **B** and **C** ), and parasternal right ventricular inflow view ( **D** ).

The detection of an isolated RV thrombus is a relatively rare event in patients with preserved RV systolic function, particularly when not associated with concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. Isolated RV thrombi have been reported in the setting of RV myocardial infarction and arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia \\[ 3 \\], Beçhet disease \\[ 4 \\] and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome \\[ 5 \\]. While neoplasms are associated with a thrombophilic state that increases the risk of cardiovascular events, isolated RV thrombi in cancer patients have been rarely described, in most cases resulting from extensive tumor-thrombus venous propagation \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【18】This report describes a case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to RV outflow tract obstruction following left radical nephrectomy in a patient with renal carcinoma. Several atypical aspects should be pointed out in this case. First, the clinical presentation with acute heart failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow obstruction \\[ 7 \\]. Second, the lack of thrombotic involvement of the systemic venous district, which in cancer patients commonly represents the pathway for thrombus propagation to the right ventricle. Third, the development of a large RV thrombus despite an apparently appropriate dose of enoxaparin, equal to that currently recommended by the 2014 ASCO guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis \\[ 8 \\]. Lastly, the evidence of a rapid thrombus formation despite preserved RV systolic function, which highlights the importance of thrombophilic states in the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombi \\[ 2 \\]. On the other hand, although the echocardiographic and CT characteristics of the mass support its thrombotic nature, autopsy was not performed, so that no histological confirmation is available. Contrast echocardiography is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses, and could have provided additional information about the avascularity of the mass \\[ 9 \\]. It is also worthy of note that, for patients with no evidence of a concomitant acute cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism), to date there are no specific guidelines for the management of intracardiac thrombi, and the relative efficacy of anticoagulation, thrombolysis or other approaches is still unclear \\[ 10 \\]. Lastly, while the negativity of CT angiography makes the hypothesis of concomitant pulmonary embolism unlikely, this possibility cannot be completely excluded.\n\n【19】We believe that these issues could suggest clinical implications. The possibility of a RV outflow obstruction due to an isolated thrombus should be considered in patients with acute RV failure, even when there is no concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. This may be particularly important in patients with neoplasms or other conditions associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Bedside echocardiography plays a fundamental role for prompt assessment in this context. Lastly, the effectiveness of standard prophylactic doses of enoxaparin might be reduced in patients with prothrombotic states.\n\n【20】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【21】Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【23】None.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】There were no sources of funding for this article.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】Not needed for this type of article.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Written informed consent to publish this case was obtained.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】All authors are the guarantors of this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Its perioperative use is associated with reduced pain scores and an opioid sparing effect. Management of postoperative pain in patients with a history of chronic opioid use can be challenging. Multimodal analgesia is recommended although the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine has not been extensively studied in this patient population. We present a case of intractable abdominal pain following open abdominoperineal resection in a patient with rectal cancer and a history of chronic opioid use. Following the introduction of dexmedetomidine into the patient’s postoperative epidural solution, a noticeable decline in reported pain scores and use of breakthrough analgesia was appreciated. The analgesic efficacy of epidural dexmedetomidine in patients with a history of chronic opioid use warrants further study.\n\n【2】dexmedetomidine , epidural , analgesia , postoperative pain\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2 adrenergic agonist with known sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic properties \\[ 1 \\]. The perioperative analgesic use of dexmedetomidine has been examined demonstrating benefits with intravenous, intrathecal and epidural administration \\[ 2–4 \\]. Of particular interest is its opioid sparing effect \\[ 2 \\] as its use is not associated with significant apneic episodes \\[ 1 \\]. Managing postoperative pain in patients with a history of chronic opioid use can be particularly challenging as their dose–response to analgesics can be heavily altered \\[ 5 \\], and escalating doses of opioids in themselves can cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia \\[ 6 \\]. We report the analgesic use of dexmedetomidine in an epidural infusion postoperatively in a patient with a history of chronic opioid use and intractable postoperative pain following abdominoperineal resection (APR).\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 48-year-old male presented with a diagnosis of rectal cancer for a laparoscopic-assisted APR. His only comorbidity was chronic abdominal pain related to his diagnosis. He was managing his pain with the use of illicit opioids calculated between 350 and 500 mg oral morphine equivalents daily, taken as a combination of hydromorphone, hydromorph contin and oxycodone. He had been consuming opioids for ~4 months prior to presenting for APR. He was brought to the operating room and a pre-induction thoracic epidural was placed at the level of T8. Induction of anesthesia was uneventful, and maintenance was achieved with a volatile anesthetic, ketamine infusion of 0.3 mg/kg/hour IV and thoracic epidural infusion of bupivacaine 0.125%, hydromorphone 10 mcg/ml and epinephrine 1: 200 k infusing at 14 mls/hour. Approximately 2 hours into the case the surgeon converted to an open technique with a mid-line laparotomy incision. Hydromorphone boluses of 0.5 mg were given at the anesthesiologist discretion for a total dose of 4.5 mg over 5.5 hours. Surgical resection was successful and emergence was uneventful.\n\n【7】The patient was seen twice daily by the Acute Pain Service (APS) who managed his postoperative analgesia. His epidural was continued at 16 mls/hour and an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was initiated for breakthrough pain. The PCA solution was a combination of hydromorphone 0.5 mg/ml plus ketamine 0.2 mg/ml with the following settings: bolus of 0.5 mg hydromorphone with a 6-minute lockout to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/hour hydromorphone (2.0 mg of ketamine). His surgeon requested strict nil per os (NPO) and nothing per rectum, limiting the adjuncts available for pain control.\n\n【8】The morning of postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient reported his pain as 9/10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS). The pain was described as a deep abdominal burning sensation. His level of sensory blockade was T6 to L1 bilaterally. He had received a total of 10.5 mg of hydromorphone and 4.2 mg of ketamine PCA solution with 18 denied attempts overnight. In an attempt to further optimize his pain control, the epidural was bolused 5 mls and the basal rate was increased to 20 mls/hour. Post epidural bolus, his NRS was 8 and he felt some relief. Reassessment of his epidural block level noted no change in coverage. At this time, a basal rate was added to his PCA of 0.5 mg/hour hydromorphone and 0.2 mg/hour of ketamine, and the remainder of his PCA settings were left unchanged.\n\n【9】On the morning of POD 2, the patient again rated his NRS at 9. His PCA usage including denied attempts from overnight can be seen in Fig. 1 . His epidural was changed at this time to a more concentrated solution of bupivacaine 0.2%, hydromorphone 10 mcg/ml and epinephrine 1: 200 k. A 5-ml epidural bolus was given and the basal rate of 20 mls/hour was maintained. That afternoon, his NRS was rated 7 with little change in his PCA usage. At this time, a 5 mg bolus of preservative-free morphine was given epidurally.\n\n【10】**Figure 1**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】PCA use POD 1–7. Dark blue—delivered attempts. Light blue—denied attempts.\n\n【13】The morning of POD 3, the patient rated his NRS at 8 noting only small reduction in pain overnight. Concerningly, the patient was refusing to ambulate because of discomfort. At this time, the APS decided to add dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/ml to the epidural solution. A 5-ml epidural bolus was given and a basal rate of 20 mls/hour was continued. That afternoon, the patient rated his NRS at 7, with a noticed reduction in the number of denied attempts in his PCA ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【14】Between POD 4 and POD 7, a noticeable decline in the patient’s PCA use can be seen ( Fig. 1 ). Further, a downward trend in his NRS score is also noted during this interval ( Fig. 2 ). Over this time, his epidural was titrated down while maintaining an NRS of 5 or less and was eventually discontinued on POD 7. His PCA basal rate was discontinued on POD 5 and PCA discontinued on POD 7 entirely. Additionally, the patient was able to begin ambulation and physiotherapy on POD5. The patient was successfully transitioned to an oral analgesic regimen before being discharged from hospital.\n\n【15】**Figure 2**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】NRS pain score from POD 1 to 7.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Dexmedetomidine has been established as an effective co-analgesic agent via multiple routes of delivery \\[ 2–4 \\]. Postoperative dexmedetomidine epidural infusions have been shown in thoracotomy patients to be associated with lower pain scores and significantly reduced PCA use \\[ 7 \\]. This same finding has been demonstrated in patient’s undergoing laparotomy for abdominal cancer surgery \\[ 3 \\] and colonic resection \\[ 8 \\]. Further, in these studies, it was also shown that patients receiving epidural dexmedetomidine had significantly increased time to first postoperative analgesic request \\[ 3 \\] and significantly reduced time to first flatus and bowel movement following surgery \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【20】We present the postoperative epidural use of dexmedetomidine in a patient with rectal cancer and opioid dependence, a population group where dexmedetomidine has not been specifically studied \\[ 6 \\]. Patients with a history of significant opioid use are often excluded from studies adding to the challenge of research informed perioperative pain management in this population \\[ 5 \\]. It is known that inadequate postoperative pain control is associated with adverse events including myocardial ischemia, impaired respiratory function and thromboembolic events \\[ 6 \\]. Escalating doses of opioids in these patients has been associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia \\[ 6 \\], and a multimodal approach to pain management is recommended to reduce opioid escalation \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【21】In our case, we considered it reasonable to trial the addition of dexmedetomidine to the patient’s epidural solution as his pain was seemingly refractory to his mainly opioid-based regimen. Furthermore, opioid-induced hyperalgesia was felt to be a significant contributor to the etiology of the patient’s refractory pain, and thus, additional opioid analgesia would unlikely be effective while increasing the risk of adverse effects. The relatively rapid response of the patient’s pain to the epidural dexmedetomidine is consistent with what has been previously reported in the literature. Adverse effects associated with the use of dexmedetomidine include reduced cardiac output, hypotension, sedation and reduced respiratory rate \\[ 1 \\]. None of these effects were noted in any significance in our patient by bedside nursing according to APS monitoring protocols.\n\n【22】In summary, we report a case whereby the use of epidural dexmedetomidine in an opioid-dependent patient produced rapid control of the patient’s refractory postoperative pain from an APR. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to elucidate the role of neuraxial dexmedetomidine in postoperative analgesia for opioid-dependent patients.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【24】We would like to thank Terry Robertshaw, NP and Savanah Prete, NP for their exceptional patient care.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【26】We report no conflicts of interest.\n\n【27】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【28】We did not receive funding for this report.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【31】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【32】Patient consent was obtained before writing this case report.\n\n【33】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【34】Mathew P.

The syndrome frequently involves digestive system besides other visceral organs such as liver, lungs, thyroid gland, spleen and nervous system. We present a case of a 36-year-old female with Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus that involved skin and musculoskeletal system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The rare BRBNS (Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome) was first reported by Gascoyen in 1860 \\[ 1 \\]. It is characterized by malformations in the venous system of the skin and visceral organs. These malformations could be severe enough to cause bleeding and death. The malformations inhabit the skin in 93% of cases manifesting as button-like bluish papules and the gastrointestinal tract in 76% of cases causing bleeding, iron-deficiency anaemia and further complications such as torsion and intussusception \\[ 1 \\]. Symptoms can vary depending on the organ involved. Vascular lesions in the nervous system may cause infarctions and bleeding, while respiratory involvement may include hemoptysis. Only 200 cases of the same syndrome were reported so far. Cancerous lesions have not been reported \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】Diagnosis is mainly clinically supported by different modalities. Depending on the patient’s presentation and suspicion, the CBC is used to look for anaemia and faecal occult blood could be used to look for bleeding digestive system lesions. Dark urine will necessitate a urine test as bladder lesions could be the cause. Other radiological diagnostics are obtained depending on the specific manifestation, and for instance, musculoskeletal complaints may indicate the need for a simple X-ray or an MRI, while gastrointestinal incidents may require a CT or an endoscopy \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【5】Histopathological findings include a vascular network of dilated tortuous blood-filled vessels, lined up with a single layer of endothelial cells, surrounded by a delicate connective tissue \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【6】There is no curative treatment. Systemic steroids are used to control intestinal growth. Interferon-alpha is used to treat coagulopathies. Surgical interventions (Surgical excision) or electrocauterization and cryosurgery are only used to excise symptomatic lesions and for cosmetic considerations \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 36-year-old female nurse from a remote rural area in Syria without significant medical or family history presented to the Department of Dermatology of Damascus University with skin complaints of ‘deep blue pimples’ and rubbery consistency masses under her skin in different parts of the body.\n\n【9】As described by the patient, the lesions started appearing right after birth as pigmented papules disseminated on the back and extremities. The papules grew gradually to form nodules and small tumours that bleed easily when exposed to trauma. Nodules also erupted on mucous membranes and the ones on the tongue and tonsils were surgically removed due to dysphagia and discomfort they caused the patient. The lesions kept appearing until the patient reached 20 years of age. In addition to the papules, the patient noticed the appearance of soft masses of different sizes under the skin, some of which was tender.\n\n【10】Physical examination of the patient revealed a pigmented brown-blue patch on the back ( Fig. 1 ), several pigmented papules on the palms and soles ( Figs 2 and 3 ), soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue ( Figs 4 and 5 ) in addition to several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the right forearm ( Fig. 6 ) and back ( Fig. 7 ) that were tender to touch and not attached to the overlying skin.\n\n【11】Figure 1\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】A pigmented brown-blue patch on the back (8 mm × 7 mm).\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.\n\n【17】Figure 3\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Several pigmented papules on the palms and soles.\n\n【20】Figure 4\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.\n\n【23】The patient did not suffer from any anaemia that was due to the CBC laboratory examination.\n\n【24】Apart from the scars of previous surgical excisions, the rest of the physical examination was normal including the lymph nodes, hair and nails.\n\n【25】Additionally, the patient reported musculoskeletal complaints of bone and joint pain for which an MRI was ordered only to disclose multiple tumours occupying the muscles of the forearm ( Fig. 9 ).\n\n【26】Figure 5\n\n【27】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【28】Soft blue rubbery nodules on the tongue.\n\n【29】Figure 6\n\n【30】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【31】Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumors on the right forearm (8 cm × 4 cm).\n\n【32】Figure 7\n\n【33】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【34】Several mobile soft rubbery subcutaneous tumours on the back (MAX: 8 × 3, MIN: 4 × 3).\n\n【35】Figure 8\n\n【36】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【37】Hematoxylin and eosin slide took from a biopsy from an excided papule.\n\n【38】Figure 9\n\n【39】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【40】Showing the forearm MRI.\n\n【41】At the age of 6, a biopsy was performed on one of the excised lesions by a dermatologist ( Fig. 8 ). Histological findings described by the pathologist were large dilated vessels in the lower dermis and the subcutaneous tissue accompanied by capillary vascular dilatations in the upper dermis. These findings of a cavernous vascular tumour combined with the overall presentation consider BRBNS, also previously referred to as Bean Syndrome.\n\n【42】The patient was offered cryosurgery or electrocauterization to remove bothersome lesions as she wishes.\n\n【43】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【44】To differentiate this diagnosis from similar diseases and syndromes, we compared the specifications of our case with six other entities: Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis, Familial glomangiomatosis, Maffucci syndrome, Kaposi sarcoma and Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber syndrome \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【45】Absent at birth and developing during the first weeks of life, the Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis is characterized by multifocal tumours up to 20 mm in size that grows rapidly and regresses spontaneously without sequela when confined only to the skin. The tumours could form in the liver, lungs or nervous system, causing symptoms of obstructive jaundice, heart and lung failure, or intracerebral haemorrhage. The mortality rate is high in untreated individuals. Only large symptomatic lesions should be excised. Histopathology reveals endothelial cell hyperplasia in a lobular form, mast cells and a prominent basement membrane. Upon regression, lipofibromatous tissue is seen with mast cells \\[ 4 \\]. Our patient started developing skin lesions at birth which did not regress spontaneously, so the diagnosis of Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis was unlikely.\n\n【46】While being not congenital, Familial Glomangiomatosis manifests with hard (not rubbery) dark blue papules and nodules clustered in groups with less mucosal involvement. The lesions usually start in young children and are less likely to cause symptoms. Some patients report pain episodes elicited by menstruation and pregnancy. The biopsy findings could catch the diagnosis as they show venous malformation of glomus cells surrounding irregular veins \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【47】The genetic syndrome of Maffuci generally shows a manifestation at the age of 4–5 years old with cartilage tumours and vascular anomalies including spindle cell endothelial tumours. The nodules are tender and asymmetric, localized more on the distal extremities. The hemangiomas could be superficial or deep. The probability for chondrosarcoma is possible around the age of 40 \\[ 6 \\]. Our patient’s age on symptom onset and that she was having central lesions on her trunk and in her oral cavity did not fit the classical picture of Maffuci syndrome.\n\n【48】In contrast to our patient who had several lesions, Klippel–Trenaunay–Weber presents with one large vascular nevus, mostly on the thigh, knee or leg, with overlying lymphatic bullae that could bleed after puberty. The syndrome also has bone and connective tissue hypertrophy with varicose veins that may or may not accompany deep venous anomalies. Doppler ultrasound is used to diagnose this syndrome along with MRI \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【49】The nodular type of Kaposi Sarcoma can manifest in older males as lesions mainly on lower extremities and rarely on the face or torso. The lesions can be symmetric with accompanying lymphedema. Hyperkeratotic overlying skin can be seen with a chance of malignancy in the advanced lesions. The biopsy shows bland spindle cells forming slit-like spaces occupied by red blood cells \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【50】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【51】Our case represents one of the rarest vascular syndromes where only skin, mucous membranes and musculoskeletal systems were involved. The importance of the biopsy is not to be forgotten in combination with the clinical assessment being put in the picture of the whole presentation, such as the age and the progression. Patient education and life-long follow-up are essential to detect probable more dangerous manifestations which might be life-threatening such as gastrointestinal and neurological manifestations.\n\n【52】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【53】There are no acknowledgements.\n\n【54】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【55】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【56】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【57】No funding resources.\n\n【58】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【59】Ethical approval was also taken from the Faculty of Medicine at Damascus University.\n\n【60】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【61】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【62】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【63】Ayham Badran.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In the immunocompromised patient, however, infections from unusual pathogens should also be considered. We describe the case of a 66-year-old male with a history of renal transplant who was diagnosed with flexor tenosynovitis by point-of-care ultrasound. Although initial wound cultures were negative, subsequent microbiological testing led to the underlying cause, a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Among patients presenting with evidence of forearm or hand infection, infectious flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) is an important diagnosis to consider, as failure to detect this condition may lead to severe morbidity and loss of hand function. The most common causes include _Streptococcus_ and _Staphylococcus_ species, including methicillin-resistant _Staph. aureus_ (MRSA), which may be introduced via a number of routes, including local trauma, contiguous spread or hematogenous spread \\[ 1 \\]. Diagnosis of FTS has typically been based on physical examination, including the use of Kanavel’s signs (tenderness of the flexor tendon sheath, affected finger held in flexion, the presence of fusiform swelling and pain on passive extension) \\[ 2 \\]. More recently, however, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has also been shown to be a rapid, effective adjunct for the diagnosis of FTS \\[ 3 \\]. We present an atypical case of FTS in an immunocompromised patient diagnosed with the aid of POCUS, complicated by the presence of a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 66-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and renal transplant presented to the emergency department with several months of left hand swelling and pain. He denied any recent trauma or animal bites to his hand or arm.\n\n【6】On physical examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs. The fingers of his left hand were held in moderate flexion. He had swelling and tenderness of the volar distal forearm, hand and fingers, with pain on active and passive finger extension. No erythema and warmth were present. Sensation was intact with the exception of paresthesias of the distal fifth finger. Radial and ulnar pulses were intact.\n\n【7】Laboratory evaluation was notable for the absence of leukocytosis (white blood cell count 5.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) although C-reactive protein was elevated at 14.5 mg/L. Hand radiographs were unremarkable. A POCUS was performed using a high-frequency linear-array transducer on a Zonare ultrasound system (Zonare Medical Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) which demonstrated a large complex fluid collection surrounding the flexor tendons of the left mid-forearm extending to the volar aspect of the left hand ( Fig. 1 ). Fluid was also noted surrounding the flexor tendons of the left index finger ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】In this transverse ultrasound view of the patient’s left palm, complex fluid (white arrows) is seen within the synovial sheath surrounding the paired flexor tendons. Also note the hypoechoic fluid in the midpalmar space (arrowhead) superficial to the metacarpals (mc).\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】In this longitudinal ultrasound image, complex fluid (white arrows) is seen both superficial and deep to the flexors of the patient’s index finger. Note the ragged appearance of the flexor tendon (black arrow).\n\n【14】Following plastic surgery consultation, the patient was taken to the operating room for exploration, drainage and release of the left carpal tunnel. Operative findings included an extensive cavity of tenacious yellow/clear fluid with solid components extending from the left volar forearm through the carpal tunnel to the palm and volar thumb ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Intraoperative photo of the patient’s volar wrist and hand. Note the thick yellowish material adjacent to the surgeon’s finger as well as in the thenar eminence (arrows).\n\n【18】Blood, fluid and tissue cultures were sent, including gram-positive, gram-negative, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and fungal assays. The patient was empirically started on IV vancomycin, cefepime and fluconazole.\n\n【19】All initial cultures were negative, and preliminary AFB smear was negative. Three weeks later, wound culture results were positive for _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC). Further patient evaluation revealed the presence of a peripheral lung nodule with nodularity and cavitary changes concerning for atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient’s clinical course was complicated by the need for further operative debridement for residual MAC disease 5 months later. He was discharged on a 6- to 12-month course of azithromycin, rifabutin and ethambutol, as well as hand therapy.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】FTS is defined as inflammation of the tendon and synovial sheath and most frequently occurs in the upper extremities. Potential complications may include carpal tunnel syndrome, compartment syndrome, and even tissue necrosis requiring amputation \\[ 4 \\]. FTS in immunocompromised patients may be caused by common skin flora or, as in our case, by more unusual pathogens. The broader differential diagnosis in patients with suspected infectious tenosynovitis should include infectious causes such as staphylococcus, streptococcus and mycobacterial infection as well as noninfectious causes such as injury, autoimmune or inflammatory tenosynovitis.\n\n【22】Soft tissue infections involving the wrist and palm may spread through the synovial sheaths that surround the flexor tendons of the hand. The common flexor sheath (also known as the ulnar bursa) contains the superficial and deep flexor tendons of the fingers, except for flexor pollicis longus, which is contained within a separate synovial sheath, the radial bursa. The ulnar and radial bursa communicate in 50–85% of patients \\[ 5 \\], which may facilitate the progression of FTS to involve not only the palmar flexors but also the thumb, as in this case, requiring a separate thumb incision and debridement.\n\n【23】Ultrasonography has increasingly been recognized as a valuable imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with suspected FTS \\[ 6 \\]. On ultrasound examination, complex hypoechoic or anechoic fluid may be seen surrounding the flexor tendons within the fingers as well as in the hand and wrist, as in our case. After FTS is identified, urgent surgical consultation should be obtained and empiric antimicrobial and antifungal treatment initiated \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】MAC is an indolent mycobacterial infection that is generally encountered in immunocompromised patients and most often presents with pulmonary involvement. Diagnosis is made through blood or body fluid cultures, such as sputum samples. Treatment may be prolonged and involves a three-drug regimen that is often at least 12 months in duration \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【25】A recent review of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the hand demonstrated several common characteristics, including need for surgical debridement, delay in microbiologic diagnosis (mean 4.9 weeks after surgery) followed by a prolonged course of antimycobacterial therapy. Recurrence was rare although ~ 20% of patients had long-term sequelae including pain, stiffness and swelling \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【26】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【27】In this case, POCUS played an important role in the diagnosis of FTS in a patient with minimal physical exam findings, expediting the initiation of appropriate therapy and operative intervention. A comprehensive approach to confirming the patient’s microbiologic diagnosis, including bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial assays, ensured that this unusual pathogen, and its atypical presentation, would not go undetected.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【31】No conflicts of interest are reported.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】None.\n\n【34】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【35】No approval is required for this case report.\n\n【36】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【37】A signed patient consent form was obtained and is available on request.\n\n【38】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【39】David C.

Here, we report a case of bacterial keratitis caused by _Shewanella algae_ without marine exposure. A 66-year-old man with suspected pneumonia was sent to the emergency department from a nursing hospital. He had been in there for 2 years in a vegetative state and could not close his eyes voluntarily. Neither the patient nor his family had experienced any marine exposure. Keratitis was suspected in his right eye. Gram-negative rods grew from swab culture and identified as _S. algae_ by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA sequencing. The patient was treated with topical tobramycin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin as well as steroids for 14 days, and the keratitis improved. _S. algae_ is a rare human pathogen, and most human infections involve marine exposure. This is the second report of bacterial keratitis caused by _S. algae_ worldwide and the first in Asia.\n\n【2】Shewanella algae , bacterial keratitis , marine , human pathogen\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】_Shewanella_ spp. are facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative, motile rods first described by Derby and Hammer in 1931 \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. They are typical marine pathogens found in marine, cold water environments and deep sea sediments \\[ 3 \\]. Human infections by _Shewanella_ spp. are very rare, although the number of reports has increased recently \\[ 4 \\]. Most human infections caused by _Shewanella_ spp. have a marine association, such as infection from trauma while fishing. There are more than 20 known _Shewanella_ species. The species reported most frequently as human pathogens are _Shewanella putrefaciens_ and _S. algae_ \\[ 4 \\]. Since first identification of _S. algae_ in 1992, various human infections caused by _S. algae_ have been published worldwide, including bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infection, peritonitis, pericarditis and bone infections \\[ 4 \\]. In Korea, reported _S. algae_ infections have caused endophthalmitis, tenosynovitis, peritonitis and bacteremia \\[ 5–7 \\]; all cases were related to marine environments, including trauma while fishing, slipping on the beach and eating raw fish. Here, we report a case of keratitis caused by multi-drug-resistant _S. algae_ that was not related to a marine environment.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 66-year-old man was sent to the emergency department from a nursing hospital because of desaturation. He had been hospitalized for more than 2 years in an unconscious state due to a cervical spine injury. He was unable to close his eyes voluntarily. Neither the patient nor his family had a history of marine exposure. At admission, pneumonia was suspected, and conjunctival injection, purulent discharge and central white opacity were detected in his right eye. He was admitted to the respiratory department, and treatment with piperacillin–tazobactam was started for pneumonia. An ophthalmologist examined the patient at the bedside. Examination of his right eye revealed 6.0 × 5.0 mm corneal opacity and hyphema with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination was impossible due to corneal haziness. Corneal swabs were sent for Gram staining, bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing, KOH mount smear and fungal culture. Empirical treatment with tobramycin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin eye drops was started. The KOH smear and Gram stain were negative. After a 2-day incubation, medium-sized gray and dark pink colonies grew on blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate ( Fig. 1 ). Other types of colony did not grow on the plate. _S. algae_ was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Vitek system (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). 16S rRNA sequencing revealed 99.93% (1410/1411 bp) identity with _S. algae_ JCM 21037(T) (GenBank accession number BALO01000089 ). Susceptibility testing of the isolate indicated susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, colistin and gentamicin, resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and intermediate to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and meropenem. We added steroid eye drops to control the inflammation and continued the antibiotic eye drops. After 14 days, his keratitis had improved.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】_Shewanella algae_ colonies grown on chocolate (left) and blood (right) agar plates.\n\n【10】Table 1\n\n【11】Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n【12】| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | \\[ 11 \\] |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | \\[ 7 \\] |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | \\[ 9 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | \\[ 12 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | \\[ 9 \\] |\n\n【13】| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | \\[ 11 \\] |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | \\[ 7 \\] |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | \\[ 9 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | \\[ 12 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | \\[ 9 \\] |\n\n【14】Open in new tab\n\n【15】Table 1\n\n【16】Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n【17】| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | \\[ 11 \\] |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | \\[ 7 \\] |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | \\[ 9 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | \\[ 12 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | \\[ 9 \\] |\n\n【18】| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | \\[ 11 \\] |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | \\[ 7 \\] |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | \\[ 9 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | \\[ 12 \\] |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | \\[ 9 \\] |\n\n【19】Open in new tab\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】Microbial keratitis is inflammation of the cornea caused by bacteria, fungi, or protists. The main causative bacteria are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Serratia_ species \\[ 8 \\]. Bacterial keratitis caused by _Shewanella_ species is extremely rare. Only one case of _S. algae_ infection has been reported worldwide; this was in the USA in 2019 \\[ 9 \\]. In Korea, there has been one case of _S. algae_ endophthalmitis but no reported keratitis cases \\[ 7 \\]. We report the second case of _S. algae_ keratitis worldwide and the first in Asia. Colonies of _Shewanella_ species on medium are convex, circular, and smooth and produce an unusual brown to tan pigment, in contrast to the white colonies of the major keratitis pathogens _S. aureus_ and _P. aeruginosa_ \\[ 2 \\]. The colonies we observed were also medium-sized circular smooth colonies that were dark pink to brown on both blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate ( Fig. 1 ). This should inform clinicians of the unusual colony morphology, which differs from that of the major keratitis pathogens observed in clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\n【22】This case has two exceptional aspects. First, the isolate was resistant to multiple drugs. There are no criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of _Shewanella_ species in international guidelines, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Therefore, we used the criteria for _P. aeruginosa_ , which is a related strain. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenem and intermediate to quinolone, which shows more resistant tendency than previous reported isolates. In a 2013 review of 239 cases since 1973, 82%, 94%, 94% and 98% of _Shewanella_ species were susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively \\[ 10 \\]. In our case, _S. algae_ was multi-drug resistant, rendering it difficult to treat, which can lead to treatment failure. Furthermore, the types of antibiotics that can be used in eye drops are limited, decreasing the treatment options.\n\n【23】Second, the patient had no history of seawater exposure. _Shewanella_ infections are often associated with marine exposure \\[ 5 , 7 \\]. Our patient had been hospitalized in a nursing hospital for more than 2 years, and his family had no relation to the sea. Consequently, we did not suspect _S. algae_ infection in this patient sooner. It is necessary to consider whether there are _S. algae_ infection routes other than marine exposure. We did not perform other culture such as stool culture, therefore it was not possible to confirm that _S. algae_ existed in the patient as colonization. Although _S. algae_ mainly inhabit the marine environment, there is a possibility of infection even if the patient did not have marine exposure. _S. algae_ is found naturally in wildlife including seawater as well as soil, fish, meat, and dairy product \\[ 6 \\]. There have been several cases of eye infections without marine exposure in previously published reports ( Table 1 ). Although no other investigation has been conducted to find the source of the infection, it should be thought that various environment including care giving staff and ingestion of seafood also can be the sources of infection.\n\n【24】As in this case, clinical isolates can be extremely rare species with high levels of drug resistance and can involve an atypical patient history. For best clinical practice, clinicians need to keep an eye on the laboratory results after ordering cultures.\n\n【25】This is the second report of bacterial keratitis caused by multi-drug resistant _S. algae_ worldwide and the first in Asia. Clinicians must track microbiology test results to determine appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【29】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】This research did not receive specific funding.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Consent was obtained in written format from the patient’s family for clinical information to be reported in the journal.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】J.C. and J.E.S.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

They are discovered incidentally in most cases. Data on their incidence, diagnosis, prognosis and management remain insufficient. The discovery is usually made at an advanced stage of lung cancer with the presence of metastases to other organs. We reported the case of a patient undergoing oncology follow-up for lung adenocarcinoma with discovery of adrenal gland metastases and a solitary pancreatic metastatic mass. His management remains palliative chemotherapy. Surgical treatment is not yet codified in these cases and remains at the discretion of the multidisciplinary oncology teams.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lung cancers are diagnosed at a metastatic stage in 40–50% of cases \\[ 1 \\]. Common metastases sites of lung cancers remain liver, adrenal, bone and kidney \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Pancreatic metastases of lung cancers are rare and incidental. It is usually seen at an advanced stage of the disease with other associated metastases. Data on its incidence, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment remain poor. Its incidence is 12% in post-mortem patients \\[ 1 \\]. Its prognosis remains guarded given the often advanced stage of the pathology. Several methods of treatment as surgery management, chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy were proposed \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【4】These metastases may raise a diagnosis issue between a primary pancreatic or secondary lung cancer localization. In most cases, this diagnosis is made at a stage of multiple metastases in patients known to have primary lung cancer \\[ 3 \\]. In the literature, most of the data have been provided by post-mortem examination of patients with primary lung cancer. However, studies are still needed to improve our knowledge of these pancreatic metastases and to improve the coding of their management. Imaging examinations, in particular the computed tomography (CT) scan, play an essential role in the discovery of these pancreatic metastases. It remains the routine imaging examination for monitoring patients in oncology.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We reported a case of 69-year-old male who was diagnosed since a year for lung adenocarcinoma. His treatment based on chemotherapy according to the line treatment of medical oncology of the hospital. He was in good health without any symptomatology. During his follow-up, thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan revealed a roughly rounded, poorly defined lung mass with irregular in shape, enhanced at the periphery after contrast media injection ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【7】Two bilateral adrenal masses were also discovered as hypodense, poorly defined, irregularly, and enhanced after injection of contrast medium ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【8】A hypodense pancreatic corporal mass, roughly rounded, with irregular contours, enhanced after injection of contrast medium, without dilation of the Wirsung. There is associated dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and the main bile duct ( Fig. 3 ). On ultrasound, this mass corresponds to a rounded, heterogeneous, echogenic lesion with discrete peripheral vascularization on color Doppler ( Fig. 4 ). A endoscopic biopsy for pancreatic mass was performed to confirm the diagnostic of non-primary tumor of pancreas. Histology confirmed a metastatic mass of lung cancer.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Chest CT scan injected (portal phase) in axial section in a parenchymal ( **A** ) and mediastinal ( **B** ) window showing a pulmonary mass with a necrotic center highlighted in the periphery in upper right lobe (red star).\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Abdominal CT scan injected (delayed phase: 10 min) in axial section ( **A** and **B** ) showing bilateral adrenal masses (red arrows).

There were no surgical indications according to the multidisciplinary consultation. The patient changed the treatment line due to multiple metastases, essentially involving chemotherapy without any radiotherapy.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】The most frequent metastases of lung cancer are liver, brain, adrenal and bone. Pancreatic metastases remain rare. There is not enough data on this issue. These pancreatic metastases of lung cancers would represent <5% in patients living with a pancreatic tumor \\[ 3 \\]. According to Adsay _et al._ , in autopsies performed on 4955 patients with metastases, the rate of pancreatic metastases was 1.6% and the primary sites in order of increase were renal cell carcinoma followed by lung cancer and colorectal cancer \\[ 4 \\]. In Japan, Maeno _et al._ found 26 cases of pulmonary metastases (3%) in 850 patients with lung cancer. In order of frequency, pancreatic metastases involved the following histological types: small cell carcinoma 10.5% and only 2.3% of adenocarcinomas \\[ 5 \\]. The diagnosis of these metastases remains difficult clinically, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery for other cancers, and is in most cases discovered on imaging, most often on CT scan. The other major difficulty is the distinction between primary and secondary pancreatic tumors. For Klein _et al._ , the CT features that may point to a pancreatic metastasis are the presence of other organ metastases, then often well-limited and more hypodense compared with a primary tumor and the intense enhancement indicative of the hypervascular nature of the metastasis \\[ 6 \\]. This distinction is even more difficult in solitary pancreatic masses. In their series, Maeno found that the usual pattern of pancreatic metastasis involved a solitary nodule in 73%, multiple nodules in 11.5% and diffuse swelling in 15.4% of the patients \\[ 5 \\]. Most metastatic lesions are located in the head of the pancreas, leading to obstruction of the bile ducts and jaundice. For some authors in the case of lung cancers, the majority are located in the head or the body of the pancreas with ~76% locating in the head in small cell lung carcinomas, followed by the body in 15% of cases \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】Generally, three aspects have been described most commonly a solitary pancreatic mass between 50 and 80%. The second aspect is that of diffuse infiltration of the pancreas through the glandular septa between 15 and 44% and the third aspect is that of multiple pancreatic nodules resulting in extensive destruction of the lobules of the pancreatic parenchyma \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【25】From a therapeutic point of view, there is no real consensus on the management of these pancreatic metastases. Indeed, the discovery of pancreatic metastasis is made at an advanced stage of primary cancer, lung cancer. Very few cases of surgery are performed. It would be better indicated in cases where the primary lung tumor is well controlled and with a solitary pancreatic mass. In a Japanese study of patients with pancreatic metastases of lung cancer, only eight cases of resection of pancreatic metastases were recorded from 1998 to 2006. All of these cases were with metastases from other organs (liver, adrenals and brain) after satisfactory control of these metastases by chemotherapy and/or preoperative radiotherapy \\[ 9 \\]. Adler _et al._ found a low rate of pancreatectomy for pancreatic metastasis of lung cancer with only eight cases of surgery out of 399 patients; this is due to the poor prognosis but also the late discovery of these metastases from lung cancers \\[ 10 \\]. The surgical management of metastases would be an excellent therapeutic, that means to improve the survival of patients outside adjuvant treatments, but no data on this management are yet known in this indication, and therefore needs further study. Roland _et al._ found a survival time after the discovery of pancreatic metastases from lung cancer of ~8.7 months (1–28 months) and only 4 of the 27 patients had received surgical treatment \\[ 11 \\]. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, therefore, have an essential role in the management of these patients with metastases, particularly because of the late stage of the disease with the presence of metastases to other organs.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEGEMENTS\n---------------\n\n【27】We thank the following individuals for their review of earlier drafts of the manuscript: Prof. Latib Rachida and Prof. Omor Youssef, Radiology Department of National Institute of Oncology, Ibn Sina hospital, Rabat, Morocco.\n\n【28】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【29】In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【34】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【35】Written informed consent for publication was obtained from patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】Dr Yehouenou Tessi Romeo Thierry is acting as a guarantor of this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Hereby, we report a case of a 12-year-old boy presenting with obstructive hydrocephalus due to brainstem dermoid cyst rupture.\n\n【2】Intracranial dermoid cysts are uncommon dysontogenetic lesions. They present <1% of all intracranial tumors \\[ 1 \\].

On MRI scans fat is depicted, dispersed and hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging, therefore dermoid cysts present as high signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Usually these lesions do not enhance after intravenous paramagnetic substance administration. On T2 weighted imaging, fat elements turn slightly, hypointense.\n\n【10】Complete surgical resection constitutes the proper treatment.

Although imaging may be helpful for diagnosis, fistulae are often difficult to identify. An 81-year-old woman presented with mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral pneumonia and hepatic cyst infection with air-fluid levels. After mechanical ventilation, abdominal CT showed increased air in the hepatic cyst. The drainage bag for the hepatic cyst infection was also inflated by positive pressure ventilation, suggesting a possible HBF. The ventilator was adjusted to minimize pressure on the fistula and prevent retrograde infection. The fistula eventually closed spontaneously.

HBF should be suspected when positive pressure ventilation results in increased air at the hepatic infection site.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A hepatobronchial fistula (HBF) is a rare complication of several hepatic diseases; no previous case reports have described HBF associated with hepatic cyst infection \\[ 1 \\]. An HBF is diagnosed by imaging and identification of clinical symptoms such as abdominal infection and respiratory failure \\[ 2 \\]; it is important to minimize pressure on the fistula through drainage or other means \\[ 3 \\]. In the case of ventilator management, positive pressure ventilation is required, making management even more difficult. We report the first case of hepatic cyst infection complicated by an HBF, diagnosed based on both characteristic computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings. Appropriate ventilator settings, as well as drainage management, eventually resulted in fistula closure.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 81-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, that had lasted for one and a half months. She has been diagnosed with an asymptomatic hepatic cyst previously ( Fig. 1 ). On examination, her body temperature was 36.1°C, blood pressure 116/77 mmHg, pulse 100/min and respiratory rate 25/min, with an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 86% on reserved mask at 10 L/min. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, and the abdomen was slightly distended. Laboratory examination results were as follows: white blood cell count, 16 100/μl; C-reactive protein, 14.52 mg/dl; AST, 24 U/L; ALT, 12 U/L; ALP, 465 U/L; γ-GTP, 91 U/L; T-Bil, 1.2 mg/dl and D-Bil, 0.4 mg/dl. Chest and abdominal CT showed bilateral consolidation in the lungs and a large cystic lesion with air in the right hepatic lobe ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Abdominal CT 5 years prior to admission showing a cyst in the right hepatic lobe.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Abdominal and chest CT at admission showing a cyst containing air-fluid levels in the right hepatic lobe measuring 106 mm × 103 mm, and bilateral consolidation in the lungs.\n\n【12】She was intubated and treated with positive pressure ventilation, vasopressors and antibiotics (tazobactam/piperacillin and clindamycin). The PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio after intubation was 142 (positive end-expiratory pressure 7 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O), and the patient was considered to have moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Contrast-enhanced CT (8 h after the first) showed an increase in air in the hepatic cyst ( Fig. 3A ) and a potential connection between the hepatic infection site and peripheral bronchus ( Fig. 3B ). We performed percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage (PTAD) and obtained 400 ml of creamy pus, and observed no leakage of contrast agent into the thoracic cavity ( Fig. 4 ). In addition to CT findings, the drainage bag was inflated by positive pressure ventilation; this led us to believe that the patient had an HBF. The ventilation settings were adjusted to apply minimal pressure in order to prevent the drainage bag from inflating, while preventing retrograde infection with positive pressure ventilation.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】( **A** ) Abdominal enhanced CT reveals a rapid increase of air within the hepatic cyst; ( **B** ) Abdominal enhanced CT showing disruption of the continuity of the wall of the hepatic cyst; the fluid component is continuing to the pleural cavity (red arrow).\n\n【16】**Figure 4**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】PTAD does not show any contrast agent leakage into the chest cavity.\n\n【19】Cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were positive for _Escherichia coli_ ; this also supported the diagnosis of a HBF. We changed the antibiotics to cefazolin and metronidazole on Day 4; the fistula was considered to be clinically closed on Day 5, as the drainage bag was no longer inflated. Blood and sputum cultures were negative on Day 9. CT showed a reduction in the size of the hepatic lesion ( Fig. 5 ), and her respiratory condition gradually improved. However, CT on Day 12 ( Fig. 6 ) revealed mediastinal emphysema. Due to concerns regarding the possibility of exacerbation of the mediastinal emphysema with positive pressure ventilation and improvement of the PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio, she was extubated on Day 13. However, her respiratory condition worsened, and she was unable to withstand further invasive procedures. After discussion with her family, we halted invasive treatment on Day 16, and she died on Day 18.\n\n【20】**Figure 5**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Abdominal CT shows a reduction in the size of the hepatic cyst infection.\n\n【23】**Figure 6**\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Chest CT showing mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema.\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【27】Hepatic cysts are asymptomatic and typically require no treatment. However, treatment is necessary when complications occur. Treatment strategies for infection include antibiotics, percutaneous drainage and surgical interventions. Initial independent antibiotic therapy fails in 70% of cases, eventually requiring percutaneous drainage or surgical treatment \\[ 4 \\]. The mortality rate is relatively low \\[ 4 \\]; however, complications due to HBF led to poor outcomes in our case. This case shows that patients with hepatic cysts are at risk of developing HBF due to infection.\n\n【28】There are five categories of HBF: congenital, hepatic hydatid disease or liver abscess, biliary tract obstruction secondary to tumors, injury and iatrogenic \\[ 1 \\]. Few cases are caused by infection, which accounts for 10% or less \\[ 5 \\]. A search of literature does not reveal any cases of hepatic cyst infection leading to HBF, although there are several case reports on HBF due to liver abscess, unrelated to hepatic cyst infection.\n\n【29】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are useful for the detection of fistulae. CT and magnetic resonance imaging are also useful diagnostic tools, although they can fail to detect the fistulous tract itself \\[ 2 \\]. In our case, we suspected HBF based on CT findings. A definite diagnosis was made based on the fact that the drainage bag inflated due to positive airway pressure, and the cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were the same, although PTAD did not reveal the fistula. There are no case reports on drainage bag expansion due to positive pressure ventilation; this finding will be useful for future practice.\n\n【30】There is currently no standard treatment for HBF. Maintaining low pressure at the opening of the fistula is vital \\[ 3 \\]. This can be accomplished by drainage, which may be accomplished by using a chest tube, ERCP, PTC or by surgical excision of the fistula tract. Clinicians prefer less invasive and non-surgical treatment, because the recovery rate is higher than that with traditional surgery \\[ 5 \\]. However, in refractory cases, traditional surgery is necessary \\[ 6 \\]. In our case, appropriate antibiotic treatment and drainage by PTAD were administered for the infected hepatic cyst; the patient responded well to the therapy. Ventilator settings were adjusted, and the fistula was considered to be clinically closed, because the drainage bag was no longer inflated by positive pressure ventilation. However, the patient had moderate ARDS at the time of initial treatment, and despite guideline-recommended respiratory management, she died due to progressive ARDS \\[ 7 \\]. If the presence of the fistula itself is detrimental to the condition, early surgical intervention may be necessary; however, surgery was not performed in this case owing to the severity of the disease and the vulnerable health of the patient.\n\n【31】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【32】Not applicable.\n\n【33】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【34】None declared.\n\n【35】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【36】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【37】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【38】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【39】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【40】Consent was obtained for publication of the data in this article.\n\n【41】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【42】Hatsuo Isogai.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Here, I present a case of a 64-year-old female cook who attended the General Medicine clinic with 2 months of persistent numbness and ‘burning’ sensation over the right anterolateral thigh. Subsequent physical examination revealed the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. The significance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica cannot be overemphasized. In most typical presentations, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not add value to confirm the diagnosis. If the clinical diagnosis is doubtful, nerve conduction study and magnetic resonance imaging may still be performed to exclude other mimicking pathologies. Increasing awareness of MP among doctors unfamiliar with this condition will prevent the ordering of excessive investigations.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a disorder characterized by abnormal sensations such as tingling, burning pain or numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh due to the dysfunction of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The LFCN is a sensory branch of the lumbar plexus derived from the posterior divisions of the L2 and L3 spinal nerves. After emerging from under the lateral border of the psoas major muscle, the nerve courses inferolateral around the iliac fossa into a tunnel formed by the lateral attachment of the inguinal ligament and the anterior superior iliac spine. At the level of the inguinal ligament, the LFCN is susceptible to trauma and entrapment. As the nerve exits from the pelvis, it bifurcates into anterior and posterior branches, which provide sensation to the anterior and lateral thigh, respectively (see Fig. 1 ).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old female cook at a childcare centre attended the General Medicine clinic with 2 months of persistent numbness and ‘burning’ sensation over the right anterolateral thigh. The symptoms were not aggravated by movement of the lower limb, and there were no relieving factors. She had no trauma to her back, right groin or thigh before the onset of symptoms. She had no backache, muscle ache or limb weakness. The bladder and bowel function were normal.\n\n【6】She had a history of minor back trauma > 30 years previously from which she made an uneventful recovery. She had well-controlled asthma on regular Seretide inhalers. She was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. Her general practitioner prescribed pregabalin 75-mg nocte and naproxen 275-mg twice daily to control the paraesthesia, but this offered her no relief.\n\n【7】Given the presenting complaint, a full neurological examination of the lower limbs was performed. She had no muscle wasting, and no deficits were elicited in tone, reflexes, power and coordination. The patient was able to demarcate a distinct area of paraesthesia on the anterolateral part of her right thigh. There were no overlying skin lesions on the paraesthetic area. Abdominal, inguinal and spine examinations were also unremarkable. She weighed 47.4 kg, and her body mass index was 23.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】The yellow line is the right LFCN. The green line is the inguinal ligament. The red shaded area is the area innervated by LFCN.\n\n【11】The clinical presentation and findings led to a diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. A nerve conduction study of both the right and left LFCNs showed similar values in the latency, amplitude and conduction velocity (see Table 1 ). Value differences of >50% from side to side is considered significant \\[ 1 \\]. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral plexus using the routine lumbar plexus protocol revealed mild focal swelling in the right LFCN proximal to the foramen beneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine, compatible with underlying meralgia paresthetica (see Fig. 2 ). The rest of its length on the MRI showed no abnormality. There were no bony or soft tissue abnormalities within the pelvic cavity. Further investigations revealed a normal full blood count, renal function, thyroid function, vitamin B12 level and HbA1c of 5.5% (Normal < 6.4%). When the patient was reviewed in the clinic 4 months after the onset of symptom, she reported the paraesthesia had resolved completely and spontaneously.\n\n【12】Table 1\n\n【13】Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n【14】| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【15】| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【16】Open in new tab\n\n【17】Table 1\n\n【18】Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n【19】| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【20】| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【21】Open in new tab\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Axial T2 FS image shoes mild focal swelling in the right LFCN underneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a condition commonly seen in primary care, orthopaedic surgery, bariatric surgery, obstetrics and intensive care settings. It is less frequently encountered in a General Medicine clinic.\n\n【27】There are many causes of MP. Some mechanical causes include obesity, pregnancy, pelvic masses, wearing tight belts or trousers and orthopaedic procedures causing direct damage to the LFCN. Metabolic factors such as lead poisoning, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism are also associated with MP. In a series of 67 patients with MP, 10 patients (15%) had no associated condition, making idiopathic cause the second most frequent finding after obesity \\[ 2 \\]. Although there was no apparent cause in our patient, the presence of focal swelling in the LFCN raises the possibility that recurrent microtrauma in her occupational role as a cook may have caused damage to the nerve pain fibres.\n\n【28】In this patient, the nerve conduction study (NCS) was reported as within normal limits. This finding is unsurprising because the NCS of the LFCN is often technically challenging to perform due to its anatomical position, the variations in its course, the presence of increased adipose tissue and the lack of a standard NCS protocol \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. In a retrospective, cross-sectional study from Korea, 26.9% of the patients with MP were found to have normal LFCN conduction study \\[ 4 \\]. This study suggests that NCS of the LFCN has a fairly low sensitivity in the diagnosis of MP and cannot be used as a substitute for a good history and appropriate physical examination. Nevertheless, an electrophysiological study may still be performed to rule out other mimicking diagnoses such as lumbar disk herniation and radiculopathy, especially if there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【29】Traditional MRI is not routinely used to assess LFCN as signal intensity changes of small peripheral nerves are usually challenging to evaluate. It may be performed to exclude other conditions that may mimic MP such as metastasis in the iliac crest, lumbar disk herniation, lumbar radiculopathy and chronic appendicitis \\[ 5–8 \\], and to identify other bony abnormalities that may cause compression along the course of the nerve \\[ 9 \\]. With advancing technology, magnetic resonance neurography is increasingly being utilized to diagnose or exclude a neuropathy, assess the degree of nerve injury, characterize the culprit lesion causing nerve entrapment and aid radiological-guided injection of perineural medication \\[ 10 \\]. In the presence of neuropathy, the signal intensity of the injured nerve increases and is similar to the fluid-like signal intensity of the neighbouring vessels on T2 weighted imaging, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【30】In conclusion, this case has highlighted the importance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. In most cases, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not help make the diagnosis. Raising awareness of meralgia paresthetica among physicians unfamiliar with the condition will prevent the overuse of investigations.\n\n【31】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【32】I thank Professor C.

We treated a patient with a partial-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon by a series of four type I porcine collagen ultrasound-guided injections, at weekly intervals. At the same time the patient underwent physical therapy, consisting of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises. The patient was assessed before the treatment and up to 18 months after the last injection by the Constant–Murley score, the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and ultrasonography. Shoulder pain and functional limitation progressively improved and they almost completely disappeared at the last follow-up. Ultrasonography showed a gradual healing of the partial-thickness tear and a regeneration of the tendon structure. This is the first study on ultrasound-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Future research should confirm the excellent result achieved in this case report.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Partial-thickness rotator cuff tear (PTRCT) is one of the most common shoulder injuries \\[ 1 \\]. The supraspinatus (SSP) tendon is the most affected in PTRCTs \\[ 1 \\]. The treatment of PTRCTs remains disputed; non-operative treatment is the first approach \\[ 2 \\]. Many injectable therapies have been proposed in the last years with controversial effectiveness \\[ 3 \\]. According to literature, this is the first study on ultrasound (US)-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of PTRCTs.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In March 2018, a 55-year-old right-handed housewife came to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Practice complaining of pain and functional limitation in the left shoulder, lasting 2 months. She didn’t report neither systemic or genetic disorders, nor previous traumas or surgical interventions and nor allergies or intolerances. She suffered from hypothyroidism and she was in treatment with sodium levothyroxine. She didn’t smoke. She was habitually practising free-body gymnastics twice a week. She had already treated the shoulder pain with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, without improvements.\n\n【6】Based on physical examination we suspected left SSP tendon involvement. We excluded glenohumeral osteoarthritis by X-rays. Shoulder ultrasonography, performed by a radiologist with >20 years of experience in skeletal muscle US, revealed a partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the SSP tendon (Grade II according to Ellman classification). We decided to treat the patient with a series of four US-guided intratendineous injections of 2-ml porcine type I collagen at weekly intervals in combination with physical therapy. After a full and clear description of the study, the patient was invited to sign the informed consent.\n\n【7】Injections were performed by a single doctor with >10 years of experience using an anterior approach. The patient was seated on a chair with the arm in internal rotation in order to expose as much of the SSP tendon as possible. This position was best achieved by placing the patient’s arm behind her back. A 22-gauge needle was directed towards the tear of the SSP tendon as guided by US until the tip of the needle was seen in the correct position and then the collagen was injected slowly.\n\n【8】Physiokinesitherapy was performed starting from the first injection and during 4 weeks, three times a week, 30 minutes per session and consisted of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises, with the aim to recover range of motion and strength of the shoulder.\n\n【9】The patient was evaluated at the time of enrolment (T0), right before the third injection (T1), and 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after the last injection by means of the Constant–Murley (CM) score and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Clinical data are reported in Table 1 and their trends illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\n【10】Table 1\n\n【11】CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n【12】| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【13】| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【14】Open in new tab\n\n【15】Table 1\n\n【16】CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n【17】| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【18】| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【19】Open in new tab\n\n【20】**Figure 1**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Outcome measures of the CM score and the DASH questionnaire over the time.\n\n【23】US assessment was performed at T0, T3 and T4 by the same expert radiologist. As shown in Fig. 2 , longitudinal US of the SSP tendon at T0 showed a well-defined hypoechoic area, indicating partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the tendon, without retraction (Grade II according to Ellman classification). Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (Grade I according to Ellman classification). Eventually, the T4 US assessment no longer showed tear within the tendon, which in addition appeared quite regular and isoechoic.\n\n【24】**Figure 2**\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】US assessment of the SSP tendon across multiple follow-up intervals. ( **a** ) Longitudinal US of the SSP tendon at T0 showed a well-defined partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the tendon, without retraction (arrow). ( **b** ) Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (arrow). ( **c** ) At 18-month follow-up, the tendon looked quite regular and isoechoic, without any sign of tear (arrow).\n\n【27】The patient was totally compliant, following all the appointments given. No adverse events have been described after collagen injections.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】According to literature, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of shoulder US on rotator cuff tear detection has a range of 46–95% and 50–95%, respectively \\[ 4 \\]. The variability is highly correlated with the level of experience of the operator and the patterns of the rotator cuff tears \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【30】Non-operative treatment is the first approach to PTRCTs, and surgical option has to be considered when the conservative treatment has not effect within the first 6–12 weeks \\[ 2 \\]. Physical therapy is the first-line treatment \\[ 5 \\]. Rest from exacerbating activity, especially repetitive overhead activity and heavy lifting, can improve the pain component. Cortisone injections may be helpful in alleviating pain in conjunction with physical therapy but offer only short-term effects \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【31】Different injectable therapies have been proposed in the past years for the treatment of PRTCTs (e.g. hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, prolotherapy), but they have achieved controversial effectiveness according to literature \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【32】We have decided to treat the PTRCT of our patient with type I collagen injections on the base of (i) the positive effect proved by injectable collagen on the tendon structure of cultured tenocytes \\[ 6 \\]; (ii) the good results achieved by collagen patches implanted arthroscopically in the treatment of large and massive RC tears \\[ 7 \\] and (iii) the promising outcomes of collagen injections in the treatment of epicondylitis and SSP tendinopathy without tears \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Studies of degenerative tendons have found a small but significant decrease in the total collagen content and an increased proportion of collagen type III relative to collagen type I. The increase in the collagen type III to collagen type I ratio was consistent with smaller, less organized and weaker tendons.\n\n【33】This case report has one main limitation: the patient was not previously treated with other injective therapies; so, we cannot state that the positive effect on the PTRCT is certainly due to type I porcine collagen only. It is well known indeed that tendon needling is able to disrupt the chronic degenerative process of tendinopathies favouring localized bleeding and fibroblastic proliferation \\[ 10 \\]. However, no data exist on the benefits of tendon needling as a stand-alone treatment for tendon tears.\n\n【34】In conclusion, the tear healing, the improvement in the tendon structure, the clinical and functional positive outcomes and the absence of side effects allow us to propose collagen injections as a valid option for the treatment of PTRCTs. A regenerative effect of collagen injections on tendon structure may be assumed to account the results achieved. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n【35】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【36】None declared.\n\n【37】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【38】No approval was required.\n\n【39】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【40】An informed patient consent has been completed and it is held by the treating institution.\n\n【41】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【42】Bruno Corrado.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Following ileostomy reversal, he complained of intense, unremitting anorectal pain. After repeated scans, computed tomography (CT) showed findings suggestive of a longstanding anastomotic leak. Subsequent, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteomyelitis of the sacrum, with the development of sacral osteomyelitis in this context unusual. Our case highlights the importance of appropriate radiological imaging and that clinicians should consider osteomyelitis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe anorectal pain after treatment for rectal cancer.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】A 66-year-old man with a diagnosis of moderately differentiated T3 N1 M0 adenocarcinoma of the rectum in 2015 underwent short course radiotherapy prior to anterior resection that was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, which were stopped prematurely due to grade 1 peripheral neuropathy. His temporary ileostomy was reversed 1 year later. Following reversal, he was troubled with on-going difficulties of bowel function including increased frequency, urgency with incontinence and tenesmus. Most troublesome of all was progressive rectal pain. He was referred to our Consequences of Colorectal Cancer Clinic, 4 years later.\n\n【4】Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed no significant changes other than a previous anterior resection. His blood tests during this time showed normal leukocyte counts and a mildly elevated C-reactive protein that ranged from 16 to 29. Three CT scans of his abdomen and pelvis were arranged before referral to us. The initial CT in July 2017 showed presacral soft tissue thickening with air pockets that were in keeping with typical postsurgical changes. However, unusually, this presacral collection became more prominent in subsequent CT scans. By the time of his third CT in late 2018, a fistula between the rectum and the presacral collection at the anastomotic site could be identified ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting a longstanding anastomotic leak. Multiple sinus tracts were also seen on this CT scan.\n\n【5】Figure 1\n\n【6】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【7】Axial section of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) shows the communication of rectum to presacral collection at anastomotic site.\n\n【8】Due to his on-going symptoms and for better delineation of the anatomic structures, MRI of the sacrum and coccyx with Short-TI Inversion Recovery sequences was requested. This showed hyperintense signalling in the lower sacral vertebrae representing changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis ( Fig. 2 ). The presacral collection was also again seen and consistent with a persistent small leak from his previous anterior resection. The patient was therefore discussed at the surgical MDT. The decision was made to treat him empirically with 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. There was no attempt made to obtain an aspirate from the collection. Once the antibiotic treatment was completed, the patient went on to have a Hartmann’s procedure performed. This led to very rapid reduction in and then abolition of his pain. On subsequent reviews, his stoma was functioning well and he had no rectal symptoms.\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Short-TI Inversion Recovery coronal sequence showing hyperintense signal in lower sacral vertebrae representing changes due to chronic osteomyelitis.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Long-term significant defaecatory dysfunction following anterior resection is estimated to occur in between 37 and 90% of patients \\[ 1 \\]. When anorectal pain is present, it may indicate local recurrence, anal fissuring \\[ 2 \\] or rarely deep ulceration of ischaemic origin, either from the radiotherapy or injudicious endoscopic or local surgical intervention in irradiated mucosa. Radiotherapy-induced insufficiency fractures may also be a cause \\[ 3 \\]. Occasionally, anorectal pain after pelvic radiation therapy is attributed to neuropathy; however, in our experience, this is very rare with modern radiotherapy techniques. Symptoms develop insidiously and are often dismissed when recurrence has been excluded.\n\n【14】Sacral osteomyelitis is an extremely rare complication of treatment for pelvic cancer. When it occurs, it is usually associated with fistulization from the rectum as in our patient or in one other case we have found \\[ 4 \\] or from the urinary tract \\[ 5 \\]. If left untreated, it can often be life-threatening due to the sequelae of sepsis, neurological involvement and fulminant faecal meningitis \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【15】MRI imaging should be utilized to assess patients with ongoing anorectal pain following treatment for pelvic cancer. In those who have developed sacral osteomyelitis, MRI demonstrates changes in the water content of bone marrow while also providing excellent structural definition \\[ 6 \\]. It also helps to plan for optimal surgical management and to assess the extent of devitalized tissue \\[ 7 \\]. If MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, nuclear medicine studies and CT are useful alternatives. Nuclear medicine studies involve intravenous administration of a radionuclide, which emits radiation that is detected by a gamma camera. This allows assessment of abnormal bone metabolism, which in osteomyelitis manifests as areas of increased radionuclide uptake. In general, nuclear medicine studies have very high sensitivity in the detection of osteomyelitis and allow imaging of the whole skeleton to look for multiple sites of infection \\[ 8 \\]. However, they are limited by poor specificity and anatomical localization. CT, on the other hand, can demonstrate clearly the anatomical relationship between areas of infection and important structures, such as adjacent bowel and major vessels. CT also has superior bony resolution to MRI and is better at demonstrating osseous changes such as cortical destruction, periosteal reactions and sequestrum formation. However, CT is unable to demonstrate bone marrow oedema, which means that a normal CT does not exclude early osteomyelitis \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【16】Treatment of sacral osteomyelitis is often multi-modal and can involve a combination of targeted antibiotic therapy, radiological drainage and/or surgery \\[ 4 \\]. It is therefore important to approach cases in a multi-disciplinary manner, with the involvement of an experienced radiologist and surgeon. The decision to surgically intervene must be individualized to the clinical condition of the patient, with more aggressive and extensive surgery recommended for those patients with significant sepsis and extensive bony or neurological involvement \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【17】In conclusion, clinicians should have a low index of suspicion of an anastomotic leak and associated sacral osteomyelitis when treated rectal cancer patients present late, often after many years, with anorectal pain. Our case has highlighted the importance of this and how imaging can be utilized to diagnose the condition and plan for treatment.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【19】None.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】N/A\n\n【26】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【27】Written and signed consent has been given by the patient involved in this case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The patient’s pheochromocytoma was incidentally identified in a computed tomography scan during the initial workup. Although a rare condition, pheochromocytoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially in young patients presenting with unexplained hypertension, chest pain and cardiac dysfunction.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine producing tumor that can go undetected over a long period of time, until it presents with a myriad of symptoms, often imitating other diseases and disorders. We present a case report regarding a young man with episodes of severe hypertension over a period of at least 9 years. Ultimately, with a possible trigger from the intake of multiple energy drinks, he presents with severe hypertension and symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 33-year-old man, without known co-morbidities, was brought into the emergency department with sudden onset of headache and severe central chest pain, radiating to the back. The patient arrived 3.5 hours after the onset of symptoms and was still in severe pain.\n\n【6】The blood pressure was 180/125 mmHg, heart rate 105 beats per minute (bpm), temperature 36.1°C, oxygen-saturation 98% and the respiratory-rate was 28 per minute. An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed significant lactate acidosis with pH 7.14, pO2 of 15.4 kPa, pCO2 of 4.5 kPa, bicarbonate of 12 mEq/L, base excess of −16 mmol/L and lactate value of 12 mmol/L. A 12 lead electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with slight ST-depressions in the leads V4–6.\n\n【7】Bedside echocardiography revealed regional hypokinesia in the lateral area of the left ventricle, and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20–30%.\n\n【8】The patients’ blood samples demonstrated abnormal with a troponin T of 300 ng/L, white blood cell count of 39 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and normal c-reactive protein.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Hemodynamics and biomarkers as measured under admission.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】CT scan under admission.

However, a 6 cm large tumor in the left adrenal gland was found in Fig. 1 .\n\n【16】During the first hours of observation, the patient’s symptoms spontaneously resolved. His vitals normalized and a repeated ABG showed a rising pH (7.33) and decreasing lactate (5.6 mmol/L).\n\n【17】Meanwhile, the patient’s previous history was explored in more detail. The evening before his admission, he had consumed multiple energy drinks, but denies the intake of alcohol or any other substances.\n\n【18】Nine years earlier, he presented with similar symptoms at another hospital, likewise had spontaneously recovered and was quickly discharged without a firm diagnosis. Similarly, 4 years prior to this admission, the patient was acutely hospitalized with headache, back pain, nausea, elevated lactate, white blood cell count and blood pressure. That admission summary described that all symptoms remitted, his vitals as well as blood values normalized over a few hours and the patient was discharged after a day of observation, without finding a plausible explanation to his symptoms.\n\n【19】Due to these findings and the suspicion of pheochromocytoma-induced cardiomyopathy, the patient was admitted.\n\n【20】During the 7-day admission, the patient’s vitals remained normal and blood samples including troponin T slowly normalized. A repeated transthoracic echocardiography showed a LVEF of 45% in Fig. 2 .\n\n【21】Plasma cortisol, renin, aldosterone and a 24-hour urine sample for steroid metabolites were within normal range. 3-Metthoxyadrenalin was elevated to 2,5 nmol/L (normal range: < 0,46 nmol/L) as well as 3-Metthoxynoradrenalin at 29,6 nmol/L (normal range < 1,09 nmol/L).\n\n【22】During this observation, the patient reported no symptoms and was discharged for planned surgery in an outpatient setting.\n\n【23】Due to the size of the tumor (6 cm in diameter) and hence a slightly increased risk of malignancy, open left-sided adrenalectomy was performed \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【24】The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after uncomplicated surgery and observation period. Follow-up showed normalization of 3-metthoxyadrenalin and 3-metthoxynoradrenalin, and the patient had not experienced any symptoms or complications.\n\n【25】The left adrenal gland was found with a well-defined pheochromocytoma with a maximum diameter of 25 mm. The tumor morphology was with the growth of large nests and solid areas, high cellularity and areas with spindle cells as well as areas with profound nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. Thus, the Pheochromocytoma of Adrenal Gland Scales (PASS) score was 8 in Fig. 3 \\[ 2 \\]. It is not possible to predict the malign potential of a pheochromocytoma from the histopathology, but a PASS score > 4 indicates potential for aggressive clinical behavior. Thus, the patient will be followed with annually blood tests (3-metthoxyadrenalin, 3-metthoxynoradrenalin) lifelong. \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【26】Figure 3\n\n【27】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【28】Histology of the patients’ tumor specimen.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【30】Pheochromocytoma is the underlying cause in ~0.2–0.5% of patients presenting with hypertension \\[ 3 \\]. The tumor is more commonly seen in people with a positive family history of pheochromocytoma, as well as other genetic syndromes such as MEN-2 and neurofibromatosis \\[ 3 \\]. Therefore genetic testing, especially in young patients with pheochromocytoma, should be considered.\n\n【31】Typically, patients presenting with acute adrenergic spells will have at least one or more of the ‘Five P’ symptoms: paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, perspiration, pallor or pounding headache \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. However, in the acute setting pheochromocytoma can present with a variety of symptoms mimicking other serious conditions, most commonly acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【32】Cardiomyopathy secondary to pheochromocytoma is a rare complication \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Although the conditions pathophysiology can be attributed to the acute secretion of catecholamines, it is debatable whether this fully classifies as cardiomyopathy or should more accurately be defined as catecholamine-induced vasospasm. Since the available literature as well as the majority of case reports describes the condition as catecholamine-induced or takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy, the authors of this article have decided to follow this classification \\[ 6–9 \\].\n\n【33】Novel in this case, the patient had presented experienced severe symptomatic episodes several years apart, which all spontaneously resolved within short time. In the years between the episodes, he had been completely asymptomatic. As further mentioned, the night prior to the patients admission, he had been drinking multiple energy drinks over the course of the evening. An admission report from 4 years prior mentions that the patient was working out at a fitness-center, where he experienced sudden onset of his symptoms. Considering this history it seems a possible explanation that the patient’s attacks were triggered by these preceding stressors.\n\n【34】Although a rare condition, pheochromocytoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially in young patients presenting with unexplained hypertension, chest pain and cardiac dysfunction. If a cyclic pattern of symptoms or increased genetic risk can be identified, the relevant examinations should be performed to avoid delayed therapy and further complications of untreated disease.\n\n【35】DECLARATION\n-----------\n\n【36】All authors have seen and approved the paper.\n\n【37】The article is the original work of all the authors listed.\n\n【38】The article has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration elsewhere.\n\n【39】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【40】None.\n\n【41】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【42】No funding was received.\n\n【43】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【44】None declared.\n\n【45】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【46】The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【47】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【48】Written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【49】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【50】Christopher Zörner.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe a 73-year-old woman who presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and melena. A computed tomography scan revealed a hypodense lesion, measuring 6 × 6 × 5 cm, along the upper part of the stomach. An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion, measuring 8 × 6 cm, between the cardia and body of the stomach. Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion, consistent with a lipoma, in the body of the stomach. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. A laparoscopy was offered, and a wedge resection was performed. A histopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lipomatous tumor in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and her hemoglobin level subsequently returned to normal. Overall, clinicians may be unfamiliar with GA because patients may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. Physicians should be aware of the characteristic histopathological features to distinguish GA from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Angiolipomas are subcutaneous benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels \\[ 1 \\]. Most angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract have been reported in the liver, and only a few cases of gastric angiolipomas (GA) have been reported \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. A gastric angiolipoma almost exclusively occurs as a solitary lesion, and patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms. Some patients may be asymptomatic, whereas others may have signs and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia \\[ 2–4 \\]. We report a case of gastric angiolipoma in a patient who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools. The patient denied any history of hematemesis, per rectal bleeding, fever or weight loss. She also denied any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, heart burn or reflux disease. Her family history was non-contributive. A review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【6】On examination, she was conscious, oriented, alert and did not show signs of respiratory distress. She looked pale but her vital signs were stable. Cardiovascular and chest examinations were unremarkable. Her abdomen was mildly distended and soft on palpation. It was not tender to palpation and bowel sounds were normal. Her initial workup revealed anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 6.4 g/dl. An abdominal X-ray reveled a normal distribution of bowel gas.\n\n【7】The patient was initially resuscitated successfully. She received 2 l of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells, which resulted in an improvement of her hemoglobin level to 7.5 g/dl. She was also started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy before performing further investigations.\n\n【8】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, chest and pelvis revealed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper part of the stomach ( Fig. 1 ). The lesion showed mostly fatty density and multiple lymph node enlargements surrounding the stomach and gastrohepatic ligament, with the largest one measuring 1 cm. The chest and pelvis were unremarkable.\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】A CT scan of the abdomen showed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper stomach.\n\n【12】An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion measuring 8 × 6 cm between the cardia and body of the stomach ( Fig. 2 ). Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with circumscribed margins in the body of the stomach, consistent with a lipoma. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. Endoscopic resection was not suitable in this case lesion too large, that's why laparoscopic resection was chosen here.\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Upper endoscopy images showing a large polypoid mass.\n\n【16】A laparoscopy identified a mass in the midsection of the greater curvature of the stomach. LigaSure™ was used to release the omentum from the greater curvature. Next a wedge resection was done by using Endo GIA size 60 (purple). A gross evaluation revealed a homogeneous, yellow-tan colored, fatty mass measuring 6 × 5 × 4 cm, with no area of hemorrhage or necrosis. A histopathological examination revealed a well-demarcated encapsulated lipomatous tumor arising in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n【17】Figure 3\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Histopathological section of the specimen (hematoxylin and eosin staining) showing varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels ( **A** ). Magnified image of the specimen ( **B** ).\n\n【20】The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was followed up twice after surgery. Her symptoms completely resolved, and her hemoglobin level was stable at 12 g/dl.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are a rare entity composed of mature fat cells and proliferating cells that are usually found in the gastric antrum. The symptoms associated with GA are nonspecific and may range from dyspepsia, vague abdominal discomfort, pain, cramping, bloating and gastrointestinal bleeding \\[ 3–6 \\]. Anemia is also common in these patients and is usually the result of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding \\[ 7 \\]. The patient in our case presented with fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools, which is characteristic in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although our patient presented with a 3-day history of melena and had severe anemia requiring resuscitation, she may have had occult blood in her stool that went undetected until the tumor caused mucosal ulceration and massive bleeding.\n\n【23】On ultrasonography, an angiolipoma appears as a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous, hyperechoic mass \\[ 8 \\]. The findings on an abdominal CT are usually variable, with the tumor generally appearing as a heterogenous mass with mixed soft tissue density and fat. The lesion in this patient’s case appeared as a solitary, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with smooth borders on a linear endoscopic ultrasound. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hypodense lesion that showed mostly fatty density. Generally, the density of an angiolipoma can vary on CT based on the proportion of the tumor’s components, making it challenging to reach a diagnosis pre-operatively. Thus, the diagnosis is usually made intraoperatively and confirmed following a histopathological examination \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【24】On gross examination, an angiolipoma is a well-defined, encapsulated mass and its cut surface has a yellowish to reddish appearance based on its fat or vascular component. The tumor is composed of mature adipose cells interspersed with proliferating blood vessels \\[ 9 \\]. In some cases, fibrin thrombi are observed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections is central to determining the varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels in the tumor. However, immunohistochemical examination is rarely required.\n\n【25】The treatment of angiolipoma depends on the tumor size. In patients with small pedunculated polyps, an endoscopic resection can be offered. However, the diagnosis is usually discovered late when patients already present with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction, making it challenging to perform an endoscopic resection. Given the increased risk of hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation, endoscopic resection may not be recommended for large tumors or those with wide implantation bases. In these cases, it may be more beneficial to surgically excise the tumor \\[ 4 \\]. An excellent prognosis has been reported following surgical resection \\[ 4 , 9 \\], as was the case in our patient, whose symptoms resolved completely after laparoscopy.\n\n【26】Overall, patients with GA may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. This underscores the need for physicians to be aware of the characteristic histopathological features of this tumor to distinguish it from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【28】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】None declared.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】The Research Ethics Committee of Security Forces Hospital approved the report.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】A written consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【35】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【36】Saeed Abdulrahman Alghamdi is the guarantor of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Capillary Blood Glucose was 29 mmol/L. HbA1c was 133 mmol/L. Non-contrast computerised tomography (CT) scan of the brain was normal suggesting that the cause of her seizure was hyperglycaemia. However, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed infarcts in the left paracentral lobule and caudate nucleus. It also identified loss of signal flow void in the intracranial segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) raising the suspicion for thrombosis secondary to dissection. This was later confirmed on CT angiogram. This case demonstrates how the initial CT Head was non-diagnostic. We stress the importance of taking a careful seizure history and subsequently obtaining an MRI scan to fully exclude structural pathology.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The annual incidence of carotid artery dissection is approximately 2.5–3 per 100 000 patients \\[ 1 \\]. Causes are either traumatic or atraumatic. Presentation can include seizures, headaches or even focal neurological deficits which can become permanent due to prolonged ischaemia causing cerebral infarcts. We report the case of a 36-year-old Type 2 diabetic woman, initially thought to have had a hyperglycaemic seizure, who instead had cerebral infarcts secondary to a left ICA dissection which was likely the true cause of her seizure. We stress the importance of taking a careful history of the seizure and we caution against the reliance on a CT scan to exclude structural pathology.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a witnessed seizure which resulted in loss of consciousness. In particular, she described shaking of the right hand which progressed sequentially to involve the right arm and then the right leg. She then lost consciousness for approximately 2–3 minutes after which she regained consciousness but remained drowsy. In the preceding 48 hours, she reported that she had two episodes of shaking in her right hand. These lasted approximately 2–3 minutes and resolved spontaneously. She had no previous seizure history. On examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15 and she had no neurological deficits as a result of the seizure. She had a 21 year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus which was managed with oral hypoglycaemic drugs. She had no other significant medical history. Her capillary blood glucose level was 29 mmol/L and her HbA1c level was 133 mmol/L. Her HbA1c had ranged between 114 and 144 mmol/L over the last 6 years indicating poor glycaemic control. Her remaining blood tests were normal. Apart from the patient’s ethnicity (South East Asian) and diabetic status there were no other cardiovascular risk factors for a stroke. A non-contrast CT scan of her brain was normal. A lumbar puncture ruled out intracranial infection as it showed mildly raised cerebrospinal fluid glucose and protein levels. At this point, it was felt that hyperglycaemia was the most likely cause for her seizure. Accordingly, her glycaemic control was optimised and preparations for discharge were made.\n\n【6】Nonetheless, an MRI scan of the brain was organised to definitively exclude structural pathology. This MRI showed that the patient had a subacute infarction of her left paracentral lobule as well as an infarction of the head of her left caudate nucleus. In addition, the MRI also showed that she had loss of the normal vascular flow void of the intracranial segment of the left ICA raising the suspicion of thrombosis of the vessel secondary to a dissection. Consequently, a CT angiogram was arranged and it confirmed near complete dissection of the left ICA. This pathology is depicted in Figs 1 – 5 .\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Images A and B are coronal views of the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence of the brain.

Normal ICA on the right (curved arrow).\n\n【22】Subsequent CT perfusion studies demonstrated no significant perfusion defect caused by the ICA dissection ( Fig. 6 ). The derived CT angiogram demonstrated reduced filling in the left ICA. There was preservation of flow in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and left anterior cerebral artery (ACA), possibly due to adequate interhemispheric flow via the anterior communicating artery ( Fig. 7 ). She underwent further blood tests for anti-nuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-immunoglobulin G antibody anti-cardiolipin antibodies, all of which were negative. As part of a wider serological work-up, she also had negative results for lyme serology, hepatitis serology, human immunodeficiency virus, treponema pallidum and paraneoplastic antibodies. She was then started on anti-epileptic and anticoagulation therapy as management. She was reviewed via telephone 9 months later, at which point, she reported no further seizures or any other residual symptoms. She mentioned that she was back to her usual quality of life at this time.\n\n【23】Figure 6\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Images A and B show the CT perfusion map appearances of cerebral blood volume and mean transit time, respectively.

Moreover, ICA dissection is known to account for approximately 20% of stokes that occur in patients under 45 years of age \\[ 3–5 \\]. Collectively, these results stress the importance of ruling out other causes of focal-onset seizures such as ICA dissection when assessing a patient presenting with a new focal onset seizure even the context of convincing factors such as hyperglycaemia. The involuntary shaking of the right hand followed by sequential progression of seizure activity to the entire right body suggested that the focus of her seizure was the left primary motor cortex. This is well correlated with infarction in her left paracentral lobule given its anatomical proximity to left primary motor cortex. We felt that the left caudate nucleus infarction was likely secondary to seizure activity for two reasons. Firstly, it was of a lower hyperintensity as compared with the infarction in the left paracentral lobule. Secondly, the anatomical location of the left caudate nucleus infarction did not correlate as well with the clinical description of the seizure.\n\n【31】This case also demonstrates how it is insufficient to rely on CT to exclude structural pathology. Recent studies have revealed that CT failed to detect abnormalities which were detected on MRI in 26–57% of cases of a newly presenting seizure \\[ 6 \\]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guideline \\[CG137\\] section 1.6.21 states that MRI \\`is particularly important' in any patient with a seizure who has \\`any suggestion of a focal onset on history, examination or \\[electroencephalogram\\] (unless clear evidence of benign focal epilepsy)’ \\[ 7 \\]. This case serves as a rationale behind the existence of such guidelines and provides some context in which these guidelines should be interpreted. In conclusion, we stress the importance of taking a careful history when evaluating a patient presenting with a new focal-onset seizure and we advise clinicians to always rule out other causes of seizures even in the context of convincing factors.\n\n【32】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【33】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【34】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【35】No sources of funding.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】Not applicable.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】The patient has provided written consent for publication of this manuscript.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】Anmol Pandey.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Metastases to the thyroid gland are rare, representing less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies. Here, we report a case of a 69-year-old Asian man who had both thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders but no nodules/tumours in the lung field. The patient died 51 days after his first visit to our office, although pembrolizumab was administered on day 34 based on programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with paired box 8 (PAX8) may be useful to diagnostically distinguish poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas from napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cancers of unknown primary (CUPs) are metastatic tumours whose primary site cannot be identified during pretreatment evaluation \\[ 1 \\]. Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary account for approximately 70% of CUPs \\[ 2 \\]. The median survival of patients with adenocarcinomas is 3 months, with a 17% 1-year survival rate \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【4】When tumour(s) are identified within the thyroid gland, metastases to the thyroid gland or secondary involvement by direct extension from a nonthyroid malignancy in the neck must be considered. However, metastases to the thyroid gland represent less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Common primary sites for thyroid metastases include the kidneys, head, neck (squamous cell carcinomas), lung and breast \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【5】Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of neck stiffness at his first visit to our office and died after an aggressive disease course. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed no nodules/tumours in the lung field but thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies from the thyroid tumour and from a subcutaneous tumour in the left shoulder revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) suggested that the tumour was likely a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 69-year-old Asian man was referred to our office for neck stiffness and persistent coughing for over a month. His past medical history was significant for gastric and duodenal ulcers that improved after _H. pylori_ eradication. He had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 50 years. His physical examination revealed subcutaneous, board-like indurations and nodules/tumours without bilateral supraclavicular and cervical tenderness.\n\n【8】Contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland (i.e. a thyroid tumour), which displaced the trachea to the left side and subcutaneous nodules/tumours that displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle anteriorly (Fig. 1 ). High-resolution CT scanning revealed no nodules/tumours in the lung field as shown in Video 1 of the supplementary material . To clarify the cytopathological features of the subcutaneous nodules/tumours, the patient was referred to our otolaryngologist, who performed fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies on the subcutaneous tumour in the left supraclavicular region as well as on the thyroid tumour (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【9】Figure 1:\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Contrast-enhanced CT scan showing the thyroid tumour (yellow arrow) and subcutaneous nodules/tumours in the left supraclavicular region (red arrows). The thyroid gland and lymph nodes were enlarged in the neck and shoulders.\n\n【12】Nine days after his first visit to our office, the patient was transferred to our emergency department by ambulance due to severe chest tightness. Cardiac echography and a plain CT scan showed cardiac tamponade (data not shown; Fig. 2 ); therefore, continuous pericardial drainage was performed.\n\n【13】Figure 2:\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Plain CT scan showing the cardiac tamponade caused by pericardial effusion (yellow arrow) and pleural effusion (red arrows). The pericardial effusion displaced the cardiac muscle.\n\n【16】Cytological analysis of the FNA biopsies of the subcutaneous and thyroid tumours as well as of the pericardial effusion, indicated a CUP, possibly an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (data not shown).\n\n【17】On day 12, an excisional biopsy was performed for extensive IHC analyses on the subcutaneous tumours in the left supraclavicular region (Figs 3 and 4 ). Table 1 summarizes the IHC results for pan-keratin antibodies AE1 and AE3 (AE1/3), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, vimentin, calretinin, p40, paired box 8 (PAX8), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). (PAX8 staining was performed after the patient was deceased.) The patient’s serum CEA levels were 13.4 ng/ml (day 1), 520.5 ng/ml (day 10) and 596.6 ng/ml (day 50).\n\n【18】Figure 3:\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of a subcutaneous tumour in the left supraclavicular region.

TTF-1 and napsin A positivity are reported to reliably enable distinguishing primary from metastatic tumours of the lung \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Napsin A expression was less intense and partially positive in the patient, while TTF-1 was positive (Fig. 4 ). Napsin A has a higher specificity of 96% but a lower sensitivity of 65% for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma compared with TTF-1 expression (81% for each measure) \\[ 6 \\]. Furthermore, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas may be napsin A-positive \\[ 8 \\]. TTF-1 is also positive in thyroid tumours, regardless of histologic type, and in lung carcinomas, including 75% of adenocarcinomas \\[ 7 \\]. Therefore, PAX8 may have a crucial role in diagnostically distinguishing napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas from lung adenocarcinomas, which are PAX8 negative, as in our patient \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. PAX8 stain positivity is also diagnostically useful for müllerian, renal, and thymic carcinomas and pancreatic endocrine tumours \\[ 7 \\]. Further, thyroglobulin staining might be useful for distinguishing thyroid from lung primaries if differentiation to mature thyroid glands is partially preserved \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【48】Pembrolizumab was reported to result in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells \\[ 9 \\]. The patient, however, died 17 days after receiving pembrolizumab. Since the time to response for pembrolizumab is 1.4 to 8.2 months (median, 2.2 months) \\[ 9 \\], using pembrolizumab to treat CUPs may be difficult even if the tumour cells show a strong intensity and are 100% positive for PD-L1 expression.\n\n【49】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【50】The authors thank Dr Tomohiro Goda, Department of Medical Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine for the ALK, PD-L1 and PAX8 staining and for the genetic analyses of the EGFR gene and ROS1 gene fusion.

The development of tolerance and immunogical effects of these agents in people living with HIV are not well assessed as these persons are often excluded from clinical trials. Herein, we report a case of a Caucasian woman who received multiple sequential immunotherapies for severe ulcerative colitis. Due to steroid-refractory disease, receipt of maximal doses of mesalamine and initial repeated decline of surgical intervention, she went on to receive biologic immune inhibitors like tumor necrosis fator-α blockers infliximab and adalimumab, the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab, anti-interleukin 12/23 blocker ustekinumab and Janus Kinase inihibitor tofacitinib without achieving remission. Only minor infectious complications were encountered and no significant changes in CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio occurred. This case provides support for the safety and tolerability of the above immunotherapies in people living with HIV with suppressed viral load on antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), one provides immunosuppressive therapy with the hope of tempering excessive inflammation while preserving immune function. However, if the proper balance between immunosuppression and immune preservation is not achieved, an individual will be tipped into immunodeficiency with increased infection risk. People living with HIV (PLWH) are often excluding from clinical trials involving biologics based on concerns of additive immunosuppression and infection risk. Consequently, little data are available to guide clinicians in managing PLWH who suffer from advanced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, we present the case of young woman with HIV infection and extensive UC refractory to many therapies. Following repeated decline of surgical intervention, she was treated with multiple sequential immunomodulators and did not experience any major adverse effects.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old, Canadian-born Caucasian woman was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. She began antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil 300 mg/emtracitabine 200 mg orally once daily and raltegravir 400 mg orally twice daily in 2012, when her CD4 count rapidly dropped to 86 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Later that year, she began experiencing frequent episodes of bloody diarrhea, with up to 20 stools daily, with cramping, rectal bleeding and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Stool was repeatedly negative for _Clostridium difficile_ and ova and parasites. Colonoscopy demonstrated severe pancolitis and biopsies consistent with active UC with acute cryptitis, crypt abcesses with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal erosions, acute inflammatory exudate with architectural disortion. Hematoxylin and eosin stains for cytomegalovirus and histochemical exams for Herpes Simplex Virus I/II were negative. Despite high doses of oral prednisone (40–60 mg daily) and several emergency room visits to receive intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for flares, she was deemed steroid-refractory.\n\n【6】Later that year, she received maximum doses of oral mesalamine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as mesalamine suppositories and enemas. She then received infliximab (2012–2013), an antitumor necrois fator-α (anti-TNFα) monoclonal antibody, until antibody formation. Despite maximum doses of adalimumab (2014), her UC remained refractory although no antibodies were detected using a drug-tolerant assay and medication levels were therapeutic (>12 μg/ml, the highest limit of detection). Attempts to taper her steroids resulted in flare-ups and a cushingoid feature. She declined colectomy as she felt this would interfere with her lifestyle, especially since she was getting married, and concerns about her future fertility.\n\n【7】One of the options explored was the use of vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against α4β7 integrin, via a clinical trial. However, due to the patient’s HIV infection she was not eligible to participate in any of the recruiting trials at the centre as HIV infection is frequently an exclusion criteria. Colonoscopy in 2015 revealed severe inflammation with ulcerations and friability consistent with Mayo 3 colitis, despite high-dose steroids and adalimumab, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 80 mg weekly. By December 2015, vedolizumab was obtained through standard of care and initiated at 300 mg IV at weeks 0 and 2, 6 (loading dose) and then every 8 weeks thereafter as a maintenance dose. She was still bleeding from the rectum and had decreased weight, therefore daily prednisone 10 mg orally was maintained. She achieved clinical remission by March 2016 and steroids were stopped. Two months later, she developed right foot cellulitis following a minor trauma during a pedicure and required 48 hours of IV followed by oral antibiotics.\n\n【8】Colonoscopy in June 2016, 3 months after stopping steroids, showed worsening condition with Mayo 3 colitis, so she was changed to vedolizumab 300 mg IV q 4 weeks and prednisone increased to 40 mg orally (po) daily. Anti-α4β7 antibodies were not detected. She was passing bright red blood per rectum 12 times in 24 hours and having five stools per 24 hours with lower abdominal cramping and rectal pain. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinab 10 mg po twice daily, was initiated October 2016 and prednisone 40 mg po daily maintained. Symptoms persisted requiring admission for IV prednisolone, but she continued to decline surgical colectomy. She also developed a bacterial vaginitis treated with metronidazole cream and later a skin furuncle, treated with oral antibiotics.\n\n【9】Following tofacitinib, she received interleukin 12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab March–September 2017. She gained 30 pounds in 1 year (body mass index 37), increased abdominal fat and bilateral cataracts due to cortisone. Attempts to decrease prednisone below 30 mg daily led to bloody diarrhea (12–17 bowel movements daily). She eventually accepted to undergo subtotal abdominal colectomy (pathology shown in Fig. 1 ) with rectal stump and temporary end ileostomy by June 2018. She improved and was seen for follow-up a month post-op, at which time she was having increasing right lower quadrant pain and rising CRP. A computed tomography scan demonstrated collections in the subcutaneous fat surrounding the ostomy and a second collection centimeter with rim enhancement and fat stranding. These were drained and cultures grew _E. coli_ and _B. fragilis_ . She responded to IV antibiotics for 3 days followed by oral step-down antibiotics to complete 2 weeks. Eight months following her colectomy, she developed polyarthralgia in her interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, knees and feet with a normal CRP and a negative Rheumatoid Factor while off prednisone, thought to be either inflammatory or mechanical polyarthralgia. Pathology on surveillance sigmoidoscopy March 2019 demonstrated chronic active proctitis with ulceration consistent with chronic idiopathic IBD. Throughout this entire time, her CD4 range was between 400 and 900 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.41:1.12, and HIV viral load remained suppressed since November 2012.\n\n【10】**Figure 1**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Colonic resection histology. The colonic mucosa shows characteristic features of chronic ulcerative colitis including crypt architecture alteration, cryptitis, crypt abscess and focal mucosa ulceration. There is no evidence of dysplasia.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Due to repeated decline of surgery in order to preserve her quality of life and fertility, this woman with HIV and refractory UC received all available conventional therapies including mesalamine, glucocorticoids, thiopurines, antagonists to TNF- α, IL-12/23 blockers and anti-α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin. She also received a small-molecule JAK inhibitor. TNF-α inhibitors and α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blockers are used with extreme caution in PLWH due to concerns of additional immunosuppression and subsequent infection risk. However, during her 6 years of being on immunosuppressants, the patient only experienced one episode of cellulitis, bacterial vaginosis, a skin furuncle and peristomal abscesses, all of which were easily managed with traditional therapies. Another concern with the use of integrin receptor antagonists in PLWH, although rare, is the possibility of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy due to John Cunningham (JC) virus \\[ 1 \\]. Our patient underwent blood plasma JC virus testing prior to vedolizumab initiation and this polymerase chain reaction testing was negative. She also denied any neurological signs or symptoms throughout treatment.\n\n【15】This woman’s case demonstrates that the spectrum of drug classes available and sequential use of biologics for treatment of UC were safe in this patient with well-controlled HIV infection ART, including an TNF-α blocker, JK inhibitor, IL-12/23 blocker and the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab. Our patient did not incur any significant changes in her CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio during the course of her treatments and infections were relatively minor. Although we did not use combination biologics in this patient, their efficacy and safety for IBD and other and other inflammatory diseases associated was explored in a systematic review of observational studies which did not find any differences related to improvements in disease condition, adverse effects or infection rates in patients receiving combined treatment compared to placebo groups \\[ 2 \\]. A clinical trial (NCT02764762) examining efficacy and safety of combined vedolizumab, adalimumab and oral methotrexate in patients with Crohn’s Disease is in progress \\[ 3 \\]. Until evidence from clinical trials is available on efficacy and safety of biologics and combination therapy in PLWH, case reports and case series provide a channel for dissemination of these experiences within the medical community.\n\n【16】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【17】The authors thank Pathologist, Dr Zu-hua Gao, for provision of the histology image.

Our case is the first case that depicts development of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) following infection with COVID-19, with a challenging diagnosis and spontaneous improvement. A 65-year-old diabetic female presented with a complete external ophthalmopegia in the left eye and a severe left-sided headache. The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Brain and orbital computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were both unremarkable. We diagnosed the case as THS after ruling out other differential diagnoses. The patient refused to receive prednisone, so we had to observe her closely for 6 months during which period we recorded a spontaneous recovery. Acute ophthalmoplegia is a very challenging presentation. It needs full workup to exclude the wide range of differential diagnoses.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Since the start of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, a number of both benign and vision-threatening neuro-ophthalmic manifestations have been documented in COVID-19 cases \\[ 1 \\] of which we cite optic neuritis, nystagmus, visual field abnormalities, headache, diplopia, visual impairment, ocular pain, Miller Fisher syndrome and painful cranial neuropathies \\[ 2–4 \\].\n\n【4】Cranial neuropathies, especially painful ophthalmoplegia, have a wide range of differential diagnoses, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Here, we have a rare case of complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with unremarkable radiological findings and spontaneous remission through long-term observation.\n\n【5】The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 65-year-old Caucasian female with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was admitted to our ophthalmology department. She presented with left periocular pain, droopy eyelid and left ocular movement limitation for a period of 4 days. Two weeks before admission, she had had a severe left-sided headache unresponsive to sedatives, along with fatigue, dry cough and fever. The patient denied any history of trauma or recreational drug use.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed a complete external ophthalmoplegia on the left eye and total left ptosis with a mild chemosis. The pupil was semi-dilated and non-reactive to light. We also recorded mild proptosis on Hertel exophthalmometer (3-mm discrepancy between the two eyes). Uncorrected visual acuity was 0.6 (0.18 LogMAR), intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg and Ishihara color test was normal ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Photograph of the patient in six positions at the presentation, showing prominent ophthalmoplegia in the left eye.\n\n【12】The patient was conscious, oriented and responsive to stimuli. Tendon reflexes and muscle tone were all within normal limits. There were no meningeal or cerebellar signs. Ear, nose and throat examinations were within normal as well. Sensory system examination was totally normal at presentation. However, a left corneal hypoesthesia appeared 2 days after admission, which was consistent with an injury in the first branch of the fifth cranial nerve.\n\n【13】Laboratory studies (including CBC, PT, INR, D-Dimer, ferritin, urea, LDH, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, sodium, potassium and calcium) were all within normal limits. By contrast, C-reactive protein was elevated (11.4 mg/l) and so was blood glucose (300 mg/dl).\n\n【14】Polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was positive, and brain and orbital computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both unremarkable. There was no sign of inflammation nor of a mass.\n\n【15】The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) was made after the exclusion of other pathologies. The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 unit for close observation and blood glucose control and for the overall management of her COVID-19 symptoms. Brain MRI was normal upon its repetition after a week.\n\n【16】The patient’s status later improved, and she was discharged home with monthly reviewing.\n\n【17】On follow-up, her ocular symptoms and signs started to improve spontaneously 3 months after admission. A regression in the ptosis, a partial recovery in the third and fourth cranial nerves were detected. She could adduct, elevate and depress the left eye into primary and adduction positions.\n\n【18】Corneal sensation was recovered 5 months after presentation. She could fully open her left eye. The pupil became round, regular and reactive to light, but she was unable to abduct the eye. This meant a complete spontaneous restoration of the third, fourth and first branches of the fifth cranial nerve ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n【19】Figure 2\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Photograph of the patient in nine positions after 5-month follow-up, showing improvement in the eye movements except for the sixth nerve in the left eye.\n\n【22】By the end of the 6-month period, all the involved nerve functions were restored except for the sixth nerve and the patient ended up with exotropia. At present, the patient is complaining of diplopia and is being prepared for strabismus surgery.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】Reports of neuro-ophthalmic complications in COVID-19 patients, such as cranial nerve paresis, optic neuritis and gaze palsy, are being increasingly described in the literature. This is a case of an infrequent presentation of painful complete ophthalmoplegia in a COVID-19-positive patient with radiologically normal imaging. We documented the natural course of the spontaneous remission of the neuropathies with no treatment.\n\n【25】Cranial nerve palsies with COVID-19 were reported. However, to our knowledge, this is the first case to report a concomitant four cranial nerves palsies, CN III, IV, V and VI.\n\n【26】Ophthalmoparesis has a wide range of differential diagnoses; multiple sclerosis, neoplasms, malignancies, giant cell arteritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, THS, diabetes mellitus and cavernous sinus thrombosis.\n\n【27】In this specific case, there was acute severe complete external ophthalmoplegia, left corneal hypoesthesia, total ptosis and mild proptosis, with a history of severe headache and cough. We made the diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS) after ruling out all the other pathologies.\n\n【28】Our patient had normal CT and MRI with no signs of masses or hyperintensity at presentation. They were also normal on repetition after a week. We could not use gadolinium for it was unavailable in our hospital.\n\n【29】Although the patient had uncontrolled diabetes, the clinical presentation was far from the classic presentation of diabetic ophthalmoplegia; it indicated a pathology in the orbital apex rather than only a diabetic ischemia. Our patient had severe and acute paralysis of three cranial nerves simultaneously, and all the nerves enter the cranial cavity through the orbital apex. As well as, the sensitive part of the fifth nerve was injured. Based on clinical presentation and MRI findings, we were able to rule out the most notable differential diagnoses and make the diagnosis of THS. The THS diagnosis is a triad of one or more episodes of unilateral orbital pain, paresis of one or more of the cranial nerves and granulomas in MRI or biopsy; which is sensitive for the diagnosis of the syndrome. However, the fact that over half of the reported cases had normal MRI renders the diagnosis dependent on the exclusion of other etiologies \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【30】The patient was not given the corticosteroids treatment at her demand. She showed spontaneous remission and had to be monitored over a 6-month period.\n\n【31】Since our patient was positive for COVID-19, and there was no detection of any other possible etiology such as other infections, trauma, tumor or malignancy, we theorize that the SARS-COV-2 virus may have triggered an immunological reaction leading to the development of the ophthalmoplegia, which we believe is THS.\n\n【32】Our case is the first to report the development of complete acute ophthalmoplegia following COVID-19 infection with normal MRI and spontaneous improvement.\n\n【33】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【34】We would like to express our great appreciation to Mr Zain Hummamy for his valuable efforts toward ensuring both the linguistic correctness and the linguistic accuracy of the study.\n\n【35】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【36】All the authors does not have any conflicts of interest.\n\n【37】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【38】No funding was received for this work.\n\n【39】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【40】No approval is required.\n\n【41】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【42】Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images were obtained from the patient.

The patient was presumed to be adherent on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and was initiated on respective treatments for the opportunistic infections but continued to deteriorate. On further reviewing, he was found to be poorly adherent to ART and was advised enhanced adherence counselling after which his condition improved. We report this case to emphasize the importance of adherence to ART medications in the management of patients with HIV.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have high morbidity and mortality owing to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Early diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of management in patients with advanced HIV. Although a lot of stress is laid on the initiation of therapy, monitoring of compliance and importance of adherence in management is often neglected. We present a case of advanced HIV with multiple opportunistic infections to emphasize that adherence to ART is the most effective tool in managing patients with advanced HIV, and poor treatment adherence is associated with adverse outcomes.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old gentleman who worked in the para-military forces presented to a secondary care hospital with intermittent high-grade fever associated with loss of appetite and weight (around 10 kg) for a year. He was found to be positive for HIV-1 infection and was advised ART. He did not initiate ART and presented 2 months later to us with fever, shortness of breath and loose stools for 15 days. He was found to have a CD4 count of 62/mcl. A chest X-ray and computed tomography of the chest was done for these complaints, which was suggestive of _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia. He was managed in the intensive care unit with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and steroids. After 2 days of initiation of treatment, he developed erythema over forearm, neck, chest and extremities. This was accompanied by oral mucosal involvement and punctate keratopathy. He was diagnosed as Steven Johnson syndrome-toxic epidemo-necrolysis overlap secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was immediately stopped, and he was put on steroids. His lesions resolved in next 2 weeks and he was started on tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz along with dapsone prophylaxis. ART was not started earlier as both tenofovir and efavirenz could have worsened the skin condition. He was discharged in a stable condition. He reported proper compliance in all his out-patient visits. Eighteen months into the illness, he started to have dysphagia and small bowel type of diarrhoea (15–20 times/day, non-bloody, not associated with abdominal pain and tenesmus) for which he was admitted. On upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, he was found to have oesophagal candidiasis and was started on fluconazole. Stool microscopy revealed _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts, and he was initiated on nitazoxanide. However, he continued to have diarrhoea with multiple stool samples detecting _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts and had persistent dyselectrolytemia for which oral supplementation was given. He continued to deteriorate and was found to have features of dehydration, severe wasting, candidiasis (oral) and diffuse ichthyosis on examination. Dosage of nitazoxanide was increased, and azithromycin was added once daily for cryptosporidiosis to which he responded partially.\n\n【6】His CD4 count was zero, and viral load was high. His previous CD4 counts done at six-monthly intervals after the baseline count of CD4 of 62/mcl were 104/mcl and 76/mcl. With suspicion of failure, he was started on zidovudine, lamivudine and atazanavir/ritonavir. Single-tablet regimen with a protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitor was not available under the national scheme for use in this patient. HIV resistance genotyping did not detect any resistance to any of the tested drugs. On reviewing the history, he reported decreased adherence to the ART medications as he avoided taking his medications in front of his co-workers on outstation postings. He also seemed to be extremely worried about his ill health. He was counselled about the severity of his condition and the importance of adherence. He was referred to a trained psychologist for evaluation. He was found to be depressed and was started on anti-depressant by the psychiatrist. He was continued on a PI-based therapy, owing to its higher barrier to resistance, considering his history of non-compliance.\n\n【7】He continued to have persistent diarrhoea along with dysphagia not responding to fluconazole. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis was suspected in addition to candidiasis based on raised CMV viral load and UGI endoscopy findings. He was started on valganciclovir after which his CMV viral load became negative. His diarrhoea and dysphagia eventually improved and was discharged on PI-based ART, dapsone prophylaxis and fluconazole. He was also registered for regular follow-up with the psychologist and psychiatrist.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Cryptosporidiosis is commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV with an overall prevalence of 8.7%. These patients present with a diarrheal illness which may last for months resulting in weight loss, malnutrition and extended hospitalization \\[ 1 \\]. Although nitazoxanide is approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, it is often ineffective. Other agents like azithromycin and PIs have been tried with minimal success. Effective ART is probably the most effective tool in managing patients with cryptosporidiosis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】CMV infection is associated with rapid HIV disease progression and consequently, more acquired immune deficiency syndrome related events. ART is not only effective in controlling HIV replication but also decreases CMV-related adverse events by the restoration of CMV-specific immunity \\[ 3 \\]. CMV-related gastrointestinal disease is seen in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression. Oesophagus and colon are the most important sites that are affected \\[ 4 \\]. Ganciclovir/valganciclovir, along with the initiation of effective ART, is the treatment of choice.\n\n【11】India has a total of >2 million HIV-positive individuals \\[ 5 \\]. Most of these patients are managed in ART centres linked to the national programme. The national programme was initiated in 1992, and it has been giving free ART to all HIV registered HIV patients since 2004 \\[ 5 \\]. The programme continues to give free ART to all the registered patients despite the decrease in its funding. The national programme has tried to keep up with the recommendations on the treatment given by the World Health Organisation. Since 2013, the first-line treatment has been a single-tablet regimen of tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz \\[ 5 \\]. For those who fail the first-line treatment, they are shifted to a two-pill regimen containing atazanavir/ritonavir. While the programme works fairly well for most patients, in this patient, there were certain challenges. At the time, the patient presented routine viral load monitoring was not available for all patients at the centre. It was done only for those patients where immunological failure was suspected. Despite access to free ART, the number of centres that dispense medications is limited, leading to high patient turn over in each centre. Due to the high patient turn, the time spent with each patient is suboptimal, leading to a poor patient–physician relationship. Also, adherence is measured by pill counting method and therefore, it is easy to miss non-compliance. Single-tablet regimen with dolutegravir has been recently introduced in the national scheme, but it was not available at the time, the patient was being managed.\n\n【12】Variable drug adherence was noted (47–90%) in the studies from Indian centres \\[ 6 \\]. The problem of drug adherence is further compounded by high pill burden, poor health literacy and treatment-related side effects in patients with HIV \\[ 7 \\]. Poor treatment adherence to ART is associated with inadequate viral suppression, increased resistance and increased opportunistic infections \\[ 7–9 \\]. It is essential to spend time with the patient and understand his/her problems during the initiation of ART. Patients are often scared of revealing their medical condition to their employers for fear of being judged and losing their job. It is also essential to empowering the patient about their rights \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Poor treatment adherence to ART, due to various socio-economic factors, is often missed by healthcare staffs \\[ 10 \\]. It is imperative to consider the social aspects like living conditions, economic support, working conditions and family support.\n\n【13】Potential solutions to improve adherence include better education and motivation of patients, early referral for diagnosis and treatment, home visits, an increase in human resources and, creating social support groups. Patient education programmes are essential not only in the hospital but also in the communities near patients’ residence. This would help to dispel the misconceptions and stigma associated with HIV infection. Adherence counselling, although a time-consuming process is an advantageous intervention in terms of overall patient outcome.\n\n【14】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【15】Nil.\n\n【16】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【17】None declared.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】None to declare.\n\n【20】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【21】Not applicable.\n\n【22】Consent was taken prior to publications.\n\n【23】Guarantor—same as the corresponding author.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Only a handful of case reports have reported stones larger than 10 cm, and most of these cases are managed surgically. We present a case of a 56-year-old female who presented with vague, lower urinary tract symptoms who was later found to have severe post-renal acute kidney injury due to a giant bladder stone measuring 11 × 11 × 10.4 cm.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】While a wealth of literature addresses the incidence, management and long-term follow-up for kidney and ureteral stones, there is sparse literature describing the same for bladder stones.\n\n【4】An exceedingly rare subgroup of this entity are bladder stones measuring more than 10 × 10 cm that have been referred to as ‘giant’ bladder stones in the few case reports documented worldwide. Infections and urinary stasis are implicated as the inciting event for the formation of these entities; however the evidence is limited given the lack of large, epidemiologic studies \\[ 1 \\]. Little is known about the pathophysiology, composition and etiology of these stones.\n\n【5】We describe a case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented with severe post-obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI) due to a giant bladder stone.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and dysuria for 3 days. She reported a history of multiple episodes dysuria that had been treated with unspecified antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past 6 months in Mexico. She had also been suffering from a chronic, pressure-like sensation in the lower abdomen and increased urinary frequency with relief upon lying in a recumbent position. She did not have any gynecological history, including any prior surgical procedures. On physical examination, she was febrile to 101.9°F, tachycardic to 112 beats/min and had a firm, mobile, subumbilical mass with bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed a white blood cells (WBC) count of 13 100 cells/μL with left shift, a serum creatinine of 6.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen of 115 mg/dL. Her urinalysis revealed 676 red blood cells, 929 WBC and positive leukocyte esterase; there was no bacterial growth in the final culture. Non-contrasted computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a large calcified stone measuring 11 × 11 × 10.4 cm (Figs 1 and 2 ) nearly occluding the urinary bladder with bilateral hydroureter and hydronephrosis.\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Computed tomography image of the large urinary bladder stone completely filling the urinary bladder.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Three-dimensional reconstruction of the bladder stone.\n\n【14】She was diagnosed with post-renal AKI due to urolithiasis and associated acute, bilateral pyelonephritis. Piperacillin–tazobactam was initiated and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tubes were placed. On Day 3, she underwent open vesicolithotomy and suprapubic tube (SPT) placement with removal of the large, white stone (Fig. 3 ). The stone culture grew one colony of coagulase negative Staphylococcal species, and stone composition was not reported. On postoperative Day 3, she was discharged due to improvement of the kidney function and treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin–clavulanate. After 2 weeks, she was seen in urology clinic where both the Foley catheter and bilateral PCN tubes were removed. SPT was removed 3 months later when her post-void urine quantity was below 50 ml and she was asymptomatic. Given complete recovery, urodynamic studies to assess underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction were not pursued.\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Immediate, post-operative gross image of the large urinary bladder calculi.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Nephrolithiasis is a common problem with increasing incidence and prevalence. One in every 11 people in the USA will report a symptomatic kidney stone by the age of 70 years, with higher prevalence in men than women \\[ 2 \\]. Additionally, rising rates of obesity have been shown to contribute to the increasing prevalence of these stones \\[ 3 \\]. Only 5% of these calculi affect the lower urinary tract, the bladder or the urethra \\[ 1 , 4 \\].\n\n【20】Urinary bladder stones are usually seen in conditions associated with urinary stasis such as bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder; however spontaneous formations have also been reported \\[ 1 \\]. Common causes of bladder outlet obstruction include an enlarged prostate, urethral strictures and medication side effects. Pelvic surgeries and genital prolapse, resulting in obstruction, foreign bodies such as Foley catheter, hair and even intravaginal accessories have been implicated as causes for bladder stones in females \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. In these conditions, the contents of urine such as calcium, oxalate, phosphate and uric acid precipitate forming crystals, which eventually progress to form larger stones \\[ 6 \\]. In 15% of cases, the underlying pathology is recurrent UTIs by a urease-forming organism that alters the pH of urine-forming struvite stones. Bladder stones are often associated with renal and ureteral stones; however they can occur alone. Bladder stones are rare in females accounting for only 5% of the cases \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Post-renal AKI is caused by calculi in most patients. Other potential etiologies are benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic or pelvic neoplasms or retroperitoneal fibrosis \\[ 8 , 10 \\]. Stones causing AKI are usually bilateral in the kidneys, ureter or urethra. It is rare for bladder stones to become large enough to cause bilateral hydronephrosis, hydroureter and AKI but was seen in our patient where her stone was large enough to limit the flow of urine resulting in kidney injury. Management of these giant bladder stones is vesicolithotomy, as supported by prior case reports \\[ 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【21】This particular case is unique in that our patient had no discernable risk factors for the formation of a bladder stone. While she reported a history of recurrent UTIs, it is unclear whether these symptoms occurred prior to the formation of the bladder stone or if the stone resulted in urinary frequency with findings of pyuria and microscopic hematuria \\[ 1 \\]. Lack of a complete past medical history pertaining to infections, antibiotic use and the limitations to health care access in the patient’s home country of Mexico makes the diagnosis of underlying etiology challenging.\n\n【22】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【23】To our knowledge, there are only a few cases of giant bladder stones presenting with complications of kidney injury. Due to the relative rarity of giant bladder stones, there is not enough data on the incidence, management and long-term follow-up on this entity; however, an early diagnosis and surgical management are needed to prevent permanent kidney injury, ensure appropriate evaluation for underlying risk factors, as well as optimize surveillance for recurring stones.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】All authors declare no financial disclosure or competing interests and approved this submission.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Although no patient identities were used, the patient provided her informed consent.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Rohit Agrawal, MD.\n\n【34】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【35】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8ee5d921-db9e-45d7-82ae-dd5707f49ff5", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】Narcotic bowel syndrome is defined as worsening abdominal bloating and cramping with chronic opiate use, leading to paralytic ileus. This syndrome is common yet underreported in adults. However, there is no current evidence of such conditions in the newborn after exposure _in utero_ to high doses of opiates. Our patient was a female indigenous preterm infant born to a mother on a high dose of methadone. On admission at the age of 12 h, she was found to have significant gastric distension. Initial abdominal X-ray showed a large gastric bubble with little evidence of rectal gas. Malrotation was suspected and surgical intervention was discussed. However, repeat abdominal X-ray, ultrasound and upper Gastrointestinal series were found to be normal and without acute findings. Thus, surgery was avoided. The gastric distension resolved spontaneously. She never required opiate therapy for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Given the pattern of gas seen on the initial abdominal X-ray and its spontaneous resolution after removal of maternal methadone, we suspect this baby had neonatal narcotic bowel syndrome. This has never been reported in the literature and is a unique finding. Given the lack of current reports, further observations for this syndrome should be conducted.\n\n【2】paralytic ileus , neonate , maternal methadone\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Opioids are potent analgesic agents used to treat severe pain that is both acute and chronic in nature \\[ 1 \\]. Common side effects include constipation and bowel dysfunction \\[ 1 \\]. This is a result of action of opioids on receptors that line the gastrointestinal tract \\[ 1 \\]. Chronic opiate use could lead to the bowel dysfunction, constipations or paralytic ileus \\[ 2 \\]. In the pregnant population, illicit opioid use is found in approximately 0.1% of all pregnancies \\[ 3 \\]. Currently, the recommended pharmacotherapy for opioid dependency in the antenatal period is methadone, which was found to diminish illicit use \\[ 3–5 \\]. The most common side effect of maternal methadone and opiate use is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a set of signs and symptoms related to nervous system dysfunction that increases morbidity and prolongs NICU stay \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. In the available literature, we did not find reports describing early-onset gastrointestinal dysfunction in the neonates exposed to opiates and methadone _in utero_ . In the given case report, we present a neonate with physical signs and radiologic evidence of ileus secondary to maternal methadone ingestion.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】This baby girl was born via home spontaneous vaginal delivery at approximately 32 weeks to a mother with no prenatal care or ultrasounds. She was HIV negative, and the remainder of serology results and GBS status were unknown. Subsequent postnatal screening was negative. The mother had a remote history of illicit drug use and was on maintenance therapy with methadone 100 mg/day throughout pregnancy. She was taking it as prescribed, which was confirmed by home visits. She had no other illicit substance use. She did intermittently smoke cigarettes and marijuana during the first trimester of pregnancy. She did not specify any alcohol use. Baby was born at home by spontaneous precipitous delivery and brought to a peripheral hospital by ambulance for further care. Her birth weight was 1392 g. Secondary to worsening respiratory distress, she was intubated and transferred to our tertiary care center.\n\n【7】On admission, she was screened for infection and started on empiric antibiotics. Blood cultures were negative. Baby was clinically stable but was found to have abdominal distension and was nil per os. The initial abdominal X-ray ( Fig. 1a ) showed massive gastric distension with minimal gas pattern in the rest of the gut. There was no concern of duodenal atresia given the gas pattern; however, gastric outlet obstruction or malrotation could not be ruled out. Intermittent NG suctioning was then applied for gastric decompression and only air was aspirated. No vomiting or bilious aspirates were noted. An abdominal X-ray was repeated an hour later, showing the stomach had been deflated with air again being present in the distal transverse, descending and rectosigmoid colon ( Fig. 1b ). A further X-ray was done 2 h later showing reaccumulation of air in the stomach and bowel loops distended throughout the left abdomen ( Fig. 1c ).\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】( **a** – **c** ) Progression of the abdominal X-ray from an appearance of gastric outlet obstruction (a) to fairly decompressed (b) to a complete pattern of distension throughout the stomach, small and large bowels (c).\n\n【11】Therefore, an abdominal ultrasound was conducted to rule out malrotation and assess the gut vasculature. The superior mesenteric artery and vein were found to be in normal orientation. Furthermore, pediatric surgery was promptly consulted after the ultrasound and saw no acute need for exploratory laparotomy. They recommended an upper Gastrointestinal (GI) series after 2 days of gastric decompression. In the meantime, the patient was hemodynamically stable. The upper GI series showed no acute obstruction or other significant findings ( Fig. 2a–d ). The abdominal distension resolved within 72 h of life at which time she passed meconium. Feeds were started with preterm formula at the same time and were tolerated well. No further abdominal foci was identified. She was successfully extubated on Day 7 of life and off respiratory support by Day 9 of life. Screening head ultrasounds and chest X-rays were normal. The infant had no clinical signs of NAS. Feeds were progressed over the subsequent 3 weeks on standard formula prior to discharge after a total of 6 weeks in NICU.\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】( **a** – **c** ) Normal upper GI series; ( **d** , **e** ) normal upper GI series and final X-ray showing normal distribution of contrast throughout the small and large bowel.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】For more than 30 years, methadone has been used as a first-line medication for opioid substitution therapy during pregnancy \\[ 5 \\]. Despite the strong evidence supporting the use of methadone in pregnancy, methadone use is not without risk or side effects \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Methadone does not only cross the placental barrier but is also retained by the placenta in a substantial amount \\[ 4 \\]. There is not enough data describing fetal opioid elimination, however, placental inactivation of methadone is significantly lower than that of the maternal liver \\[ 6–8 \\]. The elimination half-life of methadone in an opioid-tolerant patient is approximately 24 h; and in neonates, it could be as high as 40–55 h \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The extended elimination half-life in neonates contributes to higher mg per kg-based dose \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【17】There is well-documented evidence of delay of feeding onset and attaining full feeds in neonates with NAS or exposed to morphine in the NICU for analgesia \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Fortunately, these effects are transient with no acquired GI complications \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Our patient was off respiratory support in 9 days. Her infectious status was negative. However, abdominal distension persisted for 72 h. Her mother did not use other substances late in pregnancy other than methadone. Given that the neonate reported in this case study did not show signs of NAS, it seems less likely that we can contribute her clinical picture of ileus to her methadone exposure. However, the preterm neonates have lower rates of NAS compared to term babies \\[ 8 \\], so she may not have displayed symptoms of withdrawal due to her prematurity. This association may well be due to the challenges of assessment of NAS in preterm infants and a lack of a validated scoring system specifically designed for this population \\[ 9 \\]. It is important to consider maternal substance use when interpreting abdominal films and clinical signs of a surgical abdomen. These findings may help reduce the need for exploratory laparotomy in neonates presenting with a query of a surgical abdomen, if maternal substance use history is known.\n\n【18】Interestingly, there was a case report of an infant in Italy who experienced similar paralytic ileus after treatment with fentanyl for procedural sedation while ventilated \\[ 10 \\]. Although the exposure was of a different nature, it is important nevertheless to know that any opioid derivative has the capacity to induce ileus in the neonate, whether prenatal or postnatal. Furthermore, another preterm infant whose mother was taking clonazepam, a benzodiazepine for epilepsy, was also born with concern of a paralytic ileus \\[ 10 \\]. This adds further support to the argument that neurologically depressing agents use by a mother during pregnancy, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, must be considered when observing an infant with radiological and clinical signs of an obstructive pathology before advancing that neonate for laparotomy.\n\n【19】In conclusion, the given neonate was born premature after significant _in utero_ exposure to methadone and was thought to have a malrotation on imaging. After ruling out a surgical cause of obstruction, the only factor that could be associated with such significant ileus was determined to be maternal methadone consumption. Given the pattern of gas seen on the initial abdominal X-ray and its spontaneous resolution after 72 h, we suspect this baby had paralytic ileus secondary to maternal methadone treatment. This has never been reported in the literature and is a unique finding. Hence, this correlation is a reminder to neonatology decision makers that maternal substance use may be a significant considering factor when sending a patient with small bowel obstruction to the operating theater. Given the lack of current reports, further surveillance for this phenomenon should be conducted.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】No sources of funding were used.\n\n【24】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【25】Ethics approval for said case report was waived.

Although most patients with a PFO are asymptomatic, various clinical manifestations may be associated with PFO. The most important is a cryptogenic stroke. Concomitant acute pulmonary embolism (APE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to paradoxical embolism from a PFO are extremely rare. We describe a 77-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension who was transferred due to a sudden onset of dyspnea followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Based on the patient’s medical history, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, coronary angiography, and a whole-body contrasted computed tomography, we diagnosed concomitant APE, AMI and AIS caused by a paradoxical embolism from a PFO. Appropriate knowledge of the pathophysiology of this rare critical illness is important for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A patent foramen ovale (PFO) occurs in ~20–30% of the general population and is a major cause of paradoxical embolism \\[ 1 \\]. A possible mechanism for PFO-related systemic embolic events is a paradoxical embolism, a thrombus from the peripheral venous system that crosses an interatrial defect into the systemic circulation \\[ 2 \\]. It is rare to find acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to paradoxical embolism \\[ 3 \\], and its incidence has been reported as <1% \\[ 4 \\]. Although several AMI cases studies alone or with concomitant AMI and acute pulmonary embolism (APE) with paradoxical embolism due to a PFO have been reported \\[ 5–7 \\], concomitant AMI, APE and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) resulting in cardiac arrest are extremely rare. We describe a case of a patient with paradoxical embolism as concomitant APE, AMI and AIS. The patient’s medical history suggested that APE caused cardiac arrest, and pulmonary hypertension from APE led to a right-to-left shunt due to the PFO, which resulted in AMI and AIS.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension felt severe dyspnea after waking up in the morning and called emergency medical services. When the paramedics arrived, she had collapsed, and an electrocardiogram revealed asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, and she was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital. The return of spontaneous circulation was confirmed 60 minutes after her collapse. Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asynergy of left ventricle lower wall motion, left ventricular retraction due to right ventricle dilation (D-shape); tricuspid regurgitation (TR) flow was 3.1 m/sec, and the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient (TR-PG) was 38.7 mmHg ( Fig. 1A and B ). In addition, regional wall motion abnormality of the basal and mid right ventricular free wall with apical hyper contractility (McConnell’s sign) was observed. Based on these findings, he was suspected to have an AMI complicated by an APE. An emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI was performed. Coronary angiography revealed 100% thrombus occlusion of the distal segment of the right coronary artery (RCA, 4PD) and no obvious stenosis of the other coronary arteries. Balloon dilatation and thrombus aspiration provided complete reperfusion with Grade 3 TIMI blood flow for 4PD occlusion without stenting ( Fig. 2 ). A subsequent whole-body computed tomography (CT) was performed to look for thrombosis and determine the cause of the pulmonary embolism. A contrasted chest CT revealed filling defects in the right peripheral pulmonary artery ( Fig. 3A ), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis was found in the lower limbs. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for post-resuscitation management. Initially, a right-to-left shunt involved in the mechanism of the concurrent AMI and APE was suspected. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a PFO and blood flow from the right to the left atrium ( Fig. 1C ). Despite the absence of sedation and stable hemodynamics, she remained unconscious. The brain CT did not show an abnormality on admission; however, a follow-up brain CT revealed hypodensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres on Day 4 ( Fig. 3B ). Based on these findings, we diagnosed APE, AMI and AIS. The suspected mechanism of these multiple embolisms was paradoxical embolism due to a PFO. We administered intravenous heparin for her multiple thrombi. Although there was possibility to be underlying some malignancy and PFO closure was a curative treatment, because of her severe neurological dysfunction caused by the ischemic stroke, no further tests were performed and her family did not consent to PFO closure. She left the intensive care unit on Day 9 and was discharged from the hospital on Day 53 with supportive care taking edoxaban 30 mg daily.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Transthoracic echocardiography shows left ventricular retraction due to right ventricular dilation ( **A** ).

The head CT on Day 5 revealed hypodensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres ( **B** , arrow).\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】We considered the following hypotheses regarding the development of multiple paradoxical embolisms in this case. Deep venous thrombus led to APE and caused pulmonary hypertension, which elevated right atrial pressure. The elevated right atrial pressure opened a PFO and caused a right-to-left shunt. The residual thrombus crossed the PFO from the right to the left atrium and entered the arterial circulation, causing an embolic myocardial infarction. Her sudden onset of dyspnea without chest pain and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest with asystole suggested APE than typical AMI. The transthoracic and esophageal echocardiogram and the coronary angiography findings suggested these hypotheses. Subsequent AMI was explained by paradoxical embolism due to a PFO with elevated right atrial pressure. The AIS in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres was suggestive of a watershed infarct and may have been caused by global hypoperfusion, presumably at the time of cardiac arrest due to AMI and APE. It was reasonable to assume that these APE, AMI and AIS had developed in this sequence of events.\n\n【17】Anti-thrombotic therapy such as tissue plasminogen activator should be considered first treatment when patients present with concomitant AMI and APE. However, we could not administer anti-thrombotic drugs because she had a high risk of bleeding related to pulmonary contusion after chest compressions in this case. Therefore, we decided to perform PCI because usage of intravenous heparin for underlying the catheterization can be treated with pulmonary embolism simultaneously. In addition, if the patient’s condition deteriorates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used safely in the catheterization laboratory. The administration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thrombosis and PFO closure is secondary prevention for paradoxical embolisms \\[ 3 \\]. Although theoretically it may help prevent further recurrence of paradoxical embolism, a PFO may serve to offset the elevated right atrial pressure and maintain cardiac output at the expense of low systemic saturation \\[ 8 \\]. Little evidence exists to guide the decision to close a PFO in such a situation \\[ 9 \\]. Prompt clinical diagnosis and targeted therapies adapted for the specific clinical presentation may have averted a fatal outcome.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【19】None.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】No funding was received.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】The research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【26】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【27】Informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【28】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【29】Kiyoshi Takemoto.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This favorable tumor microenvironment helps the transformed cells to undergo further mutations and clonal expansion. Case 1 was a 42-year old female with a 1-year history of a right breast fungating mass which was histologically confirmed to be matrix-producing type of MBC. Case 2 was a 47-year old female who presented with a recurrent left breast mass. Histologically, the tumor was confirmed to be carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. MBC is a rare, heterogeneous tumor with poor prognosis due to its aggressive behavior. It is more likely to mimic other benign breast conditions, therefore contributing to delay of diagnosis as it was for both of our patients herein presented.\n\n【2】metaplastic , carcinoma , breast , chondroid , poor prognosis\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Nonepithelial tumors of the breast generally are rare including benign and malignant types \\[ 1 \\]. Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) encompasses various types including those with mesenchymal-only and combined mesenchymal and epithelial components, and its prevalence is less than 1% of all breast cancers \\[ 2 \\]. The vast majority of the types of MBC are usually triple negative for ER, PR and HER-2 implying poor prognosis \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【5】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【6】### Case 1\n\n【7】A 42-year old female presented with a 1-year history of a right beast mass. The mass was fixed to the underlying tissue with ill-defined margins. Incisional biopsy was done and was reported as pleomorphic liposarcoma. Baseline chest and abdominal CT scan revealed normal lungs and intrabdominal organs. Then toilet mastectomy was done. The tumor was extensively necrotic, and it measured 14 × 9 × 11 cm. Seven lymph nodes were dissected from the axillary tail. Histologically, the tumor was composed of areas of epithelial components with almost no tubular formation ( Fig. 1A ), areas of mesenchymal and epithelial components separated by a thick fibrous strand ( Fig. 1B ) and diffuse proliferation of atypical spindle cells with marked pleomorphism and hyperchromasia ( Fig. 1C ). Increased cellularity, atypical nuclei with binucleation of the malignant chondrocytes ( Fig. 1D ) and mitotic count of 40 per 10 high power field were also seen. All the seven axillary lymph nodes and the surgical margins were free of the tumor. Pathologic TNM stage T4aN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. Immunohistochemistry staining for ER/PR and HER-2 were all negative. Cytokeratin (CK5/6) was focally positive.\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of the tumor cells with almost no tubular formation (H & E stain, ×100), ( **B** ) both epithelial (blue arrow) and mesenchymal (black arrow) areas of the tumor are shown (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic spindle tumor cells with marked hyperchromasia (H & E stain, ×200) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant chondroid matrix. There is increased cellularity, atypical nuclei and binucleation of the tumorous chondrocytes (head arrow) (H & E stain, ×400).\n\n【11】The postoperative period of the patient was uneventful. The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 months after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she remained uneventful for about 6 months, then she developed pleural effusion, wasting and generally worsening of her condition and she died after being confirmed with lung metastasis which was confirmed by chest CT scan. However, cytological analysis of the pleural fluid was not done due to the debilitating condition of the patient.\n\n【12】### Case 2\n\n【13】A 47-year old female presented with a left breast mass for more than 10 years. She reported that she had had lumpectomy done 6 months ago; unfortunately, the excised lump was not sent for histological examination. The patient started experiencing pain from the same breast followed by appearance of a mass not more than 6 weeks after lumpectomy. On physical examination, the left breast was swollen with inverted nipple and ulcerated overlying skin. Baseline CT scan survey of chest and abdomen for metastasis was normal. Radical mastectomy with dissection of three palpable axillary lymph nodes was done. Grossly, the tumor measured 10.5 × 6 × 3 cm and was extensively necrotic.\n\n【14】Histologically, the tissue sections revealed a diffuse, infiltrating tumor composed of atypical spindle cells with extensive necrosis ( Fig. 2A ). The tumor cells had marked hyperchromasia and pleomorphism ( Fig. 2B ). Brisk mitotic figures ( Fig. 2C ) and count of approximately 50 mitoses per 10 high-power field and giant tumor cells were also seen ( Fig. 2D ). The conclusion was carcinosarcomatous type of MBC. Pathologic TNM staging of pT4bN0M0 and Bloom–Richardson grade 3 were given. ER, PR and HER-2 all were negative. CK5/6 was positive in areas with carcinomatous component.\n\n【15】**Figure 2**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】( **A** ) Diffuse infiltration of atypical spindle tumor cells (H & E stain, ×40), ( **B** ) spindle tumor cells which are hyperchromatic with marked nuclear pleomorphism (H & E stain, ×100), ( **C** ) high-power magnification showing pleomorphic epithelial spindle and ovoid tumor cells and brisk mitoses (H & E stain, ×400) and ( **D** ) high-power magnification showing the malignant ovoid and spindle tumor cells with giant tumor cells (H & E stain, ×400).\n\n【18】The patient started chemoradiotherapy 2 weeks after being discharged. After she had completed the three cycles of the chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), she became stable. Three months later, chest and abdominal CT scan was done to evaluate for possible metastasis and was found to be normal. Six months post operation, the condition of the patient is stable without metastasis or local recurrence.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】MBC is histologically classified into five subtypes including spindle cell, squamous cell, matrix-producing, carcinosarcoma and osteoblastic types \\[ 2 , 4 \\]. The differential histological diagnoses of MBC include myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma and adenomyoepithelioma \\[ 2 \\]. The median age at presentation for patients with MBC ranges from 48 to 59 years \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Patients with MBC present clinically with rapidly growing masses usually greater than 2 cm, and such masses are fixed to the underlying tissue \\[ 3 \\]. Zavadil et al. reported that, over 20% of patients with MBC in their study had tumors measuring more than 3.5 cm and fixed to the underlying tissue \\[ 4 \\]. Rarely patients with MBC present with axillary lymph node metastasis, and the incidence has been reported to range from 6 to 26% \\[ 6 \\]. Studies have shown that accurate diagnosis for MBC is low. Li et al. and Zhang et al. reported that only 11.8 and 20% of the patients in their studies had accurate diagnosis before mastectomy \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【21】Surgery is the main stay of treatment of MBC. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be used based on the stage of the disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been found to decrease both the rate of recurrence and mortality rate \\[ 4 \\]. Single institution retrospective studies and genomic profiling reported that MBCs are highly chemoresistant \\[ 9 \\]. Because of being almost triple negative and at the same time chemoresistant, MBCs have very poor prognosis \\[ 10 \\]. In one study, the 5-year overall survival for MBC compared to IDC-not specified type was 67.9% and 88.9%, respectively \\[ 5 \\]. The presence of benign heterologous element, absence of intervening stroma and predominating carcinomatous component are good prognostic factors, whereas the presence of sarcomatous metaplastic elements including chondroid, osteoid and intervening spindle cells along with lymph node metastasis and tumor size are poor prognostic factors \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【22】The importance of reporting these two cases in this paper is that the two cases have shown that MBC is more likely to occur in females who are below the median age (over 50 years). Additionally, the presentation of MBC in our cases should always be considered as it was that initially, the disease was presenting as benign, which contributed to the delay of diagnosis in both cases.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】MBC carries a very poor prognosis due to its aggressive biological behavior accompanied with resistance to chemotherapy, increased chances of recurrence and metastasis.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【26】We are thankful to the radiologists and surgeons for their invaluable contribution for furnishing us with necessary information we needed in the process of writing this paper.\n\n【27】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【28】This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【29】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest to be disclosed.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】Ethical approval was provided by the Institution Review Board of the School of Biomedical Science which is under Makerere College of health Sciences.

Her first pregnancy was complicated with obstetric hemorrhage requiring hemotransfusion but delivered a healthy baby girl of 2900 grams. During her third trimester of her second pregnancy, she began with edema and varicose veins on left thigh. At 40 weeks, she developed obstetric pain and inability to ambulate. Physical examination showed prominent hypertrophy and multiple dilated varicose veins in the left limb and port wine nevus ( Fig. 1 ). Pregnancy culminated in a transvaginal delivery of a healthy male of 2940 grams. She had 400 mL bleeding during the obstetric event requiring vaginal packing gauze due to superficial mucosal bleeding. Her clinical course was uneventful. Unfortunately, venous doppler ultrasonography was not available to us at the time, and therefore pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was used empirically, after weighing the risk of increased bleeding and the risk of VTE. Nadroparin (3800 IU anti Xa) were started 12 hours post-partum and continued 10 days postdischarge.

Morbidity from KTS is related to the vascular abnormalities such as venous insufficiency, cellulitis, ulcers or thrombophlebitis. During pregnancy and puerperium, there is an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) \\[ 2 \\], thromboprophylaxis may prevent this dreadful complication. On the other hand, excessive bleeding in the intrapartum period may occur as well. There are no prospective studies evaluating thromboprophylaxis strategies during pregnancy in KTS; however, risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis in a multidisciplinary team-approach fashion is recommended to prevent VTE \\[ 3 \\]. The use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis strategies in such complex cases need further investigations, and both risks of having a significant bleeding versus thromboembolic events must be taken carefully into consideration.\n\n【6】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【7】This case is exempt from IRB approval at our institution.\n\n【8】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【9】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and is available for review upon request.\n\n【10】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【11】Mateo Porres-Aguilar, MD, FACP, CACP.\n\n【12】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【13】None.\n\n【14】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【15】The authors declare no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript.\n\n【16】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【17】The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship or publication of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

As respiratory function was severely reduced, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed showing bilateral peripheral filling of bronchiolii and alveolii with ‘tree-in-bud’ configuration combined with bilateral peribronchial and peripheral spiculated nodules. Calcified hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were also present ( Fig. 1b ).\n\n【6】The combination of these findings in a HIV patient with low CD4 count raised the suspicion of endobronchial spread in reactivated tuberculosis that was confirmed by gene expert positive in sputum.

The patient was treated with a combination of anti-tuberculous therapy and also chemotherapy for Kaposi sarcoma.

We present an unusual case of a 37-year-old male presenting with neurologic signs of right parietal lobe infarction with evidence of vertebral artery dissection and persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomosis as a conduit for thromboembolism.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Stroke in the young goes against all expectation as its occurrence is more fitting for the more aged population. Cervical artery dissection, described as the splitting of the arterial wall of the carotid or vertebral artery, accounts for up to 20% of stroke in the young \\[ 2 \\]. Vertebral artery dissections present half as many times as internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections with an annual incidence rate of 0.97 versus 1.72 per 100 000 \\[ 3 \\]. Both young and aged populations present with local symptoms of occipital headache and neck pain. However, they are exclusively different in neurological signs and symptoms with respect to the cerebral territories they supply. It is unusual for anterior circulation infarction to occur from a posterior circulation lesion, but is possible through an aberrant carotid-basilar anastomosis. As a result, the patient presents with features of vertebral artery embolism and dissection. There is only one case reported in the medical literature indicating an association with vertebral artery dissection in the presence of persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) \\[ 4 \\], but there was no associated anterior circulation infarct. We report a patient with a right parietal ischemic infarct secondary to a left vertebral artery dissection and right PPTA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old right-handed Indo-Trinidadian male was accepted into the emergency department with acute left-sided weakness with numbness of left upper limb, sudden loss of consciousness, dizziness, dysphasia and blurred vision within 2 h of the onset of these symptoms. The patient had no medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart disease, immunocompromised states, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders or illicit drug use. Family history is positive for myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus. The history of most recent event was one of being seated at rest when there was a sudden onset of the presenting symptoms. There was no violent coughing nor sneezing, chiropractic activity, no trauma to the cervical spine nor falls.\n\n【6】He was conscious with no hemodynamic instability including systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats/min and temperature of 36.4°C. Neurological assessment revealed dysarthria, left-sided hemiparesis, loss of two-point discrimination in left upper extremity and right-sided facial paralysis. Review of other systems demonstrated no clinical significance. Laboratory findings on presentation included HbA1c 5.1%, fasting glucose 95 mg/dL, cholesterol 188 mg/dL (desirable < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides 110 mg/dL (normal < 150 mg/dL), High-Density Lipoprotein 31 mg/dL (40–60 mg/dL), Low-Density Lipoprotein 102 (<100 mg/dL), Cholesterol 135 mg/dL (50–160 mg/dL), Very Low-Density Lipoprotein 22 mg/dL (0–38 mg/dL), risk ratio 6.1(low 3.0, average 5.0, high 13.0). Coagulation screen: partial thromboplastin time 30.1 (control 30.1 s), prothrombin time 11.1 (control 11.6), International Normalized Ratio 0.95. Cardiac triage: creatine kinase-MB 10.00 (0.00–16.00 U/L), troponin T < 50 ng/L (acute myocardial infarction NOT LIKELY). Myoglobin 32.0 (16–76 ng/ml). Autoimmune screen: cardiolipin Ig (immunoglobulin) A 4.78 (negative < 15APL, cardiolipin IgG 2.31 (< 10 GPL), cardiolipin IgM 1.32 (negative < 15 MPL), ANA IgG 0.05 (<0.9 no detectable ANA IgG by ELISA). Hematology: platelets 256 (150–410 ×103/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), hemoglobin 15.3 (13–17 g/dL), hematocrit 45 (40–50%), low mean corpuscular volume 79 (83–101 fl). Factor V Leiden 2.57 (ratio 2.18–3.38), fibrinogen 4.09 (3.08–6.13 g/L), lupus anticoagulant screen 1.52 (ratio positive > 1.2. C-reactive protein < 5.0 (<10 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 10 (male, 17–50 years ≤ 10 mm/h), protein C 123 (70.0–140.0% activity), elevated protein S 155 (63.0–135.0% activity), antithrombin III 96 (83–128% activity). Biochemistry: creatinine 0.81 (0.66–1.25 mg/dL), serum sodium 145 (135–148 mmol/L), serum potassium (3.8–5.2 mmol/L), mildly elevated serum chloride 110 (95–106 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen 15 (9.0–20.0 mg/dL). D-dimer 0.26 (<0.5 ug/ml), liver profile: elevated globulin 3.7 (2.3–3.5 g/dL). Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography was negative for valvular pathology or thrombus, no pericardial effusion with normal left ventricular wall motion (ejection fraction Simpson: 60%). Also, on presentation at the emergency department, a contrast computerized tomography (CT) of the head and neck showed a right vertebral artery arising from the right subclavian artery, but is small in caliber and does not fully opacify and dissection flap within the right vertebral artery. The left vertebral and common and internal carotid arteries are normal in caliber. A PPTA is present on the right side without associated cerebral aneurysm or vascular malformations noted. The aortic arch is normal in outline. A cerebral axial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed also at the time of presentation to the emergency department demonstrated an area of hyperintensity in the right parietal lobe adjacent to the Sylvian fissure (right middle cerebral artery territory) consistent with clinical findings, a right PPTA and diffuse narrowing of visualized part of the right vertebral artery, possibly hypoplastic ( Fig. 1 ). A 3D time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF MRA) on 1.5 Tesla demonstrated crescent sign in left vertebral artery indicating dissection ( Fig. 2A ), and PPTA between right ICA and distal basilar artery with normal diameter of both ICAs ( Fig. 3 ). The patient was anti-coagulated with intravenous heparin \\[10\\], which resulted in rapid but incomplete resolution of symptoms. This initial anticoagulation was coupled with oral antiplatelet therapy, using aspirin and clopidogrel for the purpose of long-term administration. On follow-up, a repeat contrast MRI 10 days later demonstrated a hypoplastic right vertebral artery. In addition, a color duplex ultrasonogram of vertebral arteries demonstrated a flow-dependent flap seen on cardiac cycling along the intra-foraminal left vertebral artery. Clinically, at this 1-week post-presentation, he was with full recovery of motor and sensory function on the left side with a subjective assessment of mildly slurred speech. Subsequent follow-up detailed occasional mild neck pains of no subjective concerns regarding occupational hazards. Efforts have been made to review the progress of this patient, but he has been unable to present to the outpatient clinic for even further follow-up.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Axial DWI MRI showing hyperintensity in right parietal lobe adjacent to sylvian fissure.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】( **A** ) axial 3D-TOF MRI showing ‘crescent sign’ or dissection of left vertebral artery.

However, the causes are not always well-defined. In contrast to stroke in the elderly, causes are different and rare including illicit drug use, patent foramen ovale, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and cervical artery dissection. Cervical artery dissections are the most common cause of stroke in the young with vertebral artery dissections accounting for half as many as ICA dissections. Vertebral artery dissections are usually due to extrinsic factors such as trauma, whiplash accidents in motor vehicular accidents, direct hit, medical procedures and strangulation. Numerous reports have described rare etiologies including minor injuries from coughing, vomiting, violent sneezing, sports, roller coaster rides or chiropractic manipulation. Spontaneous dissections are also reported in those with underlying arteriopathy, such as connective tissue diseases or fibromuscular dysplasia. Due its low incidence rate, however, this may very well be also attributed to presumed minor injuries.\n\n【18】Vertebral artery dissections typically present with occipital headache, neck pain or vertigo, with some experiencing ischemic manifestations such as posterior circulation syndromes including lateral medullary syndrome—dysphagia, dizziness, vertigo, Horner’s syndrome, nystagmus. However, due to the presentation of anterior circulation infarct in this patient, cervical artery dissection as an etiology seems highly unlikely. However, in this patient, there was no clear evidence to support a hematological, inflammatory, traumatic, nor metabolic cause via the anterior circulation. After ruling out other causes of stroke in the young, imaging also revealed a PPTA that anastomoses the distal basilic artery to the right ICA. This anastomosis provides a potential conduit for emboli from the vertebral artery dissection resulting in an anterior circulation stroke instead of a typical posterior circulation stroke.\n\n【19】PPTA is the most common and largest of the primitive carotid-basilar anastomoses that persist into adulthood with a prevalence of 0.1% and 0.68% \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Other persistent primitive anastomoses include the primitive otic (acoustic) artery, the primitive hypoglossal artery and the primitive proatlantal artery. There have been infrequent reports cases of these anastomoses implicated in multi-territorial infarcts attributed to their role as conduits \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【20】To the best of our experience, this is the first report of vertebral artery dissection and anterior circulation stroke secondary to embolism through PPTA.\n\n【21】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【22】All individuals in this report have made exceptional contributions.\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【24】None applicable.\n\n【25】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【26】No acknowledgment for funding has been identified.\n\n【27】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【28】None required in this instance.\n\n【29】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【30】Received and available if requested.\n\n【31】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【32】Dr Dale A.

However, dermatomal temperature and pain sensory loss have rarely been reported in patients with LMI. We describe the case of a patient with LMI presenting solely with temperature and pain sensory disorder below the C5 sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging findings demonstrated a small superficial infarction in the right lateral medulla oblongata, indicating that the sensory deficit was caused by a restricted infarction of the lateral spinothalamic tract. We emphasize the importance of adding LMI to a differential diagnosis of acute dermatomal sensory disturbance without other major symptoms of LMI, such as cranial nerve abnormalities, ataxia and Horner’s syndrome.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Lateral medullary infarct (LMI), also known as Wallenberg syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome, is the most prevalent brainstem infarction in clinical practice \\[ 1 \\]. It is caused by the obstruction or dissection of the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the brainstem \\[ 2 \\]. LMI characteristically involves the inferior cerebellar peduncle, lateral spinothalamic tract, trigeminal spinal cord nucleus, solitary nucleus, nucleus ambiguous and descending sympathetic tract fibres. Neurological symptoms characteristically include sensory disturbances (89%), dysarthria (75%), vertigo or nausea (73%), Horner’s syndrome (72%), cerebellar ataxia (69%), dysphagia (57%) and hiccups (15%) \\[ 3 \\]. As the nuclei and tracts are densely located within the lateral medulla oblongata, sensory disturbances are often accompanied by other neurological symptoms. However, pure sensory deficits caused by LMI are uncommon \\[ 4 \\]. Moreover, isolated dermatomal dissociated sensory deficit mimicking spinal cord lesions have rarely been reported. Here, we report the case of a patient with caudal LMI presenting solely with temperature and pain sensory loss distributed along the dermatome.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 58-year-old woman presented with acute loss of temperature and pain sensation in the left side of her body and in the left limbs following cervical pain. She visited our hospital 3 days after symptom onset. Her medical history included asthma, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Her daily medications were prednisolone (3 mg), alfacalcidol (0.5 μg), rupatadine fumarate (10 mg) and rosuvastatin calcium (2.5 mg). On physical examination, she was alert, well-oriented and afebrile with a blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg. She had lost temperature and pain sensation below the left C5 sensory level ( Fig. 1A ), while her sensations of touch, position and vibration were intact. She showed no symptoms of any cranial nerve abnormalities, muscle weakness, abnormal tendon reflexes, ataxia, Horner’s syndrome or facial sensory loss. Her neurological symptoms were checked by two certificated neurologists.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Schematic presentation of pain and temperature sensation disorder ( **A** ).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed high-intensity signals in the right caudal lateral medulla oblongata on diffusion-weighted imaging ( Fig. 1B and C ), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( Fig. 1D ) and an enlarged right vertical artery ( Fig. 1E ). The MRI findings of the cervical spinal cord were normal. Consequently, we diagnosed her with LMI, suspecting right vertebral artery dissection as the aetiological cause. Therefore, we initiated clopidogrel administration (75 mg/day). Her sensory responses gradually improved from the left upper extremity on hospitalization day 3. Then, on hospitalization day 8, her sensory responses of the left lower extremity showed improvement. On hospitalization day 10, she was discharged to her home without any symptoms. At her 1-month follow-up examination, her neurological symptoms had improved substantially without stroke recurrence.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】Sensory disturbance is the most common manifestation of LMI and occurs in 89% of cases \\[ 3 \\]. It is well known that the typical features of sensory disturbance are temperature and pain impairment on the ipsilateral face as well as contralateral limbs/body because LMI affects the ascending lateral spinothalamic tract and trigeminal spiral tract. However, the characteristics of sensory disturbance because of LMI may vary according to its size. With the recent advances in MRI, various patterns of sensory dysfunction have been reported in LMI cases \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Kim _et al_ . \\[ 6 \\] reported the characteristics of sensory disturbance due to LMI in their case series of 50 consecutive patients. Their respective frequencies were as follows: ipsilateral face and contralateral limb/body disturbances (26%); contralateral face, trunk and limb disturbances (25%); limb/body involvement without trigeminal involvement (21%); bilateral trigeminal-contralateral limb/body disturbances (14%) and trigeminal involvement without limb/body involvement (10%).\n\n【12】Sensory disturbances are often accompanied by other neurological symptoms \\[ 3 , 5 \\] However, temperature and pain sensory loss on the contralateral trunk distributed along the dermatome without ipsilateral facial sensory loss have poorly been reported.\n\n【13】In this case, the MRI findings revealed a small lesion in the right superficial caudal lateral medullary oblongata ( Fig. 1B–E ). We speculate that the sensory deficit in this case was related to the somatotopic organization of the lateral spinothalamic tract. The lateral spinothalamic tract is an ascending sensory pathway composed of afferent nerve fibres that carry information regarding pain and temperature in the corresponding limb and trunk. In the spinal cord and brainstem, the ascending sensory nerve fibres from the sacral, lumbar, thoracic and cervical components are arranged from the lateral to the medial direction ( Fig. 1F ) \\[ 7 \\]. Based on her physical symptoms and MRI findings, the lateral infarction restricted to the lateral spinothalamic tract resulted in sensory deficits below the C5 sensory level ( Fig. 1F ).\n\n【14】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【15】Herein, we report a rare case of a small LMI confined to the lateral spinothalamic tract that subsequently developed into isolated dermatomal sensory loss. Clinicians should consider that LMI may vary in size and clinical symptoms; furthermore, the absence of cranial nerve palsy, ataxia or Horner’s syndrome does not rule out LMI.\n\n【16】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【17】We are grateful to our patient for giving us permission to write up her case.

A life-threatening and potentially fatal manifestation of thyrotoxicosis is thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is considered rare with an occurrence rate of 1–2% of all patients with hyperthyroidism, making a high index of suspicion important in the early recognition of this debilitating complication. We present the case of a 63-year-old female with a significant history of being non-compliant with her hyperthyroidism regimen and presented to the emergency department in severe respiratory distress. She was ultimately diagnosed with thyroid storm induced high-output congestive heart failure, intubated, had a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the intensive care unit in a guarded condition. Her hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged on Day 12.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】The most common underlying etiology of a thyroid storm is Grave’s disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyrotropin receptor antibodies. As an endocrine emergency and sepsis mimic, thyroid storm becomes a must recognize disease process, with an untreated mortality of 100% and 10–50% with treatment \\[ 1 \\]. The clinical presentation of thyroid storm is diverse, presents within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis and requires a multifactorial treatment regimen. As a severe hypermetabolic condition, thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician.\n\n【4】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) in severe respiratory distress. She stated, ‘I had asthma as a kid, this kind of feels like that.’ Symptoms started abruptly 2 days ago while she was leaving her house to go shopping and continued to progressively get worse. Associated symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic chest pain, diaphoresis and lightheadedness. She denied any recent travel, hormone replacement, prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, calf pain/leg pain or any other symptoms. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure 220/114 mmHg, respiratory rate up to 42 breaths/min, heart rate of 124 beats/min and a pulse ox of 88% on a non-rebreather. Physical exam was notable for severe respiratory distress and diaphoresis with conversational dyspnea, intercostal retractions and supraclavicular retractions. The patient was not wanting to talk or move secondary to the shortness of breath. Examination of the head and neck revealed no evidence for proptosis; however, she did exhibit fullness to her thyroid bilaterally. Her cardiopulmonary exam revealed diffuse rales in all lung fields and no obvious murmur. Her lower extremities were significant for 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure on arrival, a high dose nitroglycerine infusion was started and furosemide was given. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus tachycardia at 119 with biatrial enlargement. Chest radiography, Fig. 1 , shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Chest radiography shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n【9】Blood pressure improved to 170/70 mmHg, and the patient was able to communicate regarding her medical history. She noted intermittent palpitations for over 1 year, decreased appetite, an unintentional 10-lb weight loss and blurry vision. Chart review revealed that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level performed as an outpatient 2 months prior returning a value of <0.01. At that time, a thyroid ultrasound was performed and was concerning for a solid right thyroid nodule measuring up to 1.8 cm. A subsequent technetium thyroid study revealed a goiter with increased technetium trapping consistent with the clinical suspicion of Graves’ disease. The patient had refused radioiodine therapy. She was prescribed methimazole and propranolol as an outpatient, but missed multiple doses frequently.\n\n【10】Within 5 minutes of arrival, she began to decompensate, with increasing diaphoresis, tachypnea, hypoxia, bradycardia and lethargy. Decision was thus made to intubate utilizing etomidate and rocuronium. Subsequent chest radiography post intubation, Fig. 2 , shows a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. Approximately 4 minutes later, her rhythm went from bradycardic into asystole. Advanced cardiac life support protocol was followed, with a resulting return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 5 minutes. Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion or right heart strain. CT angiography of the chest, Figs 3 and 4 , shows no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Chest radiography post intubation showing a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.\n\n【14】**Figure 3**\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【17】**Figure 4**\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【20】Laboratory evaluation was notable for a TSH <0.01 (0.40–4.50 mcIU/ml), free T3 of 10.2 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml), free T4 of 2.7 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL), brain natriuretic peptide of 566 (0–100 pg/ml), troponin of 0.01/0.12/0.24 (0.00–0.04 ng/ml) and blood glucose of 210. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 89, p02 345, HCO3 23. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable. No other acute lab abnormalities were found.\n\n【21】The case was discussed with endocrinology and she was started on the following regimen: propranolol 1 mg IV followed by 60 mg PO every 6 hours via her nasogastric tube, methimazole 20 mg loading dose followed by 20 mg every 6 hours, SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral Solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours, hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours and cholestyramine powder 4 gm via NG tube q6 hours. The patient was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition for suspected high output congestive heart failure secondary to thyroid storm from a non-compliance with her hyperthyroidism treatment. The elevated troponin was deemed likely a type II mechanism related to hypoxia, bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【22】By Day 2, the patient was alert on the ventilator, answering yes or no questions and doing well on spontaneous breathing trials. A formal 2D echocardiography showed mild eccentric mitral regurgitation, trace pulmonic insufficiency, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. By Day 5, she was transferred out of the ICU. By Day 7, her free T3 was approaching normal at 2.1 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml) and her free T4 normalized at 2.4 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL). It will take several weeks for the TSH to return to normal. Her remaining hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on Day 12. She later underwent radioactive iodine ablation as an outpatient. There will likely be a need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy once the patient develops an underactive thyroid. At her most recent endocrinology follow-up appointment, she remains compliant, has had a full return to baseline activities and enjoys spending time with her family.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Thyroid storm is a severe hypermetabolic condition resulting in increased sensitivity and expression of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to a higher response to endogenous catecholamines \\[ 2 \\]. There are number of causes, including, but not limited to the following: medical non-compliance, untreated thyroid disease, trauma, myocardial ischemia, infection, overdose of thyroid hormone and diabetic ketoacidosis \\[ 2 \\]. In our patient, her thyroid storm was secondary to medical non-compliance with her hyperthyroid medication and non-compliance with the recommended radioactive iodine treatment.\n\n【25】For the emergency physician, laboratory evaluation will reveal a TSH that is usually low or undetectable with an associated elevated T3 and T4. Other laboratory findings can include anemia, lower serum creatinine, hypercalcemia or thrombocytopenia. If adrenal insufficiency is also present, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyponatremia \\[ 2 \\]. The clinical presentation is extremely diverse, with similarities to a hyperadrenergic state, with multiple systems being affected.\n\n【26】*   Central nervous system manifestations (altered mental status, seizures, agitation, lethargy, psychosis and coma)\n    \n*   Cardiovascular manifestations (sinus tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chest pain, wide pulse-pressure and dyspnea on exertion)\n    \n*   Gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea)\n    \n*   Skin manifestations (flushed, warm, moist and possible vitiligo and hyperpigmentation)\n    \n*   Thyroid gland manifestations (diffuse enlargement, neck fullness and thyroid tenderness)\n    \n\n【27】As the disease process progresses, excess amounts of thyroid hormone begin to have a significant impact on cardiovascular hemodynamics. The result is high-output congestive heart failure (an uncommon type of heart failure) as the cardiac tissue has an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. Characteristic features of a high-output congestive heart failure include an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. In this particular form of heart failure, the increased cardiac output is greater than the metabolic demand. Patients will present with an increased stroke volume, increased myocardial contractility, increased ejection fraction, atrial arrhythmia and systolic hypertension with an associated wide pulse pressure \\[ 5 \\]. If left untreated, the result is eventual dilated cardiomyopathy, lethal dysrhythmias and death \\[ 5 \\]. This concept of high-output congestive heart failure is counterintuitive to the typical congestive heart failure secondary to other causes, such as a myocardial infarction, that results in decreased myocardial contractility, low cardiac output and ventricular arrhythmia \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【28】Being within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis, distinguishing severe thyrotoxicosis from thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician. One set of diagnostic criteria that can be used to aid in diagnosing thyroid storm is the Burch-Wartofsky Scale \\[ 2 \\]. Components include the degree of fever, tachycardia, presence of atrial fibrillation, presence of congestive heart failure, any gastrointestinal dysfunction and any central nervous system dysfunction \\[ 2 \\]. A score greater than 45 points is diagnostic of thyroid storm, 25–44 points is associated with an impending thyroid storm and <25 points is unlikely. Our patient received 10 points for a fever of 101.2°F, 15 points for a heart rate of 124 beats/min, 20 points for congestive heart failure and 10 points for agitation, for a total score of 55 points. Another diagnostic aid that can be utilized in diagnosing thyroid storm are the criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association (presence of thyrotoxicosis in addition to at least one central nervous system dysfunction in combination with fever, CHF, tachycardia or gastrointestinal abnormality) \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【29】Treatment is multifactorial and involves a specific order to the treatment regimen as outlined below.\n\n【30】1.  Beta blocker is used to block the peripheral effects of the thyroid hormones and prevent the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is used for this reason to treat the systemic effects (starting dose is often 1 mg IV push, titrating 1–3 mg q10 minutes and PO formulations dosed at 60–80 mg q6 hours) \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. In our patient, she received 1 mg IV of propranolol and started on a PO formulation.\n    \n2.  Administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole is utilized to inhibit the _de novo_ synthesis of T3 and T4. PTU is typically given as a 600–1000 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg q6. Methimazole is typically given as a 20–30 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 20–30 mg q6 \\[ 2 \\].\n    \n3.  Administration of SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours or Lugol’s solution 4–8 gtts q6 hours \\[ 2 \\]. These will block the release of pre-formed thyroid hormones.\n    \n4.  Administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours or Dexamethasone 2–4 mg q6 hours) as thyroid storm causes depression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis. In addition, corticosteroids have the ability inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n    \n5.  Administration of cholestyramine powder (4 g PO q6 hours) aids in reducing thyroid hormone levels by interfering with anterior hepatic circulation and recycling of thyroid hormones \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n    \n\n【31】Definitive treatment often post-hospitalization involves surgery or radioactive iodine, as our patient had received. The Journal of Clinical Apheresis published an article in 2018 regarding patients that cannot undergo thyroidectomy or fail pharmacotherapy. In these patients, plasma exchange has been suggested as another treatment option; however, the optimal role is not established and there are only a limited number of cases within the medical literature \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【32】To decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with thyroid storm, an emergency medicine physician must consider this diagnosis in any patient presenting to the ED in a hypermetabolic state \\[ 5 \\]. The most common cause of death in thyroid storm is cardiopulmonary failure \\[ 4 \\]. As a result, quick recognition and treatment is critical for patient survival.\n\n【33】Conflict of interest\n--------------------\n\n【34】None declared.\n\n【35】Funding\n-------\n\n【36】No financial support was received for this study.\n\n【37】Ethical Approval\n----------------\n\n【38】No approval is required.\n\n【39】Consent\n-------\n\n【40】Informed patient consent was obtained.\n\n【41】Guarantor\n---------\n\n【42】G.T. is the guarantor of this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

She appeared pale, and her blood pressure was 60/31 mmHg; heart rate, 150 beats/min and oxygen saturation, 74% on room air. Physical examination revealed jugular venous distension and wheezes in both lungs. The admission electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed features of cardiac tamponade and compression of the heart by a large high-echoic mass. Respiratory status improved promptly with oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but cardiogenic shock did not improve sufficiently with extracellular fluid and noradrenaline administration. Computed tomography showed a large hiatal hernia with migration of the stomach into the mediastinum compressing the heart from the dorsal side ( Fig. 1 , Panel A). After decompression of the stomach via a nasogastric tube, she immediately recovered from cardiogenic shock ( Fig. 1 , Panel B).

Major salivary glands are mainly involved, and there is very low reported incidence of such tumor in minor salivary glands of nasal cavity. We report a case of 69-year-old woman who complaint of chronic left nasal obstruction and recurrent scanty bleeding from left nostril for last 2 months. On anterior Rhinoscopy examination, there was a pinkish non-tender mass in left nasal cavity arising from cartilaginous part of nasal septum. Intranasal endoscopic excision was done under general anesthesia and histopathological examination of excised tissue revealed pleomorphic adenoma. Patient was discharged after 3 days. There was no recurrence at sixth month of follow-up.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the commonest benign salivary gland tumor, which can occur at any locations wherever salivary gland tissue is found. It mostly involves the major salivary glands with highest incidence in the parotid gland \\[ 1 \\]. The minor salivary glands involvement is only about 8%, which includes the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, hypopharynx, pharynx, larynx, trachea and lacrimal glands \\[ 1 \\]. And among them, only 0.4% incidence in the nasal cavity has been reported \\[ 2 \\]. These tumors have their peak incidence in third-sixth decade and have been observed more in females \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【4】PA in nasal cavity are often misidentified because of their high cellularity and less stromal component, contrast to those found elsewhere \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. They are slow growing rare tumor, which are liable to recur even after complete excision \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】We report a case of a 69-year-old Nepalese woman who presented to outpatient department of Otorhinolaryngology with complaint of chronic left nasal obstruction and occasional recurrent scanty bleeding from left nostril for the last 2 months. There was no history of excessive sneezing, nose trauma, prior surgery, weight loss, fever or facial pain. She was non-smoker, did not drink alcohol and denied any history of substance abuse. On anterior Rhinoscopy examination, there was pinkish polypoidal, non-tender nasal mass in the left nasal cavity. The probe could be passed around the mass except in its medial aspect, where it was attached to the septum. Mild bleeding on probing was seen. Neck lymph nodes were impalpable. All cranial nerve examination was also normal.\n\n【7】With clinical diagnosis of bleeding granuloma endoscopic excisional biopsy was done under general anesthesia. Smooth, rounded, firm, polypoidal bleeding mass of about 3 × 3 cm <sup>2 </sup> arising from cartilaginous part of nasal septum of left nostril was excised and sent for histopathological examination ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】(A) Pleomorphic adenoma in left nasal septum (black arrow); left middle turbinate (blue arrow). (B) Gross picture of excised mass from left nasal septum.\n\n【11】Microscopy revealed a well-circumscribed cellular tumor comprising both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. The tumor cells were arranged predominantly in sheets, focally in tubules and trabeculae with an overlying intact respiratory lining epithelium ( Fig. 2A and B ). The tumor cells lining the tubules in the abluminal layer exhibit myoepithelial differentiation with plasmacytoid, spindled as well as epithelioid morphology and were relatively monomorphic. Most of these tubules contain eosinophilic acellular secretions in their lumen. Multiple areas of myxoid matrix are identified with the myoepithelial cells seen to be melting in the myxoid stroma ( Fig. 2C ). Focal areas showed tumor cells arranged in cribriform pattern. Some areas of abrupt squamous differentiation and sebaceous differentiation were also identified ( Fig. 2D and A). Morphological features were consistent with cellular pleomorphic adenoma.\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Histology section using hematoxylin and eosin staining.

There was no sign of recurrence at sixth month of follow-up.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Intranasal PA, a rare finding, was first reported back in 1929 \\[ 6 \\]. Though unusual, 40 case studies of nasal cavity PA by Compagno and Wong (1997) and 59 cases by Wakami (1996) have been reported \\[ 6 \\]. Literature review of 101 cases of sinonasal PA by Rha et al. (2018) showed the incidence more common in females. Most common site of origin of nasal PA was septum (57.42%) with one-sided nasal blockage as the most common presenting symptom followed by epistaxis, mass in the nose, external swelling, epiphora and mucopurulent rhinorrhea \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【18】Diagnosis of nasal cavity PA is confirmed by histopathological examination. Histologically, PA comprises of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in stromal matrix. However, in PA of nasal cavity, myoepithelial cellularity is unusually increased, which makes diagnosis difficult sometimes as revealed by Compagno and Wong \\[ 3 \\] as well as Shih-Hung \\[ 4 \\]. A misdiagnosed case of nasal PA as adenoid cystic carcinoma was reported by Haberman and Stanely (1989) \\[ 8 \\]. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging helps in locating the tumor rather than diagnosing.\n\n【19】Although benign, it can have local recurrences. The mesenchymal component myxoid stroma could be locus for future recurrence if it gets spilled into the surgical field \\[ 9 \\]. Occasionally, it can behave like malignant tumor. About, 2.5–10% malignant change over rate with female majority was reported by Compango et al. reported \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【20】Wide local resection with histological clear margin is generally performed for intranasal pleomorphic adenoma to reduce the rate of recurrence \\[ 1 \\]. Different surgical approaches like intranasal endoscopic, transnasal endoscopic, lateral rhinotomy, external rhinoplasty and mid-facial degloving can be used \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【21】In conclusion, nasal PA is not only rare tumor, but also difficult to diagnose. PA has high myoepithelial cellularity with less stromal matrix. In case of chronic unilateral nasal blockage due to mass, PA should be considered as a differential diagnosis. The recurrences of PA over a duration of 7–25 years after primary surgery have been reported \\[ 10 \\]. Thus, long-term follow-up is necessary as it gives an idea of extent of recurrence, if any, or malignant change over as well as the feasibility of treatment.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【23】We would like to acknowledge ENT department staffs who participated in the care of this case.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】No ethical approval was needed for this case report.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】The authors obtained written informed consent from the patient for this publication.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Dr. Gyan Raj Aryal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Current British Society of Rheumatology advice is to stop TCZ 3-months pre-conception. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with extensive TA treated with TCZ, azathioprine and glucocorticoids in pregnancy. She was closely monitored with MDT input and TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy as the benefits were thought to outweigh the risks. Our case also highlights the importance of accurate blood pressure monitoring in an appropriate anatomical location, given the extent of her disease. Our patient’s disease remained stable throughout the antenatal and post-partum period with a successful pregnancy outcome and no maternal or foetal complications. TCZ is suitable for select cases of refractory TA during pregnancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) is a large vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology. Glucocorticoid therapy is a mainstay of treatment. More recently, tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, has been approved in resistant or refractory disease \\[ 1 \\]. Because of the limited data in pregnancy, current British Society of Rheumatology guidance is to stop TCZ 3 months prior to conception \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】### CASE REPORT\n\n【5】We report a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian lady (Gravida 2, Para 1) with TA treated with TCZ throughout pregnancy at a tertiary specialist Foetal and Maternal Medicine—Rheumatology combined clinic.\n\n【6】The patient gave a 4-year history of daily headache with photophobia diagnosed previously as migraine. In January 2017, she presented with 3 days of malaise with typical headache and right sided upper limb aching with incoordination. The following day she presented with repeated 10-min episodes of left facial and upper limb weakness and word-finding difficulties. She was reviewed by neurology team and her workup suggested a right carotid territory dissection with parietal cortex involvement on MR imaging; however, MR angiography revealed widespread large vessel vasculitis with proximal right brachiocephalic, right common carotid artery, left carotid artery origin and left Subclavian involvement ( Fig. 1 , Image 1). Given the findings she was diagnosed with TA.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Comparison of the MR angiographic findings between January 2017 (Image 1) and December 2018 (Image 2). The arteries are labelled numerically as follows: brachiocephalic artery (1), initially stenosed, subsequently progressed with occlusion from aortic arch to the vertebral artery origin. Right common carotid artery (2) was severely narrowed with only a trickle flow proximally and occluded up to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the right internal carotid artery (3) is severely narrowed initially and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan. Right vertebral artery (4) was initially severely attenuated, with only a trickle flow, and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan and appeared almost normal. Left common carotid artery (5) was initially severely narrowed over a short segment from the aortic arch origin becomes occluded from the arch to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the left internal carotid artery (6), initially normal, subsequently shows moderately severe narrowing in the neck. The left subclavian artery has a short segment of severe stenosis, which had progressed slightly, whereas the distal subclavian artery narrowing in the supraclavicular fossa had resolved. Left vertebral artery (8) is dominant and was not affected initially, and becomes hypertrophic on subsequent scan.\n\n【10】Initial treatment was with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1 gram and IV cyclophosphamide. IV methylprednisolone was given for 5 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisolone. The inflammatory markers improved but had not normalized. Following the seventh course of cyclophosphamide, she had a left middle cerebral artery embolic event in late 2017. Angiogram showed progression of the disease in the major arteries of the neck ( Fig. 1 , Image 2). Because of refractory disease, her treatment was changed to subcutaneous TCZ (162 mg weekly), azathioprine and a weaning dose of prednisolone (25 mg). Azathioprine was started at 50 mg daily and escalated to 100 mg. She conceived on this combination and was assessed first time in our combined Rheumatology/Obstetrics clinic at 14 weeks gestation (March 2019). She had no other co-morbidities and was a non-smoker. Baseline blood pressure (BP) in her thigh was 130/84 mmHg and 90/68 and 67/53 mmHg in her left and right arms, respectively. Her Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS) at first pregnancy visit was 0 (scored retrospectively by INB) \\[ 3 \\] and her CRP was 5 mg/l (normal < 5.0). Given her extensive disease and previous life-threatening complications and following detailed discussion with the patient and her partner, a decision to continue TCZ was made, with close monitoring and multi-disciplinary support. A steroid-taper of 5 mg every 4 weeks was initiated, and she was started on aspirin 150 mg at night and tinzaparin 4500 IU daily.\n\n【11】BP monitoring used her thigh or calf and at 22 weeks, amlodipine 5 mg daily was added as her BP was 170/70 mmHg. Ultrasound assessments of placental function were performed at 17 and 22 weeks. There was normal foetal growth and both uterine artery dopplers demonstrated normal resistance waveforms. Because of risk of pre-eclampsia urine protein ratio was check at each clinic visit and this remained within normal range (0–30 mg/mmol).\n\n【12】Prednisolone was further tapered to 7.5 mg daily by 34 weeks and maintained through the rest of her pregnancy. Systemically, she had no TA flares; at her 34-week visit her ITAS score remained 0 and her CRP was <1.0 mg/L. There were concerns over the risks of vaginal delivery, and an elective caesarean section (CS) was planned at 39 weeks gestation. However, spontaneous labour occurred 2 days before her scheduled admission date and she had an emergency CS. She delivered a baby girl weighing 2768 grams with no peri-partum maternal or foetal complications. TCZ and azathioprine were withheld during the peri-partum period for 2–3 weeks until her CS wound healed and she had IV hydrocortisone 25 mg three times daily for 48 h and then prednisolone was continued at 7.5 mg daily.\n\n【13】Few months later (2020), she underwent MRA brain and carotid to assess disease status. Imaging was discussed at neuroradiology multidisciplinary team meeting; the stenotic lesion remained stable and there were no radiographic features to suggest disease progression.\n\n【14】Subsequently she has been maintained on TCZ and AZA and her prednisolone was tapered to 5 and 7.5 mg alternate days. More recent imaging (2022) confirms disease stability. At the time of reporting, her baby is 40 months old and is healthy.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Relapsing, resistant TA poses significant challenges during pregnancy. Whilst biologics are discontinued prior to pregnancy or early in the first trimester; uncontrolled or flaring disease can put both the mother and foetus at risk of complications such as worsening hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity and/or intra-uterine growth restriction \\[ 4 \\]. High-dose glucocorticoids also contribute to BP dysregulation and impaired glucose tolerance, thus adding to overall pregnancy risks.\n\n【17】TCZ provides good disease control and is steroid sparing. No relevant placental transfer of IgG1 occurs in the first trimester; however, transfer can increasingly occur through the second and third trimesters \\[ 4 \\]. Current guidelines suggest stopping TCZ 3 months prior to conception \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【18】Data regarding TCZ safety in pregnancy are mainly from RA patients. One case series of prenatal or early first trimester exposure to TCZ found that in 180 prospective and 108 retrospective cases there was no substantial increase in the rate of congenital malformations \\[ 5 \\]. The rate of spontaneous abortion (21%) was similar to the general population (10–20%) \\[ 6 \\]. A retrospective analysis of 61 Japanese RA patients on TCZ found that the rate of spontaneous abortion (18%), congenital abnormalities (none) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (10%) were similar to the general population \\[ 7 \\]. In this study, only one patient continued TCZ throughout pregnancy and delivered a baby with a low birth weight (<2000 g).\n\n【19】We found two cases of patients taking TCZ in pregnancy for TA \\[ 4 , 8 \\]. As with our case, both had refractory disease with extensive damage. TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy in one patient and stopped at 6 weeks gestation in the other. Pregnancy outcomes were favourable apart from one case developing neonatal jaundice \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【20】More recently TCZ has been widely used for the management of severe COVID-19 \\[ 9 \\]. Ten pregnant patients were included in trial; however, no specific maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted. In another retrospective study of 12 pregnant women with COVID-19 receiving TCZ, all pregnancies resulted in live births, there were two reports of transient hepatotoxicity and one of cytomegalovirus \\[ 9 \\]. To gain further understanding and effect of immunomodulators on pregnancy and neonatal outcome, a more robust regulatory structure for recruiting pregnant patient in clinical trial is warranted.\n\n【21】Our case had aggressive TA and since the benefits of continuing TCZ to maintain stable disease outweighed the theoretical risks, TCZ was continued through pregnancy with a successful outcome. This case also highlights the need for accurate monitoring BP in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. In selected cases, TCZ therefore has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy.\n\n【22】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【23】In selected cases, TCZ has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy. It is pertinent to monitor BP accurately in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. Our case report also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary team role in managing such complex cases.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】No approval required.\n\n【28】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

On examination, pallor was found to be present. Then ultrasonography of abdomen was done and it showed mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Sputum for acid-fast Bacilli was examined and found to be negative but despite this, based on the epidemiological data, antitubercular therapy (ATT) was started but after 2 weeks no clinical improvement was found. Then, fine-needle aspiration cytology of lymph node was done and it resulted in the presence of cryptococcal lymphadenitis as the final report. Antifungal therapy was initiated with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole and there was clinical improvement. Ultrasonographical findings also supported it. Though it is a rare case (but not impossible) that cryptococcus is the cause of lymphadenopathy. Thus, in initial presentation of acquired immuno deficiency syndrome it should always be kept in mind that such cases may happen. In India, presuming _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ as the leading cause exposes the patient to unwanted hepatic and renal toxicity of ATT.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has varied presentation of which, lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation at any stage of the disease due to different underlying causes \\[ 1 \\]. Most common of them being the opportunistic infections and malignancy \\[ 2 \\]. India is a tubercular endemic country. It gives a good tilt to assume tuberculosis as the most common cause of lymphadenopathy in HIV-infected patients. This background confuses the treating physician in some of the cases. Thus, broadening the thought spectrum we present here a case of cryptococcal lymphadenitis which is a very unusual initial presentation of AIDS. This is a case that very few studies have reported \\[ 3 – 5 \\].\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 45-year-old male hailing from Dhanbad district of Jharkhand state working as a staff in a courier service reported to medicine OPD of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Dhanbad with the chief complain of—soreness of mouth and difficulty in swallowing both solid and liquid since past 1 month, multiple episodes of fever on and off for one and a half months, mild cough with scanty expectoration and weight loss (not documented) since past 2 months.\n\n【6】Patient was apparently asymptomatic 2 months ago when his complaints started in the form of mild cough with scanty expectorations. It was gradual in onset, non-progressive, no diurnal variation. Symptoms sometimes showed relief on taking cough syrup containing codeine and dextromethorphan. The sputum was white in colour, non-blood tinged and mucoid in consistency. Patient also complained of loosening of clothes which used to fit him earlier.\n\n【7】Since past one and a half months, he complained of multiple episodes of fever on and off with no particular pattern. It was gradual in onset, non-progressive though little relief was seen on taking paracetamol. Gradually, the patient developed soreness of mouth and difficulty in swallowing both solid and liquid food items. It was gradual in onset with no complaint of burning sensation in mouth or heart burn.\n\n【8】Before the start of these complains or during this period, he was not on any drug (except for cough syrup and paracetamol).\n\n【9】On general physical examination, he was thin built, febrile, weighed 42 kg, BP 120/80 mmHg, pulse 96/min. Pallor was present. No icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema. On the examination of oral cavity, white keratotic lesions were seen over vestibular and buccal mucosa, suspected to be verrucous leukoplakia.\n\n【10】On systemic examination, no abnormalities were detected. Laboratory data revealed Hb 9.2 gm%, TC 2700/mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophil 79% and lymphocyte 21%. Ultrasonography (USG) of whole abdomen showed multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes (largest being 28 mm).This made us think that the patient was suffering from abdominal tuberculosis which might have disseminated from the lungs. So, now sputum was analysed for acid-fast Bacilli which was negative. Rest all investigations like chest X-ray, electrolytes, kidney function test, random sugar, routine urine, liver function test and lipid profile were within normal limit. Then blood was tested for HIV I and II and was found to be positive for HIV I. Therefore, he was now registered at the Anti Retroviral Therapy centre of PMCH Dhanbad on 28-03-2017. CD <sub>4 </sub> count was 58/mm <sup>3 </sup> which signifies stage 4 of the disease.\n\n【11】Based on high clinical suspicion and the epidemiological data, his treatment was started with antitubercular therapy (ATT) Cat-I on 30-03-2017 (consisting of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) and HAART (consisting of Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz) after 2 weeks on 14 April 2017 to avoid immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Even after 2 weeks, no clinical improvement was seen in the patient which according to the literature is one of the criteria to state that the patient had tuberculosis and get cured following ATT administration. Failure of above treatment advised us to do USG guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. Cytological reports showed large masses of round yeast like structure with negatively stained capsule admixed with lymphoid cells, plasma cells, foamy macrophages, epitheloid cells in the background of necrotic debris. These suggested a possibility of fungal (Cryptococcus) necrotizing granuloma involving the lymph nodes. No acid-fast bacilli were seen.\n\n【12】Following this report, ATT was stopped on 27 April 2017 and patient was referred to Rajendra Institute of Medical Science, Ranchi where he was treated with injection amphotericin B for 7 days followed by oral fluconazole and flucytosine. Flucytosine could not be continued after discharge from hospital due to financial constraints. After 15 days, patient came for follow-up and there was improvement in clinical symptoms and with the gain of 2 kg weight. The USG showed a decrease in size of the lymph nodes.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Cryptococcal infection is very much prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) especially in developing country like India \\[ 6 \\]. Approximately 1 million PLHIV are infected by this fungus and about 625 000 die annually \\[ 7 \\]. The most common organ affected by this fungus in these patients is the central nervous system \\[ 8 \\]. Lymphadenopathy due to cryptococcus is a very rare disease in PLHIV so any lymphadenopathy in AIDS patients should be thoroughly investigated. Though less but some such cases having similar picture have been reported from worldwide and India \\[ 9 \\]. A case has been described in a research article by U. Banerjee about a patient from north-eastern India presenting with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss and was suspected to have tuberculosis. ATT, however, was ineffective. So, a lymph node biopsy was done which revealed abundant _Cryptococcus neoformans_ cells. Following this, HIV seropositivity was suspected, and later confirmed. Afterwards, the serum was examined for cryptococcal antigen which was found to be positive. However, no CNS symptoms were present \\[ 10 \\]. In a case report by Dogbey _et al._ , final diagnosis was confirmed by lymph node biopsy but FNAC was suggested to diagnose such cases with both rapid and cost-effective method \\[ 3 \\]. Often, such cases are overlooked because we rarely suspect about Cryptococcus being a cause of lymphadenitis. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, cryptococcosis is one of the AIDS-defining criteria. Almost similar chief complaint of fever and weight loss over 15 days duration in an AIDS patient was seen in case report by Chandanwale \\[ 5 \\]. Finally, the diagnosis of supraclavicular lymphadenitis was pinned down to Cryptococcus which was diagnosed by FNAC. From the above case study and discussion, we hereby conclude that despite vast clinical experience and support from the epidemiology of a disease like ‘tuberculosis’ in India we should properly evaluate lymphadenopathy allowing FNAC as the minimum investigation. At times we miss this rare but important factor of lymphadenopathy in treating AIDS patients. This timely initiation of therapy shall also help to decrease the morbidity and mortality due to cryptococcosis in such patients.\n\n【15】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【16】None declared.\n\n【17】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【18】No funding source.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEGEMENT\n--------------\n\n【20】None.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【22】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【23】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【24】Not required.\n\n【25】PATIENT’S CONSENT\n-----------------\n\n【26】Consent from the patient has been obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Intravascular stents provide a new therapeutic approach, but the long-term outcome of stenting compared with medical outcome is controversial. External counterpulsation (ECP) is a noninvasive method to improve perfusion of vital organs. We report two cases of this combination with ECP treatment in addition to receiving endovascular stenting. Two patients experienced posterior ischemic stroke. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a severe basilar or vertebral artery stenosis. Computed tomographic perfusion revealed significantly decreased perfusion of posterior artery territories. Both of them underwent combined ECP treatment and endovascular stenting of the stenosed basilar or vertebral artery, without recurrent stroke within 30 days after stenting. The two patients were independent (modified Rankin scale ≤2) at the 12-month follow-up time. Combined ECP treatment and endovascular stent placement may be effective and safe for patients with symptomatic VBA stenosis who failed aggressive medical treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stenosis portends a poor prognosis despite medical therapy \\[ 1–3 \\]. Although angioplasty and stenting showed initial promise for the treatment of these patients \\[ 4–6 \\], the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Arterial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial revealed an unexpected higher rate of stroke and death within 30 days among patients treated with the wingspan stent than those treated with aggressive medical therapy alone (14.7 vs 5.8%, _P_ \\= 0.002) \\[ 7 \\]. The selection of a proper therapeutic strategy for symptomatic VBA stenosis remains a challenging clinical problem.\n\n【4】External counterpulsation (ECP) is a noninvasive method to improve perfusion of vital organs. In the ECP system, there are three pairs of pneumonic cuffs applied to the calves, lower thighs and upper thighs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) triggers cuff inflation sequentially from distal to proximal during diastole and releases cuff pressure before the start of systole by applying an ECG-triggered diastolic pressure of 250 mm Hg. The diastolic augmentation of the blood flow and the simultaneously decreasing systolic afterload, therefore, increase blood flow to the heart, brain and kidneys. The standard duration of ECP is generally several weeks (5 daily 1-h sessions each week for 7 weeks, for a total of 35 sessions). Our pilot study showed that ECP is feasible for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients with cerebral large artery disease by improving clinical neurological deficit \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【5】Taking our experience of ECP treatment in ischemic stroke with cerebral large artery stenosis, we report combined ECP and endovascular stenting treatment of two patients who presented with symptomatic VBA stenosis.\n\n【6】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【7】### Case 1\n\n【8】A 76-year-old man with 4 months history of monthly attack of transient ischemic attack (TIA) was admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. A neurological examination revealed dysarthria with mild left hemiparesis (Grade 4). He had history of hypertension hyperlipidemia and nonsmoking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed subacute infarct over right pons (Fig. 1 A). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed signal void of distal basilar artery (BA) (Fig. 1 B). Computed tomographic (CT) perfusion showed decrease in blood flow for bilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed that a high-grade stenosis of about 70% was noted in BA (Fig. 2 A). Before admission, the patient was given oral prescription of aspirin 80 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily for 4 months. After admission, he was given aspirin 80 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily and 35 daily 1-h ECP treatment sessions. Then, a wingspan stent was successfully inserted into the most critically stenosed BA. Post-procedure arteriogram showed widened caliber of the stenotic segment of BA (Fig. 2 B). At a 30-day follow-up, the patient was able to walk with frame. At a 12-month follow-up, the patient was independent \\[modified Rankin scale grade (mRS) ≤2)\\], and the DSA showed no migration, restenosis or intimal hyperplasia at the site of BA stent (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【9】Figure 1:\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】( **A** ) MRI shows subacute infarct over right pons (arrow).

A neurological examination revealed dysarthria with right-sided hemiplegia (Grade 0) and moderate left-sided hemiparesis (Grade 3). The patient had a history of drinking, hypertension diabetes and nonsmoking. He had three recurrent posterior circulation strokes during the past 3 months. The private MRI showed extensive brainstem and cerebellar infarct. CT angiography showed severe stenosis in left vertebral artery (V2/3 junction to V3 segment) and moderate stenosis in middle BA (Fig. 4 A). CT perfusion showed a very poor perfusion in the posterior circulation regions (Fig. 4 B). Before admission, the patient was given oral prescription of aspirin 80 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily for 3 months. After admission, he was given aspirin 80 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily together with atorvastatin 40 mg daily and totally 29 daily 1-h ECP treatment sessions. The right-sided limb power increased gradually over time during ECP. After completion of 29 sessions of ECP treatment, the right-sided upper limb power increased to 4 grade and lower limb power increased to 3 grade. However, the DSA still showed a high-grade stenosis of about 70% in left V3 segment and 60% stenosis in middle BA (Fig. 5 A). A wingspan stenting was successfully inserted into the severe stenosed segment of left V3 (Fig. 5 B). After stenting, CT perfusion showed significant improvement of cerebral perfusion over the posterior circulation regions (Fig. 4 C). At a 30-day follow-up, his condition was stable with wheelchair walking. At a 12-month follow-up, the patient was independent (mRS ≤ 2), although he rejected to perform DSA.\n\n【20】Figure 4:\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】( **A** ) CT angiography shows severe stenosis in left vertebral artery (V2/3 junction to V3 segment) and moderate stenosis in middle BA (arrow).

( **B** ) Post-stenting arteriogram shows widened caliber of the stenotic segment of left V3 segment (arrow).\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【27】The warfarin–aspirin symptomatic intracranial disease (WASID) study demonstrated that the incidence of stroke events in the region supplied by the stenotic arteries was still high, even though the patients were treated with warfarin or aspirin \\[ 1 \\]. The annual incidence of stoke due to stenosis of BA and vertebral artery was 10 and 7%, respectively. In recent years, endovascular stenting has been an effective strategy for the treatment of VBA stenosis due to the minimal invasion and high effectiveness \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In the present cases, two patients received pharmacotherapy with statins and/or antiplatelet drugs to control the risk factors of stroke before admission, but the response was still poor. Then, they were treated with combined ECP and endovascular stenting treatment, achieving a success rate of 100%. There were no recurrent strokes after 30-day follow-up. The clinical symptoms and signs were significantly improved, showing favorable short-term therapeutics effectiveness.\n\n【28】It has been reported that the incidence of in-stent restenosis was as high as 29.7% within ∼6 months after surgery, and 76% patients with in-stent restenosis were even asymptomatic \\[ 9 \\]. In the present cases, one patient was found without in-stent restenosis even after 1-year follow-up. Moreover, both patients were independent at 12-month follow-up, which indicates that the long-term effectiveness is also high. The high technical success rate and favorable outcomes after stenting may be probably related to the ECP therapy, a new treatment aiming to improve cerebral blood flow. During ECP treatment, middle cerebral artery mean flow velocities of stroke patients increased not only on the infarcted side (9.64%) but also on the non-infarcted side (9%) when compared with baseline by elevation of blood pressure \\[ 10 \\]. Flow augmentation induced by ECP suggests the improvement of cerebral perfusion and collateral supply from infarct ipsilateral and contralateral sides. However, the two cases were lack of transcranial Doppler monitoring on cerebral blood flow velocities in bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries, which may help to show the effects of ECP treatment on cerebral circulation. Therefore, we speculate that the poor posterior cerebral perfusion may be improved after a series of ECP treatment. To some degree, the favorable outcome may be attributed to improved cerebral perfusion and collateral supply via ECP treatment before stenting.\n\n【29】ECP operates through external pressure applied on pneumatic cuffs on lower extremities with advantages of easy manipulation, adjustable pressure and good tolerance. The commonest adverse effects of ECP are leg and lower back pain, hematuria and skin abrasion. However, based on the ECP registry database in our center, most patients tolerated ECP treatment well and were free of limiting side effects. The potential risks of increasing blood pressure induced by ECP may contain intracerebral hemorrhage and aggravation of edema. Sustained severe hypertension (blood pressure persistently >180/100 mm Hg) in our exclusion criteria of recruitment and real-time blood pressure monitoring during ECP are helpful to reduce risks of these hypertension-related events.\n\n【30】Currently, large randomized controlled studies on endovascular stenting versus medical therapy for symptomatic VBA stenosis are still lacking. Although this case report will not provide direct treatment recommendation about the combined treatment in patients, it provides important preliminary data on the technical success of stenting and favorable outcome of patients treated with combined ECP therapy and endovascular stenting. Whether combined ECP and stenting provides any benefit compared with stenting in these patients can only be established in a larger randomized trial.\n\n【31】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【32】None declared.\n\n【33】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【34】We thank Chinese University of Hong Kong (Focused Investment Scheme B) and the Institute of Innovative Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Severe dermatological adverse events are rare with these agents; however, they require direct recognition and management in order not to become life-threatening. Erythema multiforme (EM) belongs to a dermatopathic spectrum that includes immune-mediated, widespread hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs with varying degrees of severity and affects the skin and/or the mucosa. We hereby present a case of ribociclib- and palbociclib-related EM. We sought to report this case given the implication of two agents from the same drug class in EM onset. We also aim to emphasize the breadth of mechanisms of actions of CKIs, with an impingement in the immune system as well, and the importance of promptly identifying and handling such skin toxicities.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Erythema multiforme (EM) comprises an acute, immune-mediated, self-limited and sometimes recurring condition, which is considered a type IV hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections, medications and other various triggers \\[ 1 \\]. It affects the skin and/or mucous membranes, depending on its extent (minor or major), and its classic lesion is called ‘target or iris lesion’. Its lesions are typically initiated from the extremities with a predilection for the extensor surfaces, and they spread centripetally, even though patients’ trunk is usually less affected \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 interacting with cyclin D pose an essential role in cell division and proliferation, inducing the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Thus, CDK4/6 inhibitors (CKIs) block cell cycle progression. CKIs, including palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, are amongst the newest targeted therapies approved for locally advanced or metastatic ﻿hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer (BC). Their most common adverse events (AEs) are haematologic and gastrointestinal \\[ 3 \\]. Cutaneous toxicities have been reported to an ~15% of total AEs with CKIs and are mostly grade 1 \\[ 4 \\]. We hereby describe the case of a female patient who developed grade 2 EM while treated with ribociclib and later on with palbociclib.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 50-year-old premenopausal female was diagnosed with HR-positive and HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. She underwent a right mastectomy and axillary lymph node (LN) dissection, where 2 out of the 10 removed LNs were infiltrated. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy followed for 5 years, with tamoxifen and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue.\n\n【7】Fourteen years later, the patient complained about swelling in her right arm. On physical examination, swelling and palpable masses in the field of the preceded mastectomy and axilla, with infiltration of the overlying axillary skin, were found. The following imaging showed an 18-mm lesion on the right pectoralis major and the conterminous axilla, without pathological axillary LNs. The core biopsy from the lesion of the right axillary region confirmed the recrudescence of BC. The requested chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed multiple lung nodules (<1 cm). The patient was commenced on letrozole and ribociclib.\n\n【8】Almost 6 weeks later, she complained about a skin rash with a burning and itching sensation in both her upper extremities. On physical examination, erythematous, pink-to-violaceous, tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae were observed on her hands bilaterally ( Fig. 1 ). According to the patient, the lesions erupted 1 month after the initiation of the therapy and got worse over the last 2 weeks. The oral cavity was unaffected.\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】First eruption of EM-like skin lesions in palms, after treatment with letrozole and ribociclib.\n\n【12】Regarding her medical history, she suffered from Hashimoto thyroiditis and arterial hypertension. No use of new medications or other substances was reported.\n\n【13】The lesions had the typical appearance of EM. However, at this first evaluation, skin biopsies were not obtained. Given the suspicion of ribociclib-mediated skin toxicity, the permanent discontinuation of ribociclib was decided. The patient continued receiving letrozole, and the rash gradually abated. A month later, the CKI palbociclib was added to the treatment.\n\n【14】After the first cycle of palbociclib, the patient presented grade 3 neutropenia and recurrence of the skin rash. Again, she had tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae with the ‘bull’s eye’ appearance. A complete physical examination revealed an aphthous lesion in the hard palate. The skin punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion on the fourth finger due to its typical ‘bull’s eye’ appearance, adequate size and easy access. It showed epidermal and subepidermal vesiculation, apoptotic keratinocytes in all levels of the epidermis and moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltration associated with lymphocytic exocytosis and satellite cell necrosis as well as extravasation of red blood cells in the upper dermis ( Fig. 2 ). Melanin incontinence or neutrophils were not found in the infiltrate. These features confirmed the drug-mediated lichenoid skin reaction with characteristics of EM. The definite discontinuation of the CKIs was decided, and the patient was continued on letrozole. All lesions subsided within the next month. She remains in remission from BC (progression-free survival of 2 years) and without EM recurrence.\n\n【15】Figure 2\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】( **A** ) skin punch biopsy form the hand showing lichenoid infiltrate rich in lymphocytes in the upper dermis, epidermal and focal sub-epidermal vesiculation. ( **B** ) The marked basal cell hydropic degeneration and apoptosis resulted in epidermal vesiculation. (A and B) Haematoxylin and eosin stain. Magnification: (A) ×40, (B) ×100.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】The pathobiology of EM relies on the immune-mediated response to an inciting event. Infections constitute the trigger in ~90% of cases, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) being the most common precipitator factor \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In contrast to viral-associated EM, where the effector cytokine is interferon-γ (IFN-γ) \\[ 5 \\], cases of drug-induced EM are associated with tumour necrosis factor-a, perforin and granzyme B, which cause the epidermal destruction seen in the disease \\[ 1 \\]. In cases of drug-induced EM, lesions appear within 72 hours of drug exposure but occasionally erupt over 1–2 weeks. Duration from onset to healing, typically without complications, is <4 weeks, usually about 2 weeks \\[ 6 \\]. The diagnosis of EM is predominantly clinical, based on the patient’s history and physical examination. When the clinical picture is clear, a biopsy is not required because its findings are not specific to EM. In atypical presentation or recurrent EM without documented HSV infection, histopathological features may pose the main role in the differential diagnosis of EM from other entities that mimic its onset, such as urticaria, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, etc. \\[ 2 \\] The treatment of EM depends on the underlying aetiology and the disease severity. The main aim is to remove the impelling factor. In the case of a drug-induced EM, this entails the discontinuation of the responsible medication \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【20】The mechanism of action of CKIs is manifold. Apart from obstructing cell cycle proliferation, they are capable of upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I and enhancing antigen presentation \\[ 7 \\]. Moreover, they increase proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, programmed death-ligand 1 expression and infiltration of the effector T cells in the tumour microenvironment \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Last but not least, CKIs selectively deplete the T-regulatory population by suppressing their proliferation, decreasing their effect in subduing immune response simultaneously \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【21】CKIs are generally considered safe, with manageable side effects. The most frequently reported amongst them include haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, especially neutropenia with palbociclib and ribociclib and diarrhoea with abemaciclib \\[ 3 \\]. Skin reactions are also included in the spectrum of their AEs, yet they are usually considered mild and do not warrant a definite cessation of them \\[ 9 \\]. However, more severe skin toxicities, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, have been reported in the literature \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【22】Herein, we have presented a case of CKI-induced EM. In our case, EM erupted later than typically reported after drug exposure and occurred while on treatment both with ribociclib and palbociclib; thus, EM constituted a drug class-observed AE. We would like to emphasize that a multidisciplinary approach to oncological patients, as well as early recognition and sufficient management of skin toxicities, are mandatory in order to prevent lethal conditions and improve the quality of life of this population.\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【24】E.V., S.M. and M.B. declare no relevant conflict of interest.

He was hypotensive and an echocardiogram showed large extra-cardiac mass compressing the right ventricular outflow tract resulting in features of cardiac tamponade. Chest computed tomography revealed a mediastinal mass invading the pericardium adjacent to right ventricular outflow tract. Biopsy of the mass confirmed primary monophasic synovial sarcoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy along with anti-inflammatories were given as surgery was too high risk due to the location of the tumour and pericardial involvement. Patient responded briefly to the treatment with improvement in hemodynamic parameters but over next weeks he became less responsive to treatment with increasing size. He died 2 months after treatment commenced.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Synovial sarcomas are very rare soft tissue tumours derived from primitive pluripotent mesenchyme capable of epithelial differentiation presenting in adolescents and young adults. Primary origin in thorax is extremely rare, accounting for <1% of all malignancies in thorax and more prevalent in adults between 20 and 40 years old. Synovial sarcoma usually occurs in deep soft tissue of the extremities with metastasis to the thorax and abdomen. We report a rare case of mediastinal monophasic synovial sarcoma with pericardial involvement causing compression of right ventricle and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) leading to hemodynamic compromise.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 46-year-old man was referred for a chest X-ray following 6-month history of worsening dyspnoea, dry cough, night sweats, intermittent pyrexia and weight loss of 6 kg. The chest X-ray showed a large mass extending from the mediastinum to the left lateral chest. Laboratory blood tests showed a normocytic anaemia picture with a haemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL (13–18), raised ALP at 205 U/L (40–130) and GGT 350 U/L (0–55). Vitals signs recorded heart rate at 104 per minute, blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg, saturation of 94% on room air, and respiratory rate of 24 per minute. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of electrical alternans and pulsus paradoxus was 24 mmHg.\n\n【6】The patient subsequently had a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed localized pericardial effusion in the antero-apical region with maximum dimension of 2.5 cm. A mass was seen within the pericardial space near the RVOT compressing it. Flow turbulence was noted on colour Doppler along with acceleration of 1.5 m/s in the RVOT and in pulmonary trunk.\n\n【7】Urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a solid lobular left hemithorax mass measuring 17.6 × 11.0 × 18 cm causing significant displacement of mediastinal structures to the right. There was invasion into the pericardial cavity, with associated pericardial effusion (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【8】Figure 1:\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Computerized tomography of the chest: sagittal and transverse views showing marked extrinsic constriction of the RVOT\n\n【11】A biopsy of the mass showed tissue infiltrated with spindle cell tumour of monomorphic appearance consisting of densely packed cells with fine chromatin pattern, partially overlapping nuclei and scanty cytoplasm (Fig. 2 ). Immuneprofile revealed a strongly positive CD56 and focally positive epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed rearrangement of SS18 locus (SYT gene) at 18q:11.2 chromosome within spindle cells pericytomatous blood vessels are present. The above features were morphologically and immuneprofile consistent with monophasic sarcoma of Trojani Grade 2 (Fig. 2 ). He was reviewed by Oncology specialists who started him on Dexamethasone initially to reduce reactive inflammation to improve his hemodynamics and symptoms. Pulsus paradoxus improved within 48 h allowing for more treatment to commence. Following a case discussion at the multidisciplinary team meeting, he received chemotherapy initially with Liposomal Doxorubicin for cycle one with addition of Iphosphamide for cycle 2. He was to be considered for surgical resection of the tumour following the second cycle with the expectation of tumour shrink. Unfortunately, the patient died following 2 months of chemotherapy due to severe aggression of the tumour and failure of response to treatment.\n\n【12】Figure 2:\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】( **A** ) 3D CT chest reconstruction showing marked hypervascularity of the synovial sarcoma and the resulting compression of RV and RVOT.

This case presented with hemodynamic instability similar to cardiac tamponade due to effusion. Pericardiocentesis of the localized moderate effusion was not possible as the approach was obscured by the sarcoma. The reduction in swelling improved his blood pressure and pulsus paradoxus without any invasive treatment.\n\n【17】Synovial sarcomas are very rare soft tissue tumours derived from primitive pluripotent mesenchyme capable of epithelial differentiation presenting in adolescents and young adults. Primary origin in thorax is extremely rare, accounting for <1% of all malignancies in the thorax and more prevalent in adults between 20 and 40 years old \\[ 1 \\]. Synovial sarcoma usually occurs in deep soft tissue of the extremities with metastasis to the thorax and abdomen. There are four morphological types of synovial sarcoma—biphasic, monophasic, monophasic epithelial and poorly differentiated tumours \\[ 2 \\]. The biomarkers for these tumours include Vimentin, Cytokeratin and EMA positivity with EMA being the most common positive marker. Monophasic synovial sarcoma is a locally invasive tumour and the commonest of all the types constituting spindle cells on histology although epithelial cells might be seen. Genetic identification of t(X:18) translocation involving SYT gene on chromosome 18 and the SSX1 or SSX2 gene on the X chromosome, specific for synovial sarcoma is found in over 90% of patients \\[ 1 , 3 – 5 \\].\n\n【18】Treatment involves chemotherapy and or radiotherapy and resection of large tumours.

Her past medical history was stage II renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The patient was dyspneic and afebrile. Her observations were a respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 95/60, oxygen saturations of 85% (corrected with 50% venturi mask) and a heart rate of 86 (after treating with a beta-blocker). The admission ‘electrocardiogram’ showed sinus rhythm, first degree atrioventricular block and supraventricular extrasystoles. Lung auscultation was normal without any signs of left heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a giant mobile irregularly shaped echogenic mass in the right ventricle (RV), measuring 35 × 42 mm which was obstructing the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) ( Fig. 1A ). CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of a huge mass (area: 18.575 cm <sup>2 </sup> ) in the main pulmonary artery obstructing the RVOT, with no evidence of vascularization, suggesting RVOT thrombus ( Fig. 1B ). Emboli in the pulmonary vessels were not found. No thrombosis was found in the peripheral systemic veins.

Physical examination revealed pitting edema in the dorsum of both hands ( Fig. 1a ) and tenderness of bilateral shoulder and wrist joints. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scan indicated pleural effusion in both lungs ( Fig. 1b ). Blood test results showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP; 5.69 mg/dl; normal: < 0.3 mg/dl), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF: 346; normal: <38.8) and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (124; normal: <59.7). The results of rheumatoid factor test, anti-nuclear antibody and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody were negative. Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema syndrome (RS3PE) was diagnosed in accordance with the following diagnostic criteria \\[ 1–3 \\]: (i) pitting edema in the extremities with synovitis, (ii) acute onset, (iii) age ≥ 50 years and (iv) negative findings for rheumatoid factor.

After pericardial drainage for drug-resistant right heart failure, she developed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and cardiogenic shock caused by severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Findings during emergency surgery included tricuspid valve (TV) junction failure caused by shortening of the chordae tendineae of the TV, which is an organic abnormality. Additionally, myocardial biopsy results revealed myocarditis. Although acute myocarditis developed with RV dysfunction, pericardial effusion suppressed venous return, which temporarily improved her pathological condition. However, RV dysfunction and severe TR were thought to have manifested after the venous return suppression was alleviated by pericardial drainage. Because venous return changes significantly after pericardial drainage, it is necessary to examine the need for drainage and re-evaluate the post-operative RV system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pericardial effusion suppresses venous return, which may conceal right ventricular (RV) or tricuspid valve (TV) dysfunction. If pericardial drainage is performed for such cases, then increased venous return may reveal RV dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and the risk of cardiogenic shock may develop. We present the case of a patient with shortened chordae tendineae of the TV in whom pericardial effusion concealed severe TR. Drainage revealed TR, which was accompanied by RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with no apparent history of rheumatic fever and cardiac diseases presented with general malaise and was hospitalized. On admission, her blood pressure and pulse were 120/87 mmHg and 60 beats/minute, respectively. The blood test revealed the following results: brain natriuretic peptide, 186 pg/ml (reference, 0–18.4 pg/ml); cardiac troponin I, 0.038 ng/ml (reference, 0–0.025 ng/ml); creatinine kinase (CPK), 228 U/l (reference, 29–248 U/l); CPK-MB, 30 U/l (reference, 5–25 U/l) and C-reactive protein, 2.69 mg/dl (reference, 0–0.14 mg/dl). Furthermore, an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a marked PQ duration of 0.48 msec; however, no ST-segment elevation was noted by an 18-lead ECG. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal cardiac function and pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the RV and 18 mm around the left ventricle (LV; Fig. 1 ).\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】TTE at the time of admission; ( **A** ) Parasternal short-axis view: pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the right ventricle and 18 mm around the LV; ( **B** ) modified apical four-chamber view; TR insufficiency is unclear.\n\n【9】There was no obvious evidence of valvular diseases, including TR. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) revealed pericardial and thoracoabdominal effusions ( Fig. 2 ). On the day of admission, her hemodynamic status was stable and treatment was initiated with diuretics. However, the next day, her symptoms worsened and urine output was poor; therefore, pericardial drainage was performed to remove 320 ml of yellow and turbid pericardial fluid. The subjective symptoms improved thereafter; however, she experienced cardiogenic shock the day after treatment. TTE revealed that the TV ring diameter had enlarged from 33 mm (at admission) to 45 mm and that severe TR had developed ( Fig. 3 ). Emergency catheterization was performed to evaluate hemodynamics, coronary artery lesions and valvular diseases. Swan–Ganz catheterization revealed cardiac output, cardiac index and SvO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.35 l/min, 1.68 l/min/m <sup>2 </sup> and 45%, respectively. Increased right atrial pressure and an increased v-wave were also observed ( Fig. 4 ). Right ventriculography ( Fig. 5 ) revealed a 30% decrease in the RV ejection fraction and severe TR (Seller’s classification grade 3). The coronary artery and LV ejection fraction were normal, and mild mitral regurgitation was noted. Furthermore, a myocardial biopsy of the RV septum was performed. Despite insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, her hemodynamic status did not improve. Because of circulatory failure caused by severe TR, TV replacement (TVR) surgery was performed (27 mm; MAGNA MITRAL EASE Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Intraoperatively, the chordae tendineae of the TV were markedly shortened ( Fig. 6 ). Thereafter, a biopsy revealed T-lymphocyte infiltration and myocardial fibrosis ( Fig. 7 ). The patient was diagnosed with acute myocarditis. She was discharged 45 days after admission and remained free of cardiovascular events for the next 3 years.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Thoracic and abdominal CT performed at admission; ( **A** ) moderate pericardial effusion and right pleural effusion at the transverse section; ( **B** ) moderate pericardial effusion at the coronal section.\n\n【13】Figure 3\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】TTE after pericardial drainage; ( **A** ) apical four-chamber view: severe TR signal using Doppler echo with TV insufficiency during systole; ( **B** ) parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level: TV insufficiency during systole; a severe TR signal is noted secondary to TV insufficiency using Doppler echo.\n\n【16】Figure 4\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Right ventriculography image obtained in the 30° right anterior oblique view shows a 5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted via the right femoral vein approach; the contrast concentrations in the right ventricle and right atrium appear nearly identical.\n\n【19】Figure 5\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Intracardiac pressure waveform with a Swan–Ganz catheter; ( **A** ) the right atrial mean pressure is 15 mmHg; arrows indicate an increase in the v-wave height; ( **B** ) the RV systolic pressure is 34 mmHg, whereas the RV end-diastolic pressure is 15 mmHg; ( **C** ) the pulmonary artery pressure is 34/15 mmHg; ( **D** ) the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is 18 mmHg; ( **E** ) the LV systolic pressure is 123 mmHg, whereas the LV end-diastolic pressure is 20 mmHg; ( **F** ) the aortic pressure is 119/60 mmHg.\n\n【22】Figure 6\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Surgical findings during TVR; ( **A** ) arrows indicate the shortened TV chordae tendineae; ( **B** ) the arrow indicates the shortened TV chordae tendineae; the chordae tendineae were shortened to the extent that the papillary muscle and leaflet were almost attached.\n\n【25】Figure 7\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】Histopathological findings after RV myocardial biopsy; ( **A** ) infiltration of T lymphocytes and disappearance of cardiomyocytes are observed in some parts of the myocardial tissue; ( **B** ) enlarged image of the circled region in (A); vasculitis and fibrosis of the cardiomyocytes are observed.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】This case comprised underlying organic abnormalities of the chordae tendineae of the TV and incidental presentation with RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis. Pericardial drainage, which was performed as treatment, caused the TR and RV dysfunction to manifest and led to cardiogenic shock. Pericardial drainage reportedly causes preload variation before and after drainage in the right heart system, which is susceptible to pericardial cavity pressure; furthermore, the RV diastolic volume increases after pericardial drainage \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【30】Compared to in the general population, the right heart system was more susceptible to venous return of this patient with shortened TV chordae tendineae, which led to the enlargement of the right heart system and severe TR caused by TV junction insufficiency. Acute myocarditis can be fatal, mainly because of pump failure and fatal arrhythmias secondary to LV dysfunction \\[ 2 \\]; however, RV dysfunction secondary to myocarditis alone can be serious in patients with organic abnormalities (such as TV tendon shortening). It should be noted that acute myocarditis causing only RV dysfunction may also cause hemodynamic instability.\n\n【31】Severe RV function and TV dysfunction have occurred after pericardial drainage \\[ 3 \\]. Our patient was at high risk because her symptoms worsened after admission and pericardial drainage was a priority. If the presence and severity of myocarditis could have been ascertained by gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; because of the possibility of acute myocarditis based on the presence of increased myocardial deviation enzymes and atrioventricular conduction delay on admission), then pericardial drainage might have been avoided. Colchicine administration is effective for pericardial effusion caused by pericarditis \\[ 4 \\]. In this case, acute myocarditis was not diagnosed initially; TVR was performed to manage TV chordae tendineae shortening, which is an organic disorder. However, if the transient RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis had been an exacerbating factor, then medical therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would have improved the situation, and TVR might not have been necessary. For a previously reported case, medical therapy achieved an improvement in cardiogenic shock caused by RV dysfunction combined with TV dysfunction after pericardial drainage \\[ 5 \\]. Conversely, TVR still may have been necessary for the present case because of the tendon abnormality.\n\n【32】TR is classified as primary and secondary. Primary TR, a structural abnormality of the TV, accounts for ~8% of all TR cases \\[ 6 \\]; possible causes include Epstein’s malformation, infective endocarditis, pacemaker leads, chest trauma and rheumatic fever. Conversely, congenital TR with structural abnormalities but without a history of these conditions has also been reported; some cases have been diagnosed at an advanced age \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Our patient likely had congenital TR.\n\n【33】Pericardial drainage is necessary for the treatment and identification of the cause. If the TV involves an organic abnormality (as in this case), or if acute myocarditis has spread to the RV, then venous return will have a strong, negative hemodynamic effect. Screening with MRI and TTE may help reduce the risks of TR and RV dysfunction after pericardial drainage.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】None declared.\n\n【36】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【37】None.\n\n【38】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【39】Institutional review board approval was not required for this case report.\n\n【40】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【41】Written informed consent for the publication of this case was obtained from the patient.\n\n【42】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【43】Higuchi Motoaki.\n\n【44】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【45】We would like to thank Editage ( www.editage.com ) for English language editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
