Hyperprolactinemia can lead to various different symptoms including anorgasmia. It is important to identify any sexual dysfunction, but also any other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, in elderly patients during medical history taking and not to assume that elderly people are sexually inactive. Anorgasmia and any other sexual dysfunction in elderly can have an impact on their mental health and may even lead to depression and anxiety.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hyperprolactinemia is defined as excessive prolactin levels in the blood. Prolactin is primarily secreted from the anterior pituitary gland. The endocrine function of prolactin is to enable lactation.\n\n【4】In women of reproductive age, hyperprolactinemia may lead to secondary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and infertility. Other symptoms of hyperlactatemia include lactorrhea and anorgasmia. However, the majority of hyperprolactinemia cases remain asymptomatic.\n\n【5】Prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is primarily controlled by hypothalamus. Lactotrophs exhibit D2 receptors, which can be stimulated by dopamine. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion by binding to D2 receptors. Thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of prolactin.\n\n【6】Chest wall irritation (e.g. HZV infection or surgery) can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Other causes include prolactinoma, antipsychotic medication, anti-hypertensive treatment and renal failure amongst others, but some are idiopathic.\n\n【7】The mechanism in which herpes Zoster infection over the chest can cause hyperprolactinemia is by nerve stimulation that leads to prolactin release.\n\n【8】The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia is 0.4% in the general population and most cases are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】CASE\n----\n\n【10】A 98-year-old lady living in a residential home was referred to mental health services by her GP following concerns raised by her carers who reported she was low in mood. Her carers additionally suspected that she was planning on taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets.\n\n【11】The duty mental-health professional who assessed the referral for patient X had conducted a visit to her home. In the assessment, patient X disclosed that she was embarrassed to reveal the reason behind her mental health deterioration, despite this she was willing to talk about it because she wanted to find a solution to her problem. Patient X was started on the antidepressant Mirtazapine for her low mood; however, her mental health did not improve. She reported continuing symptoms that could be attributed to a depressive episode including insomnia, reduced appetite and an inability to relax due to feeling tense all the time.\n\n【12】Patient X revealed that from the time she started developing shingles a few weeks earlier she had been unable to reach orgasm by masturbation, but that she still had intense sexual urges. She explained that her anorgasmia had caused her anxiety and depressed mood. Patient X’s distress had led her to becoming suicidal and to wanting to harm herself by overdosing on tablets or stabbing herself. She was then admitted to an inpatient mental health unit due to her high risk of self-harm.\n\n【13】She was not responding to the antidepressant medication that was started. Her inpatient medical team conducted investigations to identify potential organic causes for patient X’s anorgasmia.\n\n【14】Interestingly, her admission blood tests revealed a raised prolactin level of 1068 ml/u. Her only symptoms attributed to hyperlactatemia were increased facial hair and anorgasmia. She also had pain over her chest which was believed to be due to her herpes zoster infection. There was no lactorrhea or breast engorgement noted on examination.\n\n【15】Recent blood tests indicated that her thyroid function, liver function, kidney function and full blood count were within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan was ordered to exclude a prolactinoma, and this was normal. She also had several physical examinations done of her genital area and pelvis to exclude a herpes infection causing sexual dysfunction. The results of these examinations were unremarkable. On physical examination of her chest, an erythematous rash with blisters was evident over her right breast, extending to her nipples. She also complained of neuropathic pain. The distribution of the rash and clinical picture was in accordance with a recent herpes zoster infection. No Breast mass was detected.\n\n【16】A medication review was made to identify any pharmacological causes of the raised prolactin levels. Patient X was on regular amlodipine for hypertension which is not known to raise prolactin levels. Because of her psychotic symptoms, patient X had been started on aripiprazole, an antipsychotic medication that is not known to cause significant raised prolactin levels (and is sometimes used as an adjunct to lower prolactin levels caused by other antipsychotics that cause raised prolactin).\n\n【17】After conducting the aforementioned investigations for raised prolactin levels, it was concluded that the patient’s hyperprolactinemia was most probably secondary to her recent herpes zoster infection/shingles, which was fairly extensive, involving the patient’s right breast and extending all the way to the nipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As the patient’s herpes infection improved with treatment, patient X’s prolactin levels also normalized gradually and her inability to orgasm resolved.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Doctors should consider the more unique possible causes of the raised prolactin levels when treating a patient with hyperprolactinemia. Any chest wall irritation can cause hyperprolactinemia due to the stimulation reflex. Examples of some of these causes are chest wall trauma, burns, surgery and herpes zoster infection.\n\n【21】It is important to consider elderly patient’s sexual wellbeing, especially if hyperprolactinemia has been detected as this may have a negative impact on their sexual health. One possible cause of sexual dysfunction is hyperprolactinemia and patients with such problems should have their prolactin levels checked. Once hyperprolactinemia is diagnosed, it is important to exclude any pituitary prolactinoma excreting excessive prolactin using MRI brain imaging. Prolactinomas are the commonest types of pituitary tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hyperprolactinemia may be a result of pregnancy, lactation, chest wall stimulation, stress, sleep, epileptic seizures, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal failure amongst other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The patient’s medications should be reviewed as certain medication groups such as antipsychotics, antidepressants as well as antihypertensive medications can cause hyperprolactinemia. Amongst these medication groups, antipsychotics are the primary pharmacological cause of hyperprolactinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is appropriate for clinicians to start psychotic patients with known hyperprolactinemia on antipsychotic medication that have a safer profile when it comes to prolactin levels. The consultant responsible for patient X’s care appropriately chose the second-generation antipsychotic Aripiprazole because of the fact that the prolactin levels are less likely to be affected by this medication.\n\n【24】In patient X’s case, the only explanation remaining for her hyperprolactinemia was the herpes infection across her right breast. The onset of her sexual dysfunction also coincided with the onset of her herpes infection.\n\n【25】The cause of this 98-year-old patient’s mental health deterioration was her anorgasmia, which was a result of hyperprolactinemia caused by irritation to her chest wall from a recent herpes infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【27】I am grateful to staff at Scadbury ward, Oxleas NHS Trust, for their safe and appropriate management of the patient.\n\n【28】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】No funding was obtained.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】Ethical approval not required.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Consent has been gained, and consent form was signed by the patient.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】Dr Sarah Moslehi is the guarantor of this case report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A life-threatening and potentially fatal manifestation of thyrotoxicosis is thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is considered rare with an occurrence rate of 1–2% of all patients with hyperthyroidism, making a high index of suspicion important in the early recognition of this debilitating complication. We present the case of a 63-year-old female with a significant history of being non-compliant with her hyperthyroidism regimen and presented to the emergency department in severe respiratory distress. She was ultimately diagnosed with thyroid storm induced high-output congestive heart failure, intubated, had a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the intensive care unit in a guarded condition. Her hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged on Day 12.\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】The most common underlying etiology of a thyroid storm is Grave’s disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyrotropin receptor antibodies. As an endocrine emergency and sepsis mimic, thyroid storm becomes a must recognize disease process, with an untreated mortality of 100% and 10–50% with treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of thyroid storm is diverse, presents within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis and requires a multifactorial treatment regimen. As a severe hypermetabolic condition, thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician.\n\n【4】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) in severe respiratory distress. She stated, ‘I had asthma as a kid, this kind of feels like that.’ Symptoms started abruptly 2 days ago while she was leaving her house to go shopping and continued to progressively get worse. Associated symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic chest pain, diaphoresis and lightheadedness. She denied any recent travel, hormone replacement, prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, calf pain/leg pain or any other symptoms. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure 220/114 mmHg, respiratory rate up to 42 breaths/min, heart rate of 124 beats/min and a pulse ox of 88% on a non-rebreather. Physical exam was notable for severe respiratory distress and diaphoresis with conversational dyspnea, intercostal retractions and supraclavicular retractions. The patient was not wanting to talk or move secondary to the shortness of breath. Examination of the head and neck revealed no evidence for proptosis; however, she did exhibit fullness to her thyroid bilaterally. Her cardiopulmonary exam revealed diffuse rales in all lung fields and no obvious murmur. Her lower extremities were significant for 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure on arrival, a high dose nitroglycerine infusion was started and furosemide was given. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus tachycardia at 119 with biatrial enlargement. Chest radiography, Fig. 1 , shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Chest radiography shows bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Findings consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\n【9】Blood pressure improved to 170/70 mmHg, and the patient was able to communicate regarding her medical history. She noted intermittent palpitations for over 1 year, decreased appetite, an unintentional 10-lb weight loss and blurry vision. Chart review revealed that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level performed as an outpatient 2 months prior returning a value of <0.01. At that time, a thyroid ultrasound was performed and was concerning for a solid right thyroid nodule measuring up to 1.8 cm. A subsequent technetium thyroid study revealed a goiter with increased technetium trapping consistent with the clinical suspicion of Graves’ disease. The patient had refused radioiodine therapy. She was prescribed methimazole and propranolol as an outpatient, but missed multiple doses frequently.\n\n【10】Within 5 minutes of arrival, she began to decompensate, with increasing diaphoresis, tachypnea, hypoxia, bradycardia and lethargy. Decision was thus made to intubate utilizing etomidate and rocuronium. Subsequent chest radiography post intubation, Fig. 2 , shows a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. Approximately 4 minutes later, her rhythm went from bradycardic into asystole. Advanced cardiac life support protocol was followed, with a resulting return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 5 minutes. Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion or right heart strain. CT angiography of the chest, Figs 3 and 4 , shows no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Chest radiography post intubation showing a re-demonstration of diffuse pulmonary edema, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.\n\n【14】**Figure 3**\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【17】**Figure 4**\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast showing no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature, and re-demonstration of multifocal ill-defined patchy/fluffy airspace consolidative and ground glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, favored to represent pulmonary edema.\n\n【20】Laboratory evaluation was notable for a TSH <0.01 (0.40–4.50 mcIU/ml), free T3 of 10.2 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml), free T4 of 2.7 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL), brain natriuretic peptide of 566 (0–100 pg/ml), troponin of 0.01/0.12/0.24 (0.00–0.04 ng/ml) and blood glucose of 210. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 89, p02 345, HCO3 23. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable. No other acute lab abnormalities were found.\n\n【21】The case was discussed with endocrinology and she was started on the following regimen: propranolol 1 mg IV followed by 60 mg PO every 6 hours via her nasogastric tube, methimazole 20 mg loading dose followed by 20 mg every 6 hours, SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral Solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours, hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours and cholestyramine powder 4 gm via NG tube q6 hours. The patient was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition for suspected high output congestive heart failure secondary to thyroid storm from a non-compliance with her hyperthyroidism treatment. The elevated troponin was deemed likely a type II mechanism related to hypoxia, bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【22】By Day 2, the patient was alert on the ventilator, answering yes or no questions and doing well on spontaneous breathing trials. A formal 2D echocardiography showed mild eccentric mitral regurgitation, trace pulmonic insufficiency, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. By Day 5, she was transferred out of the ICU. By Day 7, her free T3 was approaching normal at 2.1 (2.3–4.2 pg/ml) and her free T4 normalized at 2.4 (0.8–1.8 ng/dL). It will take several weeks for the TSH to return to normal. Her remaining hospital course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on Day 12. She later underwent radioactive iodine ablation as an outpatient. There will likely be a need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy once the patient develops an underactive thyroid. At her most recent endocrinology follow-up appointment, she remains compliant, has had a full return to baseline activities and enjoys spending time with her family.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Thyroid storm is a severe hypermetabolic condition resulting in increased sensitivity and expression of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to a higher response to endogenous catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are number of causes, including, but not limited to the following: medical non-compliance, untreated thyroid disease, trauma, myocardial ischemia, infection, overdose of thyroid hormone and diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our patient, her thyroid storm was secondary to medical non-compliance with her hyperthyroid medication and non-compliance with the recommended radioactive iodine treatment.\n\n【25】For the emergency physician, laboratory evaluation will reveal a TSH that is usually low or undetectable with an associated elevated T3 and T4. Other laboratory findings can include anemia, lower serum creatinine, hypercalcemia or thrombocytopenia. If adrenal insufficiency is also present, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation is extremely diverse, with similarities to a hyperadrenergic state, with multiple systems being affected.\n\n【26】*   Central nervous system manifestations (altered mental status, seizures, agitation, lethargy, psychosis and coma)\n\n【27】*   Cardiovascular manifestations (sinus tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chest pain, wide pulse-pressure and dyspnea on exertion)\n\n【28】*   Gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea)\n\n【29】*   Skin manifestations (flushed, warm, moist and possible vitiligo and hyperpigmentation)\n\n【30】*   Thyroid gland manifestations (diffuse enlargement, neck fullness and thyroid tenderness)\n\n【31】As the disease process progresses, excess amounts of thyroid hormone begin to have a significant impact on cardiovascular hemodynamics. The result is high-output congestive heart failure (an uncommon type of heart failure) as the cardiac tissue has an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. Characteristic features of a high-output congestive heart failure include an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. In this particular form of heart failure, the increased cardiac output is greater than the metabolic demand. Patients will present with an increased stroke volume, increased myocardial contractility, increased ejection fraction, atrial arrhythmia and systolic hypertension with an associated wide pulse pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If left untreated, the result is eventual dilated cardiomyopathy, lethal dysrhythmias and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This concept of high-output congestive heart failure is counterintuitive to the typical congestive heart failure secondary to other causes, such as a myocardial infarction, that results in decreased myocardial contractility, low cardiac output and ventricular arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Being within the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis, distinguishing severe thyrotoxicosis from thyroid storm can challenge even the most skilled physician. One set of diagnostic criteria that can be used to aid in diagnosing thyroid storm is the Burch-Wartofsky Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Components include the degree of fever, tachycardia, presence of atrial fibrillation, presence of congestive heart failure, any gastrointestinal dysfunction and any central nervous system dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A score greater than 45 points is diagnostic of thyroid storm, 25–44 points is associated with an impending thyroid storm and <25 points is unlikely. Our patient received 10 points for a fever of 101.2°F, 15 points for a heart rate of 124 beats/min, 20 points for congestive heart failure and 10 points for agitation, for a total score of 55 points. Another diagnostic aid that can be utilized in diagnosing thyroid storm are the criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association (presence of thyrotoxicosis in addition to at least one central nervous system dysfunction in combination with fever, CHF, tachycardia or gastrointestinal abnormality) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Treatment is multifactorial and involves a specific order to the treatment regimen as outlined below.\n\n【34】1.  Beta blocker is used to block the peripheral effects of the thyroid hormones and prevent the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is used for this reason to treat the systemic effects (starting dose is often 1 mg IV push, titrating 1–3 mg q10 minutes and PO formulations dosed at 60–80 mg q6 hours) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In our patient, she received 1 mg IV of propranolol and started on a PO formulation.\n\n【35】2.  Administration of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole is utilized to inhibit the _de novo_ synthesis of T3 and T4. PTU is typically given as a 600–1000 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg q6. Methimazole is typically given as a 20–30 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 20–30 mg q6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】3.  Administration of SSKI Potassium Iodine Oral solution 5 gtts q6–8 hours or Lugol’s solution 4–8 gtts q6 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These will block the release of pre-formed thyroid hormones.\n\n【37】4.  Administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8 hours or Dexamethasone 2–4 mg q6 hours) as thyroid storm causes depression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis. In addition, corticosteroids have the ability inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】5.  Administration of cholestyramine powder (4 g PO q6 hours) aids in reducing thyroid hormone levels by interfering with anterior hepatic circulation and recycling of thyroid hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Definitive treatment often post-hospitalization involves surgery or radioactive iodine, as our patient had received. The Journal of Clinical Apheresis published an article in 2018 regarding patients that cannot undergo thyroidectomy or fail pharmacotherapy. In these patients, plasma exchange has been suggested as another treatment option; however, the optimal role is not established and there are only a limited number of cases within the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】To decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with thyroid storm, an emergency medicine physician must consider this diagnosis in any patient presenting to the ED in a hypermetabolic state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common cause of death in thyroid storm is cardiopulmonary failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As a result, quick recognition and treatment is critical for patient survival.\n\n【41】Conflict of interest\n--------------------\n\n【42】None declared.\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial support was received for this study.</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No approval is required.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G.T. is the guarantor of this study.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Subsequent biopsy of the temporal arteries showed panarteritis without giant cells and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. His symptoms improved in a day following treatment and he was discharged on a Prednisone taper. At the time of writing this case, there are only two cases in the literature of ptosis as a presenting symptom in GCA, thus highlighting the importance of recognizing rare red flag symptoms such as ptosis and diplopia. More study is needed in the prognostic significance of these unusual clinical features.\n\n【2】giant cell arteritis , ptosis , diplopia\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also commonly known as temporal arteritis, is a disease with severe morbidity, largely due to the devastating permanent visual loss that can affect up to 15–25% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It remains a disease of older Caucasians, with the highest incidence noted in Scandinavians and populations descended from them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although most healthcare providers are aware of the common red flag symptoms of GCA such as blurriness of vision, headache and jaw claudication, lesser known manifestations such as isolated third nerve palsies (ptosis), diplopia and Horner’s syndrome can also occur. In fact, there are only two reported cases in the literature of isolated third nerve palsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, highlighting the significance of this unusual symptom in what is already a rare condition.\n\n【5】Here, we describe an interesting case of GCA which first presented as ptosis and diplopia.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with progressively worsening headache that started 5 weeks prior. He described his headache as constant, sharp, localized to bilateral temporal regions with radiation to the eyes, waking him up from sleep and minimally relieved with Ibuprofen use. He denied having similar symptoms in the past. Four weeks after his headache started, he noted new left eyelid drooping with tearing, redness, double and blurry vision . The double vision had resolved upon presentation. In addition, he also described myalgias in all four extremities for ~2 weeks, limiting him from lifting his arms above his head or getting up from a squatted position. Past medical history was notable for COPD, hypertension and 80 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam was significant for trace left ptosis, conjunctival injection; visual acuity was 20/70 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left with unremarkable appearance of the optic nerves.\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Patient 1 week prior to presentation.\n\n【11】Laboratory studies obtained were significant for elevated C-reactive protein: 14.4 \\[reference range (RR): <1.0 mg/dl\\] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 54 (RR: 0–20 mm/h). Other laboratory work including thyroid stimulating hormone, creatinine kinase, vitamin D level, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed non-calcified pulmonary nodules without any concerning features. This constellation of findings was highly suspicious for temporal arteritis associated with polymyalgia rheumatica and he was immediately started on 1000 mg of intravenous Methylprednisolone given daily for 3 days. Imaging studies including CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiogram of head and neck were noted to be unremarkable. Bilateral temporal artery biopsy was obtained, which showed panarteritis, predominantly lymphocytes admixed with few histiocytes and occasional eosinophils. Giant cells were not seen. Elastic stain highlighted the disruption of internal elastic lamina .\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Elastic staining of left temporal artery showing disruption of the internal elastic lamina (green arrow).\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Elastic stain showing disruption of internal elastic lamina of right temporal artery (green arrow).\n\n【18】**Figure 4**\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Patient 2 weeks after initiation of treatment.\n\n【21】Patient reported improvement in symptoms after 2 days of steroids and he was discharged on a Prednisone taper. Two weeks after discharge, he reported feeling much better with only very mild headache and no visual symptoms at all .\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】GCA is a granulomatous vasculitis that affects medium-to-large vessels. GCA more commonly affects females and those over the age of 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its effects have been known to be devastating, with permanent visual loss being one of the known complications. Early diagnosis and treatment have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of irreversible blindness in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】ACR has well-known criteria for the diagnosis of GCA  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> since 1990. Three out of five are considered to be positive with a high sensitivity and specificity. Currently, these criteria are undergoing possible revision with the inclusion of imaging validations. Temporal artery biopsy is considered the gold standard; however, it has a sensitivity of only 15–40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. About 25% of biopsies do not show granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> as demonstrated in our patient above.\n\n【25】**Figure 5**\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】ACR criteria for GCA.\n\n【28】The pathogenesis of GCA remains poorly understood. One of the mechanisms appears to be the innate pathway in which there is recognition of host cells as foreign by dendritic cells, with activation of the inflammatory cascade, the key mediators being CD4+, IFN-y and IL-6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The other important mechanism is the antigen-driven response, by which vessels are affected—the arterial walls are compromised, resulting in focal ischemic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】As noted above, visual disturbances are important diagnostic symptoms, including visual loss, either partial or complete; amaurosis fugax; double vision and ocular pain. Of these, diplopia occurs rarely and is present in ~5–10% of GCA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, though this is likely underreported due to its transient and retrospective nature, as it was for our patient. Diplopia is associated with higher incidence of permanent visual loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Ptosis in GCA remains even more rare. Though there have been some reports in the literature of Horner’s syndrome in GCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>, pupil-sparing isolated third nerve palsies were only noted twice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u> The pathogenesis behind ptosis or Horner’s syndrome remains obscure, likely due to the rarity of this manifestation; however, evidence points to muscle ischemia as the cause behind the visual compromise. In an autopsy done of a patient with ophthalmoplegia secondary to GCA, the extraocular muscles were noted to be necrosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, suggesting that GCA contributes to internal and external carotid artery ischemia and, subsequently, muscle ischemia and necrosis. There are no data on the effect of Horner’s syndrome or isolated third nerve palsies on the prognosis of visual loss in GCA. This remains to be further studied.\n\n【31】Corticosteroids remain the first line of treatment in GCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In patients with neurological or ophthalmological manifestations, the equivalent of Prednisone at 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days is initiated after which a maintenance dose is started. In patients without visual involvement, 40–60 mg/day can be given to patients. Corticosteroids are often needed for months and it is important to give concurrent PPI as well as calcium and vitamin D supplementation.\n\n【32】Methotrexate has an important role in patients who are steroid-reliant by reducing the dosage required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Recently, Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6 receptor humanized monoclonal antibody, has been used as a steroid-sparing drug with excellent remission rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】GCA is a time-sensitive disease—early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing vision loss. Interestingly, ptosis and diplopia happen to be very rare ophthalmic symptoms of GCA. Hence, patients presenting with isolated third nerve palsies should be carefully assessed for high-risk vasculitis such as GCA.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】None declared.\n\n【36】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【37】None.\n\n【38】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【39】Not applicable.\n\n【40】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【41】Written consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【42】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【43】Anoka Martis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, generally, most patients with sepsis from rural area initially visit the emergency department at a rural hospital and are managed in general medical wards in Japan. Here we report on an 81-year-old Japanese female manifesting septic shock caused by the upper urinary tract infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing _Escherichia coli_ secondary to the left ureter obstruction by the urothelial carcinoma. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Although critical for the source control of infection, drainage of the ureteropelvic junction could not be performed immediately because of catecholamine-resistant hypotension. Hence, we administered polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion, followed by low-dose hydrocortisone administration. After 8 hours of infusion, she recovered from the septic shock and successfully underwent emergency percutaneous nephrostomy. This presented strategy may provide a new resolution of catecholamine-resistant patients in urosepsis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Urosepsis caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) accounts for 20%–30% of sepsis cases, and uroseptic shock is a disease with high mortality, mainly caused by obstructive uropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is a device that purifies blood by neutralizing circulating endotoxins, thereby inhibiting the progression of the septic cascade mediated by lipopolysaccharide, a core lipid portion of the gram-negative bacterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Studies have demonstrated that PMX-DHP reduces hospital mortality and the length of intensive care unit stay in patients with acute-phase septic shock control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the long term effect of PMX-DHP on survival rate has been insignificant in the ABDOMIX and EUPHRATES studies, despite an improvement in mean arterial pressure elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Glucocorticoids increase the sensitivity of alpha- and beta-adrenaline receptors. An adjunctive low-dose steroid has been reported to significantly shorten the time to recover from septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Various effects of glucocorticoids, including immune-modulating properties through interaction with NF-κB and elevation of blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenesis in the liver and peripheral tissues, are favorable against septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In Furano city, a rural area in the northern part of Japan, there are no facilities such as helicopters to transfer patients to an intensive care unit of an urban hospital after sunset. Such patients need to be treated with available medical resources. In this case report, we present a case of uroseptic shock caused by the obstructive pyelonephritis, that was successfully treated at a rural hospital with a combination of PMX and a low-dose steroid.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】An 81-year-old Japanese woman with twice histories of UTI presented to our emergency department with fever, anorexia and immobility around 4 pm. Her initial physical findings presented clear consciousness, body temperature of 37.5°C that continued since 3 days ago, upper extremity blood pressure (BP) of 68/36 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm with irregular rhythm, respiratory rate of 24 cycles per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% with 6 L/min of 100% oxygen administration via a Venturi mask. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left costovertebral angle. The urine was white and cloudy in appearance and the leukocyte esterase test was positive. Microscopic examination revealed more than 50/hpf of white blood cells (WBC). Blood test revealed significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers, such as WBC, 27.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/μl with 93.8% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; blood urea nitrogen, 31.2 of mg/dl; creatinine, 2.7 mg/dl; C-reactive protein, 26.7 mg/dl; glucose, 70 mg/dl; lactate, 3.3 m mol/L; and endotoxins, 2000 pg/ml. The arterial blood gas test revealed a pH of 7.39, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 33 mm Hg, and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 80.9 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Noncontrast computed tomography imaging revealed a left ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction by a mass containing low-density fluid, which was diagnosed as an abscess by the radiologist . She was diagnosed with uroseptic shock secondary to the obstructive pyelonephritis with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 3 points.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Computed tomography image of percutaneous nephrostomy. (a) Debris present in the left dilated renal pelvis (arrow). (b) The percutaneous nephrostomy tube properly placed in the left kidney (arrow).\n\n【10】The initial treatment comprising administration of intravenous fluids (2000 ml), intravenous norepinephrine of up to 0.3 μg/kg/min, and carbapenem 1.0 g was started; however, the shock vitals persisted. Thus, the initial source control by percutaneous nephrostomy was not performed due to the hypotension. To further account for hypotension and sepsis simultaneously, PMX-DHP was initiated and intravenous hydrocortisone of 240 mg was administered. The BP, HR and mean arterial pressure recovered to 125/80 mm Hg, 95 mm Hg and 80 bpm, respectively, in 8 hours. Then, the percutaneous nephrostomy was performed and the abscess at the UPJ was successfully drained . Urine and blood culture results reported on Day 4 revealed the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ and therefore, the initial treatment of carbapenem was continued. The patient completely recovered in 2 weeks. She finally underwent total left nephroureterectomy on Day 65 with uneventful recovery. The pathological diagnosis revealed a high-grade noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma .\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Gross and microscopic pathology. (a) Gross examination shows the urothelial carcinoma of the left renal pelvic (arrow). (b) Histopathologic examination shows high-grade noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, hematoxylin and eosin, ×40.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Source control of urosepsis is the most crucial step. Treatment of urosepsis associated with obstruction and abscesses requires drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Physiological changes may occur due to the prone position maintained during the drainage, such as increased intraperitoneal pressure and reduced venous return, which can potentially induce complications such as hypotension, arrhythmia, and syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Accordingly, optimal BP must be maintained before such a procedure. In our case, UPJ drainage in the prone position was too invasive with poorly controlled BP after the initiation of norepinephrine. Hence, PMX-DHP along with the administration of hydrocortisone was selected in advance to the drainage. The effect of PMX on septic shock patients with different endotoxin levels is currently being investigated in a clinical study, the results of which are expected to come in 2022 (NCT03901807). It is known that norepinephrine, which is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-adrenergic agonist effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, is the first line of treatment for septic shock hypotension; however, our patient showed catecholamine-resistant hypotension with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. The use of corticosteroids and PMX improved hypoglycemia and hypotension simultaneously before using vasopressin.\n\n【16】ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are resistant to numerous β-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Major risk factors for colonization or infection with ESBL-producing organisms are antibiotic exposure, prolonged hospital stays, and admission in an institution with high rates of third-generation cephalosporin use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In the present case, the patient had a medical history of UTI treated with cefcapene pivoxil, a third-generation cephalosporin, and it was suspected that the bacteria were already resistant to those antibiotics; thus, we chose an empirical treatment with carbapenem.\n\n【17】Limited or delayed access to proper medical care is a severe confounder of mortality in rural areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Even the critically-ill patients in rural areas reach hospital after some delay due to the distance. Furthermore, patient transfer was not an option in our case. A harmonized and efficient initial management, including correct diagnosis, vital sign control, empirical antimicrobial treatment and additional adjunctive treatment, is crucial in such cases.\n\n【18】In conclusion, we report a case of urosepsis in a rural area hospital that achieved optimal initial management, which included norepinephrine with hydrocortisone, PMX-DHP, and empirical antibiotics, ultimately resulting in good prognosis.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【20】We thank Dr Yoko Kato, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, for reviewing this case report.

The coexistence of coeliac disease with cystic fibrosis is uncommon. Here, we describe the case of cystic fibrosis in a patient diagnosed with coeliac disease who failed to respond clinically to a gluten-free diet and had persistent steatorrhea and failure to thrive.\n\n【2】coeliac disease , cystic fibrosis , failure to thrive , steatorrhea\n\n【3】BACKGROUND\n----------\n\n【4】Coeliac disease (CD) is a malabsorption syndrome caused by gluten-induced small intestinal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The signs and symptoms of CD, such as malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and growth failure are nonspecific and may be difficult to distinguish from common symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 1938, Dorothy Anderson reported a syndrome which believed to be CD but described a distinct and separate pathology of CF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The coexistent disease should be kept in mind when the diagnosis is not clear or the patient is not improving on appropriate therapy.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 4-year-old Syrian male presented to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic with steatorrhea, failure to thrive, loss of appetite, and recurrent abdominal pain. Since early infancy, he suffered from feeding intolerance, diarrhea; he was passing stool up to 5 times/day, the stool was described as oily, bulky, and foul-smelling. No bilious emesis. He was on breast and bottle-feeding. By the age of 1 year, the family started seeking medical advice. Investigations were performed which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with fat globules in stool microscopy. The patient was treated with multivitamins without any improvement. He was a full-term infant delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.5 kg.\n\n【8】There is no significant familial history of genetic diseases or previous hospital admissions.\n\n【9】On physical examination, his body weight was 12.5 kg (−3.2 SD), the length was 95 cm (−2.5 SD). Vital signs were stable and he was generally well.\n\n【10】Laboratory analysis suggested iron deficiency anemia, with hemoglobin level (Hb) 8.9 g/L, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 68 fl, ferritin 17.4 ng/mL, serum iron 52.1 mcg/dL. Stool microscopy revealed fat globules.\n\n【11】Other laboratory tests that involved hepatic function, renal function, electrolytes, blood glucose, urine examination, thyroid-stimulating Hormone (TSH), Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), D-xylose, serological immunoglobulin were within the normal range. Anti-gliadin antibodies IgA, IgG (AGA IgA, IgG), Anti-tissue transglutaminase Antibodies IgA (anti-TTG IgA) were markedly elevated (more than 400 U/mL). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed that showed normal findings. The duodenal biopsies showed nonspecific changes as mild focal shorting of intestinal villi and elongation of crypts with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes range (30 lymphocytes/100 epithelial cells). That could not exclude CD (marsh 2).\n\n【12】Based on the clinical presentation and hematologic findings, CD was suspected. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet, vitamins, and iron supplements for 3 months with improvement in appetite and weight, and continued steatorrhea. Therefore, elastase in stool was performed which was markedly reduced. On genetic testing, he was homozygous (9 T/9 T) for the F508del (-CTT) mutation. The diagnosis of CD with CF was made, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) was initiated, at a dose of 1000 U/Kg/per day offered with ursodeoxycholic acid, multivitamins, folic acid, gluten-free diet, and high-calorie rates of 230% for his age. After about 5 months of treatment, his general situation was good with remarkable clinical improvement, normal stool, and weight gain of 4 kg.\n\n【13】We followed the patient for 6 years. During these years, the patient was re-referred to the clinic with abdominal pain and weight loss due to a gluten diet for 2 months. Anti-TTG IgA was elevated (more than 400 U/mL). The gluten-free diet was restored. Currently, the child is in good condition with a normal growth rate.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】The occurrence of the two diseases in the same patient was first described in 1969 by Hide and Burman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of both CD and CF is 1 in 2, 000, 000–1:5, 900, 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, around 30 cases of children have been reported in the literature. The underlying mechanism of the coexisting of two disorders still controversial. There are some hypotheses to explain the coexistence such as increased intestinal mucosal contact with the complete gluten protein due to pancreatic insufficiency in patients with CF. Besides, malnutrition might cause some additional mucosal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Some studies suggest an increased incidence of food allergy in CF patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Lots of common symptoms as malnutrition and malabsorption seem to unify these two diseases. That makes the diagnosis and the management of patients suffered from both of these two diseases more difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are specific diagnostic methods for each disease. In patients with gluten-dependent symptoms, the diagnosis of CD may be confirmed by elevation in the levels of antibodies specific for CD \\[AGA (IgA, IgG), anti-TTG IgA\\], and histopathological exam. There could be false-negative results in the levels of AGA IgA and anti-TTG IgA if the patient has IgA deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. As criteria for the diagnosis of CF, the presence of a family history of CF, phenotypical clinical condition, or positive newborn screening associated with the elevation of chloride concentration in sweat or identification of two mutations of CFTR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The coexistent disease should be kept in mind when the patient is not improving on appropriate therapy. Pediatricians must consider the investigation of CF in patients with CD, who have poor control of symptoms of malabsorption despite receiving adequate therapy.\n\n【17】As in our case, the dominant symptom was steatorrhea from early infancy resulting in failure to thrive. The diagnosis of CD was established with no improvement in treatment. Persistent diarrhea, reduced elastase in stool, and the mutation on genetic testing proposed the co-diagnosis with CF.\n\n【18】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【19】None declared.\n\n【20】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【21】No funding was obtained for this study.\n\n【22】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee Tishreen University Hospital, Latakia, Syria.\n\n【24】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【25】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

A 60-year-old male presented with impaired consciousness and convulsions due to SAH from a ruptured aneurysm. It was managed by endovascular coiling 20 h after the onset of symptoms. Serial brain imaging for 2 weeks revealed progressive bilateral SHs, more on contralateral side of leaking aneurysm. Management of SH was discussed in a multidisciplinary setting to be conservative as there was neither significant mass effect nor hydrocephalus. The patient recovered neurologically except for mild dysarthria. The SH persisted for 2 months and then cleared gradually. We concluded that SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subdural space can be described as ‘subdural hygroma’ (SH), ‘external hydrocephalus’ and ‘subdural effusion’.

However, SH is rarely reported after endovascular coiling for ruptured aneurysms.\n\n【14】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【15】The patient was a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco smoking. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute onset of headache and mild right-sided weakness. The patient had neither history of head trauma nor fever before the presentation. Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) of brain revealed extensive SAH. CT cerebral angiography revealed a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCA), 4.5 × 6 mm with neck 2–3 mm, and another internal carotid artery, para-ophthalmic, unruptured aneurysm on the right side. Hunt and Hess’s scale was 3, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14/15. The patient developed generalized tonic–clonic convulsion that was controlled by midazolam and kept on oral levetiracetam.\n\n【16】Endovascular coiling was performed 20 h after the onset of symptoms, and it was an uncomplicated technique. ICU management followed the standard protocol of SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】On the 5th day, GCS decreased to 11/15 and brain CT revealed the same degree of SAH and increased SH, but without any mass effect nor hydrocephalic changes. Transcranial Doppler to exclude cerebral vasospasm was requested but not done at that time due to technical problems.\n\n【18】No improvement was observed in the consciousness level, which deteriorated further. On the 10th day, GCS was 9/15 with worsened right-sided weakness (grade 2). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed right-sided sizable SH exerting mild mass effect and left basal ganglia ischemic focus. Multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) concluded that the patient had delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and significant SH with mild mass effect and recommended no intervention for SH.\n\n【19】At the end of the 2nd week, the consciousness level improved to GCS 11/15 and weakness was grade 3. Surprisingly, imaging revealed progressive right SH and new SH on the left side, but with no mass effect from either hygromas. Another MDM recommended continuing conservative management.\n\n【20】By the end of 1st month, the consciousness level was regained and right-sided weakness improved to grade 4 with mild dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed that SH had decreased. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center (RC) after 1 month of ICU stay.\n\n【21】Imaging after 2 months revealed that SAH was almost cleared, both SHs were still decreasing and a small left basal ganglia infarction. The patient was discharged home from RC without any residual weakness, fully conscious but with mild dysarthria.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】SAH is a serious medical condition with an increased fatality, an incidence of 9 per 100 000 and a fatality rate within 6 months of about 60%. In aneurysmal SAH, the three most important variables related to prognosis are the early neurological state, age and the degree of extravasation on imaging. Consciousness is the most important determinant for outcome after SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In 1932, Dandy described SH as a collection of nonblood fluid in the subdural space that can be encapsulated under a thin membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of SH is still unclear; however, two postulated mechanisms include a tear in the arachnoid membrane causing CSF influx or decreased intracranial pressure leading to passive effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Both external hydrocephalus and SH have unique clinical entities. External hydrocephalus is usually associated with disturbances in CSF flow caused by the imbalance between production and absorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Radiographically, external hydrocephalus and SHs are similar, but ventriculomegaly is the primary distinguishing criterion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Our case was managed by simple endovascular coiling through the femoral approach with the intervention of bleeding left PCA aneurysm (four coils were deployed), and the right one was postponed after complete patient recovery.\n\n【27】The serial imaging of our case never showed any ventriculomegaly during the course. This made it a unique case of SH post-coiling. A previous study reported a case of external hydrocephalus as it was associated with ventriculomegaly, which also complicated the course of coiling for ruptured aneurysm. However, the case remained asymptomatic and the collection resolved spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Subdural collections may be seen after clipping of ruptured aneurysmal SAH but rarely seen after coiling. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting alone is an effective and accepted procedure in post-clipping states. However, patients with subdural effusion that is not accompanied by hydrocephalus do not require subdural peritoneal shunt. When selecting the treatment for subdural effusion, it is important to consider the presence of hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The management strategies for cases of SH following aneurysmal SAH patients are still undefined. Close neurological observation is indicated to follow the progression of any mass effect or conversion into a subdural hematoma.\n\n【30】The management of our case regarding SH was challenging. The deteriorating consciousness level put more ambiguity on the clinical impact of SH due to the incidence of DCI at the same time of increasing size of SH and its mass effect. However, the absence of ventriculomegaly with a meticulous neurological assessment directed us to continue the conservative plan.\n\n【31】The etiology of the SH in the presented case is unknown as there was no history of head trauma at presentation, CSF diversion technique, nor craniotomy, which represent the potential causes for SH after SAH. Whether it is related to CSF flow dynamics post-occurrence of SAH or from a direct effect of coiling (although SH was mainly on the opposite side of bleeding aneurysm) is still to be defined.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【33】SH may arise and become symptomatic as an unusual sequela of post-coiling of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, in which the SH can complicate the clinical course of SAH. However, the symptomatic SH may resolve spontaneously and completely without any intervention, but needs meticulous neurological assessment and follow-up.\n\n【34】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【35】None.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】Informed written consent was taken from a first-degree relative.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】W.O.A. and M.E.A.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Within 40 min after symptom-onset, the patient was referred to the local cath lab. During coronary angiography, an occlusion of the left main (LM) coronary artery was observed with frustrating efforts of revascularization that lead to the decision for acute coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n\n【1】In the clinical picture of cardiogenic shock, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vaECMO) support was provided for bridging until CABG surgery.

Within TEE, a dissection of the ascending aorta (Stanford Type-A) was observed—a dissection flap was identified to be causative for the occlusion of the LM, resulting in the picture of STEMI . In addition, the dissection flap was found to inhibit aortic valve function, resulting in moderate aortic regurgitation (AR)—which mirrors an evident explanation for respiratory failure after initiation of vaECMO via flow-associated pulmonary fluid overload on the basis of an increased left ventricular afterload .\n\n【3】Figure 1\n\n【4】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【5】TEE identified a dissection flap which caused the occlusion of the LM coronary artery, resulting in the picture of STEMI ( **A** and **B** ).

Considering the present case, the early identification of AR could have avoided respiratory failure and subsequent hypoxia in this highly vulnerable patient.\n\n【7】Aortic dissection and/or severe AR mirror a contraindication for the initiation of mechanical circulatory support, since the backward flow from severe regurgitation may cause massive left ventricular volume-overloading. In this regard, ventricular venting is a mandatory intervention and should also be considered in case of mild AR to prevent ventricular distension after initiation of vaECMO. Therefore, a standardized TTE seems crucial before initiation of vaECMO-support.\n\n【8】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【11】None.\n\n【12】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【13】Not applicable.\n\n【14】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【15】Patient deceased—therefore a signed patient or guardian consent is not available.\n\n【16】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【17】Not applicable.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【19】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Here, I present a case of a 64-year-old female cook who attended the General Medicine clinic with 2 months of persistent numbness and ‘burning’ sensation over the right anterolateral thigh. Subsequent physical examination revealed the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. The significance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica cannot be overemphasized. In most typical presentations, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not add value to confirm the diagnosis. If the clinical diagnosis is doubtful, nerve conduction study and magnetic resonance imaging may still be performed to exclude other mimicking pathologies. Increasing awareness of MP among doctors unfamiliar with this condition will prevent the ordering of excessive investigations.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a disorder characterized by abnormal sensations such as tingling, burning pain or numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh due to the dysfunction of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The LFCN is a sensory branch of the lumbar plexus derived from the posterior divisions of the L2 and L3 spinal nerves. After emerging from under the lateral border of the psoas major muscle, the nerve courses inferolateral around the iliac fossa into a tunnel formed by the lateral attachment of the inguinal ligament and the anterior superior iliac spine. At the level of the inguinal ligament, the LFCN is susceptible to trauma and entrapment. As the nerve exits from the pelvis, it bifurcates into anterior and posterior branches, which provide sensation to the anterior and lateral thigh, respectively .\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old female cook at a childcare centre attended the General Medicine clinic with 2 months of persistent numbness and ‘burning’ sensation over the right anterolateral thigh. The symptoms were not aggravated by movement of the lower limb, and there were no relieving factors. She had no trauma to her back, right groin or thigh before the onset of symptoms. She had no backache, muscle ache or limb weakness. The bladder and bowel function were normal.\n\n【6】She had a history of minor back trauma > 30 years previously from which she made an uneventful recovery. She had well-controlled asthma on regular Seretide inhalers. She was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. Her general practitioner prescribed pregabalin 75-mg nocte and naproxen 275-mg twice daily to control the paraesthesia, but this offered her no relief.\n\n【7】Given the presenting complaint, a full neurological examination of the lower limbs was performed. She had no muscle wasting, and no deficits were elicited in tone, reflexes, power and coordination. The patient was able to demarcate a distinct area of paraesthesia on the anterolateral part of her right thigh. There were no overlying skin lesions on the paraesthetic area. Abdominal, inguinal and spine examinations were also unremarkable. She weighed 47.4 kg, and her body mass index was 23.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】The yellow line is the right LFCN. The green line is the inguinal ligament. The red shaded area is the area innervated by LFCN.\n\n【11】The clinical presentation and findings led to a diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. A nerve conduction study of both the right and left LFCNs showed similar values in the latency, amplitude and conduction velocity . Value differences of >50% from side to side is considered significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral plexus using the routine lumbar plexus protocol revealed mild focal swelling in the right LFCN proximal to the foramen beneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine, compatible with underlying meralgia paresthetica . The rest of its length on the MRI showed no abnormality. There were no bony or soft tissue abnormalities within the pelvic cavity. Further investigations revealed a normal full blood count, renal function, thyroid function, vitamin B12 level and HbA1c of 5.5% (Normal < 6.4%). When the patient was reviewed in the clinic 4 months after the onset of symptom, she reported the paraesthesia had resolved completely and spontaneously.\n\n【12】Table 1\n\n【13】Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【16】Open in new tab\n\n【17】Table 1\n\n【18】Lateral femoral cutaneous sensory nerve conduction studies\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n| Nerve tested . | Latency (ms) . | Amplitude (μV) . | Conduction velocity (m/s) . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right LFCN (lateral thigh) | 3.0 | 9.9 | 60 |\n| Left LFCN (lateral thigh) | 2.6 | 8.8 | 65 |\n\n【21】Open in new tab\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Axial T2 FS image shoes mild focal swelling in the right LFCN underneath the inguinal ligament adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a condition commonly seen in primary care, orthopaedic surgery, bariatric surgery, obstetrics and intensive care settings. It is less frequently encountered in a General Medicine clinic.\n\n【27】There are many causes of MP. Some mechanical causes include obesity, pregnancy, pelvic masses, wearing tight belts or trousers and orthopaedic procedures causing direct damage to the LFCN. Metabolic factors such as lead poisoning, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism are also associated with MP. In a series of 67 patients with MP, 10 patients (15%) had no associated condition, making idiopathic cause the second most frequent finding after obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although there was no apparent cause in our patient, the presence of focal swelling in the LFCN raises the possibility that recurrent microtrauma in her occupational role as a cook may have caused damage to the nerve pain fibres.\n\n【28】In this patient, the nerve conduction study (NCS) was reported as within normal limits. This finding is unsurprising because the NCS of the LFCN is often technically challenging to perform due to its anatomical position, the variations in its course, the presence of increased adipose tissue and the lack of a standard NCS protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In a retrospective, cross-sectional study from Korea, 26.9% of the patients with MP were found to have normal LFCN conduction study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This study suggests that NCS of the LFCN has a fairly low sensitivity in the diagnosis of MP and cannot be used as a substitute for a good history and appropriate physical examination. Nevertheless, an electrophysiological study may still be performed to rule out other mimicking diagnoses such as lumbar disk herniation and radiculopathy, especially if there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Traditional MRI is not routinely used to assess LFCN as signal intensity changes of small peripheral nerves are usually challenging to evaluate. It may be performed to exclude other conditions that may mimic MP such as metastasis in the iliac crest, lumbar disk herniation, lumbar radiculopathy and chronic appendicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–8 \\]</u>, and to identify other bony abnormalities that may cause compression along the course of the nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. With advancing technology, magnetic resonance neurography is increasingly being utilized to diagnose or exclude a neuropathy, assess the degree of nerve injury, characterize the culprit lesion causing nerve entrapment and aid radiological-guided injection of perineural medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the presence of neuropathy, the signal intensity of the injured nerve increases and is similar to the fluid-like signal intensity of the neighbouring vessels on T2 weighted imaging, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In conclusion, this case has highlighted the importance of good history taking and thorough physical examination in reaching the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. In most cases, advanced imaging and neurodiagnostic testing do not help make the diagnosis. Raising awareness of meralgia paresthetica among physicians unfamiliar with the condition will prevent the overuse of investigations.\n\n【31】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【32】I thank Professor C.

The development of tolerance and immunogical effects of these agents in people living with HIV are not well assessed as these persons are often excluded from clinical trials. Herein, we report a case of a Caucasian woman who received multiple sequential immunotherapies for severe ulcerative colitis. Due to steroid-refractory disease, receipt of maximal doses of mesalamine and initial repeated decline of surgical intervention, she went on to receive biologic immune inhibitors like tumor necrosis fator-α blockers infliximab and adalimumab, the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab, anti-interleukin 12/23 blocker ustekinumab and Janus Kinase inihibitor tofacitinib without achieving remission. Only minor infectious complications were encountered and no significant changes in CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio occurred. This case provides support for the safety and tolerability of the above immunotherapies in people living with HIV with suppressed viral load on antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】In the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), one provides immunosuppressive therapy with the hope of tempering excessive inflammation while preserving immune function. However, if the proper balance between immunosuppression and immune preservation is not achieved, an individual will be tipped into immunodeficiency with increased infection risk. People living with HIV (PLWH) are often excluding from clinical trials involving biologics based on concerns of additive immunosuppression and infection risk. Consequently, little data are available to guide clinicians in managing PLWH who suffer from advanced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, we present the case of young woman with HIV infection and extensive UC refractory to many therapies. Following repeated decline of surgical intervention, she was treated with multiple sequential immunomodulators and did not experience any major adverse effects.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old, Canadian-born Caucasian woman was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. She began antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil 300 mg/emtracitabine 200 mg orally once daily and raltegravir 400 mg orally twice daily in 2012, when her CD4 count rapidly dropped to 86 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Later that year, she began experiencing frequent episodes of bloody diarrhea, with up to 20 stools daily, with cramping, rectal bleeding and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Stool was repeatedly negative for _Clostridium difficile_ and ova and parasites. Colonoscopy demonstrated severe pancolitis and biopsies consistent with active UC with acute cryptitis, crypt abcesses with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal erosions, acute inflammatory exudate with architectural disortion. Hematoxylin and eosin stains for cytomegalovirus and histochemical exams for Herpes Simplex Virus I/II were negative. Despite high doses of oral prednisone (40–60 mg daily) and several emergency room visits to receive intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for flares, she was deemed steroid-refractory.\n\n【6】Later that year, she received maximum doses of oral mesalamine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as mesalamine suppositories and enemas. She then received infliximab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012–2013)</u>, an antitumor necrois fator-α (anti-TNFα) monoclonal antibody, until antibody formation. Despite maximum doses of adalimumab 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u>, her UC remained refractory although no antibodies were detected using a drug-tolerant assay and medication levels were therapeutic (>12 μg/ml, the highest limit of detection). Attempts to taper her steroids resulted in flare-ups and a cushingoid feature. She declined colectomy as she felt this would interfere with her lifestyle, especially since she was getting married, and concerns about her future fertility.\n\n【7】One of the options explored was the use of vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against α4β7 integrin, via a clinical trial. However, due to the patient’s HIV infection she was not eligible to participate in any of the recruiting trials at the centre as HIV infection is frequently an exclusion criteria. Colonoscopy in 2015 revealed severe inflammation with ulcerations and friability consistent with Mayo 3 colitis, despite high-dose steroids and adalimumab, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 80 mg weekly. By December 2015, vedolizumab was obtained through standard of care and initiated at 300 mg IV at weeks 0 and 2, 6 (loading dose) and then every 8 weeks thereafter as a maintenance dose. She was still bleeding from the rectum and had decreased weight, therefore daily prednisone 10 mg orally was maintained. She achieved clinical remission by March 2016 and steroids were stopped. Two months later, she developed right foot cellulitis following a minor trauma during a pedicure and required 48 hours of IV followed by oral antibiotics.\n\n【8】Colonoscopy in June 2016, 3 months after stopping steroids, showed worsening condition with Mayo 3 colitis, so she was changed to vedolizumab 300 mg IV q 4 weeks and prednisone increased to 40 mg orally (po) daily. Anti-α4β7 antibodies were not detected. She was passing bright red blood per rectum 12 times in 24 hours and having five stools per 24 hours with lower abdominal cramping and rectal pain. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinab 10 mg po twice daily, was initiated October 2016 and prednisone 40 mg po daily maintained. Symptoms persisted requiring admission for IV prednisolone, but she continued to decline surgical colectomy. She also developed a bacterial vaginitis treated with metronidazole cream and later a skin furuncle, treated with oral antibiotics.\n\n【9】Following tofacitinib, she received interleukin 12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab March–September 2017. She gained 30 pounds in 1 year (body mass index 37), increased abdominal fat and bilateral cataracts due to cortisone. Attempts to decrease prednisone below 30 mg daily led to bloody diarrhea (12–17 bowel movements daily). She eventually accepted to undergo subtotal abdominal colectomy 通用删除1(英):<u>(pathology shown in Fig. 1 )</u> with rectal stump and temporary end ileostomy by June 2018. She improved and was seen for follow-up a month post-op, at which time she was having increasing right lower quadrant pain and rising CRP. A computed tomography scan demonstrated collections in the subcutaneous fat surrounding the ostomy and a second collection centimeter with rim enhancement and fat stranding. These were drained and cultures grew _E. coli_ and _B. fragilis_ . She responded to IV antibiotics for 3 days followed by oral step-down antibiotics to complete 2 weeks. Eight months following her colectomy, she developed polyarthralgia in her interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, knees and feet with a normal CRP and a negative Rheumatoid Factor while off prednisone, thought to be either inflammatory or mechanical polyarthralgia. Pathology on surveillance sigmoidoscopy March 2019 demonstrated chronic active proctitis with ulceration consistent with chronic idiopathic IBD. Throughout this entire time, her CD4 range was between 400 and 900 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.41:1.12, and HIV viral load remained suppressed since November 2012.\n\n【10】**Figure 1**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Colonic resection histology. The colonic mucosa shows characteristic features of chronic ulcerative colitis including crypt architecture alteration, cryptitis, crypt abscess and focal mucosa ulceration. There is no evidence of dysplasia.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Due to repeated decline of surgery in order to preserve her quality of life and fertility, this woman with HIV and refractory UC received all available conventional therapies including mesalamine, glucocorticoids, thiopurines, antagonists to TNF- α, IL-12/23 blockers and anti-α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin. She also received a small-molecule JAK inhibitor. TNF-α inhibitors and α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blockers are used with extreme caution in PLWH due to concerns of additional immunosuppression and subsequent infection risk. However, during her 6 years of being on immunosuppressants, the patient only experienced one episode of cellulitis, bacterial vaginosis, a skin furuncle and peristomal abscesses, all of which were easily managed with traditional therapies. Another concern with the use of integrin receptor antagonists in PLWH, although rare, is the possibility of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy due to John Cunningham (JC) virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent blood plasma JC virus testing prior to vedolizumab initiation and this polymerase chain reaction testing was negative. She also denied any neurological signs or symptoms throughout treatment.\n\n【15】This woman’s case demonstrates that the spectrum of drug classes available and sequential use of biologics for treatment of UC were safe in this patient with well-controlled HIV infection ART, including an TNF-α blocker, JK inhibitor, IL-12/23 blocker and the α <sub>4 </sub> β <sub>7 </sub> integrin blocker vedolizumab. Our patient did not incur any significant changes in her CD4 count nor CD4/CD8 ratio during the course of her treatments and infections were relatively minor. Although we did not use combination biologics in this patient, their efficacy and safety for IBD and other and other inflammatory diseases associated was explored in a systematic review of observational studies which did not find any differences related to improvements in disease condition, adverse effects or infection rates in patients receiving combined treatment compared to placebo groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A clinical trial (NCT02764762) examining efficacy and safety of combined vedolizumab, adalimumab and oral methotrexate in patients with Crohn’s Disease is in progress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Until evidence from clinical trials is available on efficacy and safety of biologics and combination therapy in PLWH, case reports and case series provide a channel for dissemination of these experiences within the medical community.\n\n【16】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【17】The authors thank Pathologist, Dr Zu-hua Gao, for provision of the histology image.

Due to its rarity, interventionalists are less likely to be acquainted with angiography in this unique population. In the case of lesion ambiguity, different invasive diagnostic tools can be used to further evaluate lesion severity, including fractional flow reserve, instantaneous wave-free ratio and intravenous ultrasound (IVUS). In this case, we discuss the usefulness of IVUS as a beneficial tool in evaluation of angiographically ambiguous lesions due to foreshortening. Dextrocardia presents unique challenges to the interventional cardiologist secondary to difficulty in acquiring adequate views and unfamiliarity with mirroring of anatomy, and thus angiography can result in inaccurately assessed lesions. We demonstrate how IVUS can be used in evaluation of such lesions for more accurate evaluation, precision in stent placement and in turn better patient outcomes.\n\n【2】CASE DESCRIPTION\n----------------\n\n【3】A 71-year-old male with past medical history of complete situs inversus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, bilateral pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and self-reported ‘heart aneurysm’ was admitted to the hospital with crushing right-sided chest pain radiating into the neck beginning that morning, with accompanying palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness and hand numbness. He denied any prior history of coronary artery disease. Family history is significant for aortic aneurysm in his mother, who died of aneu-rysm-related complications at age 57. The patient had a 65-pack year smoking history. He was not taking anticoagulants at the time of admission. Electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block (RBBB), rate 71 beats per minute (bpm), QRS 136 milliseconds (ms), corrected QT (QTc) 491 ms, normal axis and no ischemia . Repeat EKG also exhibited RBBB, QRS 134 ms with T wave abnormalities, rate 75 bpm and QTc 482 ms . Computed tomography angiography chest with and without contrast showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or active disease. Troponins were positive, and rose from initial 0.06 to 2.766 maximum, then decreased to 2.167 over admission. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle cavity size with ejection fraction 50–55%, no wall motion abnormalities, and mild–moderate aortic valve regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed the day following admission. Approach involved a modified Seldinger technique and right femoral access as the brachial artery was too narrow. An ambiguous lesion of the right coronary artery (RCA) was seen on right anterior oblique (RAO) view, as seen in video 1 , and subsequently investigated using intravenous ultrasound technology (IVUS) . IVUS was chosen for its unique ability to provide real-time views of the intraluminal space allowing for better assessment of disease burden than angiography alone in intermediate and ambiguous lesions. The lesion was found to be an 80–90% occluded napkin-ring lesion of the proximal RCA. Video 2 demonstrates how the views were adjusted to account for mirroring, after which the lesion could be better appreciated . Without the use of IVUS, the lesion could have otherwise been underappreciated due to foreshortening secondary to unique anatomy of dextrocardia. PCI was performed using a 4.5 × 15 mm drug-eluting stent, and the patient was subsequently started on triple therapy consisting of apixaban, aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n【4】Figure 1\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Initial EKG 08.08.2021; initial EKG demonstrating sinus rhythm, QRS 136 ms, rate 71 bpm, QTC 491 ms, normal axis and no ischemia.\n\n【7】Figure 2\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Follow-up EKG 08.10.2021; repeat EKG demonstrating right bundle branch block, QRS 134 ms, T wave abnormalities, rate 75 bpm and QTc 482 ms.\n\n【10】Figure 3\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】RAO view of RCA showing ambiguity; RAO view of the right coronary artery showing intermediate lesion (black arrow).\n\n【13】Figure 4\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】IVUS view of RCA lesion; IVUS imaging of the RCA lesion demonstrating plaque morphology and stenosis of 80–90%.\n\n【16】Figure 5\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】RAO view with caudal angulation showing napkin ring lesion; adjusted RAO view with caudal angulation demonstrating extent of napkin-ring lesion of the RCA (black arrow).\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Situs inversus totalis, or situs inversus with dextrocardia, is a rare anomaly in which the internal organs are transposed oppositely as mirror images. It is believed these individuals have similar risk of coronary artery disease as the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The first report of coronary angiography in dextrocardia was in 1974, and the first report of PCI dextrocardia was in 1987 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Reports on PCI in this population have been limited, likely due to the low incidence of the disorder (1/10 000) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It can be difficult to identify myocardial infarcts in these patients, especially if dextrocardia presence is unknown, as presenting complaint may be right-sided chest pain with possible radiation to the right shoulder and arm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. EKG interpretation can also be misleading if dextrocardia is unknown at time of test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Guidelines for intervention are the same as in non-dextrocardia patients, but the operator must take into account the unique anatomical challenge that comes with transposition of the heart and coronaries to ensure optimal benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Coronary angiography is the gold standard to assess coronary stenosis. A stenotic diameter of >70% in non-left main artery (LMA) disease and _\\>_ 50% for LMA disease has been the standard for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Intermediate stenosis, defined as visual angiographic diameter stenosis severity between 40 and 69% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, creates a challenging question for the operator: is intervention warranted? The most recent guidelines of the American College of Cardiology support the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as invasive methods to assess the hemodynamic significance of intermediate lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. IVUS is an alternative intraprocedural diagnostic modality to evaluate such lesions. IVUS displays real-time views on plaque morphology providing valuable information on lesion severity as well as for stent placement and sizing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. IVUS’s cross-sectional intraluminal view provides significant advantage in assessment of ambiguous lesions when compared to the 2D x-ray projection of angiograms alone, and has been shown to yield superior outcomes, i.e. a decrease in incidence of under-expansion and incomplete apposition to the vessel wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In situs inversus, IVUS can be particularly useful, especially when the operator is unaccustomed to seeing reverse imaging of the heart and taking into consideration the anatomical issues that can present in ways such as lesion foreshortening.\n\n【22】Review of literature shows differing suggestions on angles for optimum viewing based on which vessel requires intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. Although our focus emphasizes the helpful use of technology for intermediate lesions in populations with unique anatomy such as dextrocardia, it is important to point out the differences in angiographic views. We comprehensively illustrate the vessel views in standard and mirrored form in Figs 6 and 7 . Note each angiographic camera angle is the same for discerning each respective portion of a coronary artery, the only difference being the views are mirror images of each other necessitating directionally opposite torquing for cannulation. For example, the catheter points toward the left side of the screen instead of the right when engaging the left coronary ostium in the left anterior oblique (LAO) view. The catheter points to the right side of screen instead of left side when engaging the RCA ostium in the LAO view. Standard catheters can be used, but manipulation must be in opposite direction for optimal management, i.e. counterclockwise rotation of catheter for RCA cannulation as compared to the standard clockwise rotation.\n\n【23】Figure 6\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Left coronary system angiography views: angiography views of left coronary tree: standard views are the angiographic views that would be seen in a patient with an anatomically standard position of the heart, on the anatomical left side of the thoracic cavity; dextrocardia views are those seen on angiography in a patient with dextrocardia, where the heart is on the anatomical right side of the thoracic cavity.\n\n【26】Figure 7\n\n【27】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【28】Right coronary system angiography views: angiography views of right coronary tree: standard views are the angiographic views that would be seen in a patient with an anatomically standard position of the heart, on the anatomical left side of the thoracic cavity; dextrocardia views are those seen on angiography in a patient with dextrocardia, with their heart on the anatomical right side of the thoracic cavity.\n\n【29】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【30】Thomas Vacek provided contributions in concept and outline design, knowledge of angiographical views, expert guidance in figure editing for accuracy, and approved final draft of manuscript.

This report presents the first case of complete resolution of GMPC following a 3-year course of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist alongside external beam radiotherapy for the concurrent treatment of unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. In addition to illustrating the imaging features of the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy on GMPC regression, this case provides evidence for considering ADT as an alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment option in patients in whom surgical treatment is either contraindicated or can be made less invasive by reducing the size of GMPC prior to its removal.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Giant multilocular prostatic cystadenoma (GMPC) is a rare benign tumor with <30 cases reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> since its first description by Maluf _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> in 1991. GMPC often manifests with obstructive urinary symptoms, urinary retention or pelvic pain. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice, however, not all patients are suitable for a surgical intervention, thereby presenting a case for alternative, noninvasive GMPC treatment options. In this report, we present the first case of a patient in whom GMPC was concurrently diagnosed with an unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), with both lesions showing complete resolution following a 3-year course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old male was referred to our center for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion for localized PCa with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 8.0 ng/ml. The biopsy revealed the presence of a Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 mixed ductal and acinar carcinoma of the prostate in 3/3 cores in the left base, which was later correlated to a 17 × 7 × 15 mm (0.96 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) PI-RADS 5 lesion on staging multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>** . mpMRI also demonstrated a multiloculated cystic lesion arising from the prostatic base and extending into the bladder, measuring 72 × 41 × 53 mm (81.9 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 2 **)</u>** . On the right side, the locules were of intermediate T2 signal with areas of restricted diffusion, likely relating to blood products. On the left side, the locules showed higher T2 signal with no restricted diffusion, and areas of low T1 or high T1 signal intensity, likely relating to either simple fluid or proteinaceous material, respectively. No imaging features of local invasion were observed, with the described radiological appearance being in keeping with GMPC. A subsequent flexible cystoscopy showed no invasion of the mass into the bladder, and no malignant cells were seen on diagnostic cytology. The patient was prescribed an LHRH agonist with a 3-month interval MRI demonstrating a significant reduction in size of GMPC, then measuring 43 × 29 × 40 mm (26.1 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 3 **)</u>** . The previously noted lesion in the left prostatic peripheral zone also appeared less prominent, measuring 11 × 4 × 9 mm (0.20 cm <sup>3 </sup> ). Following 6 months of ADT, the patient underwent hypofractionated EBRT with 60 Gy delivered over 20 treatment sessions. No MRI was performed immediately post-EBRT, however, the EBRT planning CT scan demonstrated even further reduction of GMPC, making it virtually undetectable **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 4 **)</u>** . Following EBRT, the patient continued on LHRH agonist for a further 2 years with his PSA remaining < 0.04 ng/ml. A routine surveillance MRI scan, performed more than three and a half years after initial treatment, showed complete regression of both GMPC and the previously identified left peripheral zone lesion, with the final gland volume being 10.6 cm <sup>3 </sup> **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 3 **)</u>** .\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Axial T2WI (a) and diffusion-weighted imaging (b), alongside apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping (c) of the pelvis.

No suspicious mass protruding into the urinary bladder was convincingly visible on anatomical imaging (a). The patient received intensity-modulated radiation therapy using 60 Gy Prostate (red 95% isodose) and 48Gy seminal vesicles (yellow 95% isodose) delivered over 20 sessions with daily image guidance (b).\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete regression of a GMPC following a three-year course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with EBRT for organ-confined PCa. The 4-fold reduction in the GMPC volume reported after the initial 3-month ADT, alongside its further reduction seen on EBRT computed tomography (CT) planning scan, highlight the key role of castration in the observed phenomenon, likely driven by targeting the androgen receptor, which is known to be expressed on GMPC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These findings are in line with the single published report of noninvasive treatment of recurrent unresectable GMPC with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which also demonstrated a positive result, with no further recurrence observed on continuous ADT. In the present report, interim EBRT could also have an add-on effect on GMPC resolution, e.g. by means of destroying its feeding vessel. Overall, these findings suggest that ADT is effective in treating both primary and recurrent GMPC, thereby serving as a promising alternative to invasive surgical treatment.\n\n【20】GMPC can be diagnosed at any age between 16 and 80 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with its presenting symptoms being similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including lower urinary symptoms, urinary retention, hematuria and elevated serum PSA levels. Radiologically, GMPCs present as large retroperitoneal masses located between the bladder and rectum, showing multilocular cavities and cysts of various sizes. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging may provide additional information on the presence and the nature of any GMPC soft tissue components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Being aware of radiological features of GMPC, alongside other pelvic masses or congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract, is of considerable clinical relevance given the increasing use of MRI for diagnosis, local staging and follow-up imaging of PCa, which may lead to a more frequent incidental detection of this rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Additionally, to our knowledge, the concomitant diagnosis of GMPC and biopsy-proven PCa demonstrated in this report has not been presented previously.\n\n【21】As there are no pathognomonic histopathological signs of GMPC that could enable its confident diagnosis by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, it is important to consider several differential diagnoses that include other lower male genitourinary tract cysts (Müllerian, prostatic, seminal vesicle and utricle), prostatic leiomyoma, lymphangioma, teratoma, liposarcoma, hydatid disease and phyllodes variant of atypical prostatic hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Given the size and possible adherence to surrounding organs, complete surgical excision of GMPC, which is required to prevent the disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, often becomes a traumatic operation with major complications being bladder and rectum perforation, pelvic abscess, anal canal injury and rectal leak 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. As evidenced by this report, a short-term ADT course may be used as a preoperative volume-reducing step aimed at decreasing the invasiveness of GMPC surgical removal. In cases when radical treatment is contraindicated or can be avoided due to the mild nature of GMPC-related symptoms, strong consideration should be given to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option capable of achieving complete GMPC resolution.\n\n【23】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【24】In conclusion, we reported the first case of complete regression of a GMPC observed on consecutive MRI scans following 3 years of ADT with an LHRH agonist. The reported observation warrants further attention to ADT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option for patients with GMPC in whom complete surgical resection is either contraindicated or can be deferred.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【26】No funding was received for this report.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【28】None declared.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】Ethical approval was not required.\n\n【31】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【32】Patient consent to publish the anonymized MR images was obtained in writing.\n\n【33】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【34】The guarantor of the study is Dr Tristan Barrett.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The literature shows increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects. We present a 57-year-old woman with stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma who received treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. She had disease progression on maintenance immunotherapy, confirming resistance. Palliative radiation to the sternal bone lesion resulted in a significant response to all areas of cancer, confirming the abscopal effect. Unfortunately, she developed severe pneumonitis; to our knowledge, this is the first case of abscopal lung toxicity.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The word abscopal was first used by Mole in 1953, meaning ‘at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The abscopal effect describes tumor responses outside the irradiated field, a rare phenomenon. A recent literature review of the abscopal effect between 1969 and 2014 detected only 46 cases, even though millions of patients are being treated worldwide with radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Local radiation plays a wide range of roles in cancer treatment and helps reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery, curative treatment and palliation of symptoms. Ionizing radiation (IR) causes DNA damage by several mechanisms, such as producing reactive oxygen species and DNA double-stranded breaks. The latter is the principal mechanism by which IR induces DNA damage. There is evidence of increased overall survival and response rates in patients receiving immunotherapy and radiation, likely from exaggerated abscopal effects, and several prospective studies are trying to study this phenomenon.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old female with a 37-pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department complaining of right-sided abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous liver with numerous nodules concerning metastatic disease. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 1.8 cm spiculated left upper lobe lung nodule, several lytic bone lesions and extensive hepatic metastatic disease .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Computerized tomography showing left lung spiculated nodule and multiple liver metastatic lesions.\n\n【9】A biopsy of the liver lesion showed nests and clusters of polygonal-shaped tumor cells with irregular nuclei and copious amounts of finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase stains revealed positive cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1. Tumor cells were negative for p40 and hep par-1 stains, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from lung primary. Laboratory data showed elevated liver enzymes and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Next-generation sequencing of the tumor revealed no actionable mutation, PD-L1 ˂1% with a tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 97th percentile. She started carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab with monthly denosumab injections. After four treatment cycles restaging scan showed a treatment response, and she continued maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months on maintenance therapy, the CEA started trending up, and she noticed worsening fatigue and sternal pain. Pemetrexed was discontinued to help with fatigue. A PET-CT scan showed significant progression with left upper lobe primary carcinoma, an extensive hepatic metastatic disease with most liver parenchyma replaced by tumor and progressive bone metastasis, including a large lesion in her sternal bone . She started palliative radiation for the sternal lesion and received 2500 cGy in five fractions while continuing pembrolizumab. Clinically she noticed significant resolution of sternal pain and fatigue and decided against changing systemic therapy. A total of 8 weeks after radiation, a bone scan revealed reduced activity in the sternum. However, a PET-CT scan surprisingly showed significant improvement in liver lesions  and a corresponding improvement in CEA. One month later, she was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and severe hypoxia, with CT showing evidence of pneumonitis . Grade 2 immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis was suspected, and immunotherapy was held. She received a tapering systemic corticosteroid regimen, steadily improving her symptoms. Immunotherapy was rechallenged per guideline-directed management (American Society of clinical oncology—Management of Immunotherapy Toxicity 2021). Unfortunately, rechallenging resulted in recurrent pneumonitis; hence, we discontinued treatment permanently. At her last follow-up, she appeared clinically well 6 months after stopping immunotherapy. A PET-CT showed no fluorodeoxyglucose activity in the liver, lungs and bones.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Positron emission tomography **(A)** Showing diffuse liver metastasis, lung nodule and a sternal bone metastatic lesion confirming disease progression. **(B)** Eight weeks of radiation therapy showing resolution of activity in the liver, lung nodule and sternal bone lesion.\n\n【13】Figure 3\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Computerized tomography showing areas of consolidation bilaterally consistent with pneumonitis.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The natural anticancer response is partly mediated by dendritic cells presenting new antigens to T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cancer cells evade the body’s immune response by impairing T-cell activity and dendritic-cell mediated stimulation of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1). T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors that overcome this include anti-programmed cell death protein 1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 monoclonal antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, commonly termed immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has been particularly promising in patients with high PD-L1 scores and higher tumor mutational burden 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had a high TMB, and she had an expected initial response to pembrolizumab. One of the crucial factors for the abscopal effect is the presence of infiltrating T cells; the higher presence has a positive association with the impact. Radiation therapy is well known to induce DNA damage which is believed to be responsible for triggering the immune system but is also a central mechanism for initiating the abscopal effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The damaged cells release neo-antigens that prime and activate the cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, which migrate and infiltrate the metastases outside the irradiated field, resulting in tumor regression.\n\n【18】A study of lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab showed improved survival when they had a history of previous radiation compared to patients who did not receive radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The PACIFIC trial evaluating consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients showed better survival outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy without significantly increasing immune-related side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In contrast, a study of patients with NSCLC treated with concurrent immunotherapy (durvalumab–tremelimumab) and radiation showed no significant difference in patients receiving different doses of radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Note that the patients in this study were pretreated with immunotherapy, and these findings raise doubts about radiation as a modality to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Despite contrary observations, our patient had an excellent abscopal response after palliative radiation and likely overcame immunotherapy resistance. Similar observations have been noted in multiple case studies. A unique feature of our case is diffuse pneumonitis that we firmly believe is an abscopal toxicity from systemic immune activation after radiation outside the lung. We described this unique phenomenon of distant effect as ‘abscopal toxicity’ (toxicity in the organ not exposed to irradiation field) since this finding is novel and has not been described in the literature. Our patient tolerated immunotherapy well without any side effects until she received radiation. Another critical factor is that our patient received palliative dose radiation to the sternum and never received radiation to the lung fields. We did not identify any case of abscopal pneumonitis in our literature search.\n\n【19】Regarding other abscopal toxicities, we found one other case reported in a patient exhibiting bullous pemphigoid after receiving palliative radiation while on treatment with nivolumab for renal cell cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We believe it is essential to be aware of abscopal toxicity as some of these toxicities can appear at a distant site and result in significant morbidity. Immunotherapy resistance is an area that needs timely research as many patients stop responding after some time. Although case studies like ours suggest radiation could overcome the resistance, there is a need for an accurate biomarker to identify patients who will benefit from this.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【27】Data is available on request to the corresponding author.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】No ethical approval required.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Aswanth Reddy, MD (Corresponding author).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Considering these clinical scenario infections, which are commonly diagnosed in India, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis and scrub typhus were thought of but autoimmune diseases were also kept in mind.\n\n【11】Complete hemogram revealed anemia (hemoglobin 9.2 g%), marked leukocytosis (90 400/cmm), thrombocytopenia (platelet 1 lac/cmm) and left shift on peripheral blood smear (neutrophils and band forms 70%, myelocytes 2%, metamyelocytes 10%, monocytes 2%, eosinophils 2%). She had normal serum electrolytes (serum Na+ 138 mEq/l, K+ 3.8 mEq/l) and renal functions (Ur 22 mg/dl, Cr 0.7 mg/dl). There was conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 7.6 mg/dl, direct/indirect 5.6 mg/dl/2 mg/dl), marked transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] 3552 U/l, alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] 4055 U/l) with normal serum albumin and globulin level on liver function test, which suggested acute hepatitis. There was coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT, 54.2 s) international normalized ratio (INR, 6.45) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, 34.2 s). Serum ammonia was 94.4 mcg/dl, which suggested of hepatic encephalopathy. She had lactate dehydrogenase (1032 U/l), C-reactive protein (32.2 mg/dl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm first 1 h) and procalcitonin was negative (0.4 ng/ml). Serum triglyceride was 176 mg/dl. Ultrasonography of abdomen showed increased liver echogenicity. Her blood and urine were sterile. Autoimmune workup like anti-nuclear antibody was negative.\n\n【12】She had towering liver enzymes with acute liver failure but serologically negative for hepatotropic virus (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus, hepatitis A virus). Serology for IgM dengue/IgM leptospira was negative. No malarial parasites were found on peripheral blood smear; Malaria Parasite Dual Antigen (MPDA) was also negative. But she had positive IgM for scrub typhus detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of brain was normal; cerebrospinal fluid study was done to rule out any central nervous system (CNS) infection, but it was normal.\n\n【13】Her drowsiness was explained by hepatic encephalopathy after ruled out all possible metabolic and septic causes of encephalopathy, CNS infection and vascular events.\n\n【14】For chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) was done, showing ST-depression on lateral leads predominantly (V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6, </sub> lead 1, Augmented Vector Left (aVL))  with elevated Troponin-T and Creatine Phosphokinase - MB (CPK-MB); there was global hypokinesia of left ventricle with ejection fraction 45% on transthoracic echocardiography, which suggested of myocarditis noninvasively supported by history of non-ischemic chest pain and normalization of ST-T changes, cardiac enzymes and echocardiographic findings later, after institution of disease directed treatment. Because of coagulopathy, with PT (54.2 s) INR (6.45) and aPTT (34.2 s), coronary angiography was not done.\n\n【15】Figure 2\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】ECG showing ST depression on lead I, aVL, V <sub>5, </sub> V <sub>6 </sub> .\n\n【18】For leukocytosis, to rule out myeloproliferative disorders, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done, which showed reactive marrow with myeloid: erythroid (M:E): 3:1 and no abnormal and hemophagocytic cells.\n\n【19】For reactive marrow and leukocytosis, we did leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score, it came out 110, which is high, so leukemoid reaction was confirmed. The patient was hemodynamically stable with ho history of hypotension; so this leukemoid reaction was not explained by hepatic necrosis.\n\n【20】Initially, the patient was treated symptomatically for acute liver failure and myocarditis. She was put on intravenous doxycycline for 14 days after positive scrub typhus report. The patient was improved gradually and became asymptomatic with normalization of liver enzymes (ALT 34 U/l and AST 28 U/l), thin-layer chromatography was 9800/cmm, cardiac enzymes (CPK-MB and troponin T) and ST-T changes on ECG on discharge and asked to take rest another few days, avoid strenuous activities and slowly increase exercise level.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Elevation of liver enzymes is common in scrub typhus but acute liver failure is rarely reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Presentation of chest pain with tachycardia and S <sub>3 </sub> gallop suggested myocarditis, which was confirmed by ECG findings (ST depression, T inversion) and elevated troponin T and CPK-MB. Myocarditis rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and postulated to be caused by localized infection in endothelial cells of heart and cardiac myocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Leukemoid reaction which, is very unusual following scrub typhus, can be explained as physiological response to overwhelming infection, which releases stimulatory molecules like growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT) ligand), adhesion molecules (CD11b/CD18) and various cytokines (interleukin-1, 3, 6, 8, tumour necrosis factor) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It often mimics hematological malignancy and could be differentiated by elevated LAP score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In a tropical country like India, scrub typhus serology should be done in acute febrile patient presenting with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis. Scrub typhus infection has an excellent therapeutic response to inexpensive antibiotic doxycycline within 5 days of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Early therapeutic intervention with doxycycline should be intensified in endemic countries.\n\n【25】Scrub typhus has emerged as a common etiology of febrile illness in Southeast Asian countries. It is underrecognized infection, which may present with serious complications like myocarditis and acute liver failure. Leukemoid reaction may be seen in scrub typhus like other triggering infections. In patients with acute febrile illness with acute liver failure and/or myocarditis, scrub typhus should be ruled out in all cases. Timely diagnosis of disease and therapy with doxycycline/or azithromycin leads to excellent prognosis.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】We would like to mention our gratitude to Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh, Head of Department, Department of Internal Medicine, IPGMER and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】None required.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】Prof. Dr Soumitra Ghosh.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

After pericardial drainage for drug-resistant right heart failure, she developed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and cardiogenic shock caused by severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Findings during emergency surgery included tricuspid valve (TV) junction failure caused by shortening of the chordae tendineae of the TV, which is an organic abnormality. Additionally, myocardial biopsy results revealed myocarditis. Although acute myocarditis developed with RV dysfunction, pericardial effusion suppressed venous return, which temporarily improved her pathological condition. However, RV dysfunction and severe TR were thought to have manifested after the venous return suppression was alleviated by pericardial drainage. Because venous return changes significantly after pericardial drainage, it is necessary to examine the need for drainage and re-evaluate the post-operative RV system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pericardial effusion suppresses venous return, which may conceal right ventricular (RV) or tricuspid valve (TV) dysfunction. If pericardial drainage is performed for such cases, then increased venous return may reveal RV dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and the risk of cardiogenic shock may develop. We present the case of a patient with shortened chordae tendineae of the TV in whom pericardial effusion concealed severe TR. Drainage revealed TR, which was accompanied by RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 63-year-old woman with no apparent history of rheumatic fever and cardiac diseases presented with general malaise and was hospitalized. On admission, her blood pressure and pulse were 120/87 mmHg and 60 beats/minute, respectively. The blood test revealed the following results: brain natriuretic peptide, 186 pg/ml (reference, 0–18.4 pg/ml); cardiac troponin I, 0.038 ng/ml (reference, 0–0.025 ng/ml); creatinine kinase (CPK), 228 U/l (reference, 29–248 U/l); CPK-MB, 30 U/l (reference, 5–25 U/l) and C-reactive protein, 2.69 mg/dl (reference, 0–0.14 mg/dl). Furthermore, an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a marked PQ duration of 0.48 msec; however, no ST-segment elevation was noted by an 18-lead ECG. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal cardiac function and pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the RV and 18 mm around the left ventricle (LV).\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】TTE at the time of admission; ( **A** ) Parasternal short-axis view: pericardial effusions of 7 mm around the right ventricle and 18 mm around the LV; ( **B** ) modified apical four-chamber view; TR insufficiency is unclear.\n\n【9】There was no obvious evidence of valvular diseases, including TR. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) revealed pericardial and thoracoabdominal effusions . On the day of admission, her hemodynamic status was stable and treatment was initiated with diuretics. However, the next day, her symptoms worsened and urine output was poor; therefore, pericardial drainage was performed to remove 320 ml of yellow and turbid pericardial fluid. The subjective symptoms improved thereafter; however, she experienced cardiogenic shock the day after treatment. TTE revealed that the TV ring diameter had enlarged from 33 mm (at admission) to 45 mm and that severe TR had developed . Emergency catheterization was performed to evaluate hemodynamics, coronary artery lesions and valvular diseases. Swan–Ganz catheterization revealed cardiac output, cardiac index and SvO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.35 l/min, 1.68 l/min/m <sup>2 </sup> and 45%, respectively. Increased right atrial pressure and an increased v-wave were also observed . Right ventriculography  revealed a 30% decrease in the RV ejection fraction and severe TR (Seller’s classification grade 3). The coronary artery and LV ejection fraction were normal, and mild mitral regurgitation was noted. Furthermore, a myocardial biopsy of the RV septum was performed. Despite insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, her hemodynamic status did not improve. Because of circulatory failure caused by severe TR, TV replacement (TVR) surgery was performed (27 mm; MAGNA MITRAL EASE Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Intraoperatively, the chordae tendineae of the TV were markedly shortened . Thereafter, a biopsy revealed T-lymphocyte infiltration and myocardial fibrosis . The patient was diagnosed with acute myocarditis. She was discharged 45 days after admission and remained free of cardiovascular events for the next 3 years.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Thoracic and abdominal CT performed at admission; ( **A** ) moderate pericardial effusion and right pleural effusion at the transverse section; ( **B** ) moderate pericardial effusion at the coronal section.\n\n【13】Figure 3\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】TTE after pericardial drainage; ( **A** ) apical four-chamber view: severe TR signal using Doppler echo with TV insufficiency during systole; ( **B** ) parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level: TV insufficiency during systole; a severe TR signal is noted secondary to TV insufficiency using Doppler echo.\n\n【16】Figure 4\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Right ventriculography image obtained in the 30° right anterior oblique view shows a 5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted via the right femoral vein approach; the contrast concentrations in the right ventricle and right atrium appear nearly identical.\n\n【19】Figure 5\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Intracardiac pressure waveform with a Swan–Ganz catheter; ( **A** ) the right atrial mean pressure is 15 mmHg; arrows indicate an increase in the v-wave height; ( **B** ) the RV systolic pressure is 34 mmHg, whereas the RV end-diastolic pressure is 15 mmHg; ( **C** ) the pulmonary artery pressure is 34/15 mmHg; ( **D** ) the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is 18 mmHg; ( **E** ) the LV systolic pressure is 123 mmHg, whereas the LV end-diastolic pressure is 20 mmHg; ( **F** ) the aortic pressure is 119/60 mmHg.\n\n【22】Figure 6\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Surgical findings during TVR; ( **A** ) arrows indicate the shortened TV chordae tendineae; ( **B** ) the arrow indicates the shortened TV chordae tendineae; the chordae tendineae were shortened to the extent that the papillary muscle and leaflet were almost attached.\n\n【25】Figure 7\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】Histopathological findings after RV myocardial biopsy; ( **A** ) infiltration of T lymphocytes and disappearance of cardiomyocytes are observed in some parts of the myocardial tissue; ( **B** ) enlarged image of the circled region in (A); vasculitis and fibrosis of the cardiomyocytes are observed.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】This case comprised underlying organic abnormalities of the chordae tendineae of the TV and incidental presentation with RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis. Pericardial drainage, which was performed as treatment, caused the TR and RV dysfunction to manifest and led to cardiogenic shock. Pericardial drainage reportedly causes preload variation before and after drainage in the right heart system, which is susceptible to pericardial cavity pressure; furthermore, the RV diastolic volume increases after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Compared to in the general population, the right heart system was more susceptible to venous return of this patient with shortened TV chordae tendineae, which led to the enlargement of the right heart system and severe TR caused by TV junction insufficiency. Acute myocarditis can be fatal, mainly because of pump failure and fatal arrhythmias secondary to LV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; however, RV dysfunction secondary to myocarditis alone can be serious in patients with organic abnormalities (such as TV tendon shortening). It should be noted that acute myocarditis causing only RV dysfunction may also cause hemodynamic instability.\n\n【31】Severe RV function and TV dysfunction have occurred after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our patient was at high risk because her symptoms worsened after admission and pericardial drainage was a priority. If the presence and severity of myocarditis could have been ascertained by gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; because of the possibility of acute myocarditis based on the presence of increased myocardial deviation enzymes and atrioventricular conduction delay on admission), then pericardial drainage might have been avoided. Colchicine administration is effective for pericardial effusion caused by pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, acute myocarditis was not diagnosed initially; TVR was performed to manage TV chordae tendineae shortening, which is an organic disorder. However, if the transient RV dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis had been an exacerbating factor, then medical therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would have improved the situation, and TVR might not have been necessary. For a previously reported case, medical therapy achieved an improvement in cardiogenic shock caused by RV dysfunction combined with TV dysfunction after pericardial drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Conversely, TVR still may have been necessary for the present case because of the tendon abnormality.\n\n【32】TR is classified as primary and secondary. Primary TR, a structural abnormality of the TV, accounts for ~8% of all TR cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; possible causes include Epstein’s malformation, infective endocarditis, pacemaker leads, chest trauma and rheumatic fever. Conversely, congenital TR with structural abnormalities but without a history of these conditions has also been reported; some cases have been diagnosed at an advanced age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Our patient likely had congenital TR.\n\n【33】Pericardial drainage is necessary for the treatment and identification of the cause. If the TV involves an organic abnormality (as in this case), or if acute myocarditis has spread to the RV, then venous return will have a strong, negative hemodynamic effect. Screening with MRI and TTE may help reduce the risks of TR and RV dysfunction after pericardial drainage.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】None declared.\n\n【36】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【37】None.\n\n【38】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【39】Institutional review board approval was not required for this case report.\n\n【40】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【41】Written informed consent for the publication of this case was obtained from the patient.\n\n【42】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【43】Higuchi Motoaki.\n\n【44】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【45】We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

To date, multiple different clinical features of actinomycosis have been described, as various anatomical sites (such as face, bone and joint, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, digestive tract, central nervous system, skin and soft tissue structures) can be affected. Of note, in any site, actinomycosis frequently mimics malignancy, tuberculosis or nocardiosis, as it spreads continuously and progressively, and often forms a cold abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Pulmonary actinomycosis (PA) is a rare but challenging diagnosis to make. PA is commonly confused with other chronic suppurative lung diseases and with malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Compared to cervicofacial actinomycosis, which is the most frequent form of actinomycosis and constitutes 50–60% of the total actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, PA is more difficult to treat due to inapplicable surgical incision and drainage and a high relapse rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Here, we report the case of a patient who complained of persistent coughing and a mild fever at her first visit. Chest radiograph revealed a mass-like consolidation in the right middle lung field. After exacerbation of both consolidation and opacity, bronchial brushing with bronchoscopy revealed actinomycosis.

She had noticed a mild fever 2 weeks before the visit. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had a 12-pack-year smoking history and a 20-year history of persistent alcohol use with daily use of beer (298-g alcohol units per week). Her physical examination at our office visit was unremarkable.\n\n【15】The baseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 9200/μL (neutrophils 76.0%, lymphocytes 20.9%, eosinophils 0.2%); hemoglobin, 11.9 g/dL; platelet count, 325 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; blood urea nitrogen, 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.52 mg/dL; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; chlorides, 104 mEq/L; total protein, 6.8 g/dL; albumin, 3.6 g/dL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 3.36 mg/dL (↑); total bilirubin, 0.30 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 162 IU/L; glucose, 120 mg/dL (↑); hemoglobin A1c, 5.1%; carcinoembryonic antigen, 2.7 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 13.7 U/mL; _Chlamydophila pneumonia_ immunoglobulin A, 1.8 (↑) (0.0–0.9); _Chlamydophila pneumonia_ immunoglobulin G, 3.3 (↑) (0.0–0.9); and beta-D-glucan, 2.2 pg/mL. Urinary pneumococcal and _Legionella_ antigens were negative.\n\n【16】Chest radiograph revealed a mass-like consolidation in the right middle lung field with a poorly marginated, increased opacity in the right lower lung field . A computed tomography (CT) scan of the lung field revealed no underlying pulmonary disease except for consolidation in the right middle lobe as shown in Video 1 of the Supplementary material. The patient was treated with 400 mg/day of garenoxacin (GRNX) for 2 weeks after her refusal of bronchoscopy. Although the mass-like consolidation slightly decreased in size , it rather increased 2 weeks after GRNX treatment . WBC count and CRP also increased up to 12 100/μL (↑) and 9.68 mg/dL (↑), respectively. Bronchoscopy was performed after acceptance of an informed consent of the examination.\n\n【17】**Figure 3**\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】HE stain of specimen obtained by bronchial brushing with bronchoscopy at right B4, showing a gram-positive filamentous branching organism, indicating _Actinomyces_ (magnification, ×1000).\n\n【20】**Figure 4**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】( **a** ) Chest radiograph (postero-anterior view) revealing the decreased but remaining consolidation in the right middle lung field at 3 weeks of PCG treatment.

A total of 20 million units/day of benzylpenicillin (PCG) had been applied to the patient. At 2 weeks of PCG treatment, WBC counts and CRP were normalized, while the consolidation in the middle right lung field had shrunk but remained even 3 weeks of PCG administration . Finally, thoracoscopic resection of the right middle lobe was performed after 4-week PCG treatment upon the acceptance of an informed consent of the surgery.\n\n【27】Histopathology of the resected lobe showed necrotic tissues surrounded by inflammatory granulations. The necrotic tissues included sulfur granules  that comprised filamentous rods of _Actinomyces_ .\n\n【28】The patient received 6 months of oral amoxicillin following surgery. PA has not relapsed ~1.5 years after the surgery .\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【30】The peak incidence of PA was reported to be in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Men were more often affected than women, with a 3:1 ratio. PA mainly resulted from aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal secretions. Consequently, individuals with poor oral hygiene, preexisting dental disease and alcoholism had an increased risk for developing PA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These factors were likely to be predispositions of PA in our case. In fact, the patient had 15 treated teeth of total 26 teeth and 1 untreated cavity of a right maxillary cuspid, in addition to a 20-year history of persistent, daily alcohol use.\n\n【31】In the literature, a rate of treatment failure and recurrence of PA after antibiotics treatment was 15.1%, while that after surgical resections was 6.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, durations of antibiotic treatment were recommended to be individualized, and termination of treatment could be considered 1 or 2 months after complete clinical and radiological disease resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Early good responses to antibiotics could predict a successful treatment outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, surgical interventions including surgical drainage are important for a complete cure of PA, which might shorten the duration of antibiotics treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Of note, a patient with relapses of PA was reported to take ~4 years of antibiotics treatment with a refusal of surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our case, both GRNX and PCG treatments were insufficient for a complete resolution of the lung lesion . PCG was effective for decreasing the size of the affected area but was not for the region of a right hilar nodule . Fluoroquinolones are usually considered to be inactive, but data are limited and controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. _In vitro_ studies showed that GRNX was effective for _Actinomyces_ spp. (0.5 and 1 mg/L of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50; see 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, respectively), although MIC50s of GRNX for _Actionomyces_ spp. were much higher than that for other anaerobic organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is still limited to determine whether GRNX is effective for a complete resolution of PA due to a short duration of the GRNX treatment and the involvement of necrotic tissues including sulfur granules  in the lung lesion in our case.\n\n【33】In summary, although PA was a challenging diagnosis to make, surgical intervention combined with intravenous and oral penicillin made a good recovery.\n\n【34】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【35】The authors thank Dr Takahiro Tuji, Department of Pathology, Sapporo City General Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, for performing histopathology for a surgically resected right middle lobe of the patient.\n\n【36】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【37】None declared.\n\n【38】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【39】There is no source of funding to report for this case report.\n\n【40】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【41】No ethical approval was required, as this was a clinical case.\n\n【42】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【43】Patient permission was obtained in writing.\n\n【44】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【45】Dr Toshiki Ito.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In the second-line setting, the JAVELIN trial demonstrated that avelumab (anti-PD-L1) had objective response rates of 33%, with 74% of responses lasting more than 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, leading to immunotherapy becoming a mainstay of treatment. In patients with a pre-existing autoimmune condition, the risks of a flare in the autoimmune condition need to be carefully weighed against potential cancer control. There is scant evidence regarding the use of immunotherapy in patients with pre-existing myasthenia gravis (MG).\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 79-year-old gentleman presented in December 2018 with a rapidly growing right parotid mass that was通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) avid. Core biopsy demonstrated a high-grade tumour with neuroendocrine differentiation favouring metastatic MCC of unknown primary. He completed definitive intent radiotherapy (63 Gray in 30 fractions) in April 2019. Repeat FDG-PET in July 2019 demonstrated marked decrease in size and avidity of the parotid lesion, though a new hypermetabolic liver lesion was detected. Liver biopsy demonstrated metastatic MCC similar to the original core biopsy specimen. He underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (30 Gray in 3 fractions) to the liver lesion and subsequent FDG-PET demonstrated decreased avidity in the liver and new sites of disease .\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Serial FDG-PET imaging as presented with serial maximal intensity projections (MIPs). ( **A** ) (Jan 19): FDG avid lesion in the right parotid (arrow). ( **B** ) (Jul 19): Avidity in treated right parotid lesion is decreased, but there was interval development of a new hypermetabolic segment VII hepatic lesion. ( **C** ) (Oct 19): Avidity in the hepatic and parotid lesions is decreased, but there were multiple new sites of FDG avidity concerning for disease progression including a right superficial infrascapular mass, SUVmax 10.5 and a left para-aortic node level of T8, SUVmax 5.1 (and a smaller node posterior to this SUVmax 2.6). There are also multiple new abdominal masses, most prominently inferior to the duodenum, SUVmax 8.8, and several mesenteric and peritoneal (LHS > RHS) avid nodules with SUV max up to 9.5.\n\n【10】Our patient had MG diagnosed in June 2018 after developing progressive weakness with normal creatinine kinase, positive ACh-R-Ab and confirmatory single-fibre electromyography. This was managed by his neurologist with prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and mycophenolate . He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002, which was treated with definitive radiotherapy, and he remained in remission as confirmed with persistently negative prostate-specific antigen making a paraneoplastic MG highly unlikely. He mobilized with a walking stick, required some assistance with personal care, but had greater subjective sense of fatigue than clinical fatigable weakness from MG.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Timeline of the Ach-R-Ab titre alongside the main treatments of MCC, immunosuppressive agents used and timing of the radiographic restaging scans.\n\n【14】His通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>68 </sup></u> Ga-DOTATATE PET scan revealed multiple sites of DOTATATE non-avid, FDG avid MCC and thus PRRT was not a therapeutic option. Due to concerns of giving immunotherapy with his underlying MG, he proceeded with single-agent carboplatin (rather than carboplatin/etoposide due to his functional status) in November 2019. The chemotherapy was ceased in January 2020 due to thrombocytopenia and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status dropping to 2. Repeat computed tomography (CT) in February 2020 demonstrated progressive intra-abdominal disease as well as a cerebellar lesion for which he received stereotactic radiosurgery. Discussion was conducted by both the oncologist and neurologist with the patient regarding the risk of avelumab exacerbating his MG event to the point of death weighed by the fact that there were no other remaining treatment options. There was also a precedent case report successfully maintaining IVIG to control autoimmune disease concurrently with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Given his desire to continue systemic treatment, he opted to proceed. After his first dose, he reported subjective fatiguability but was managing at home with no respiratory or swallowing issues. He had a progression-free survival (PFS) (from treatment initiation to progression of MCC) of 4 months . When CT in August 2020 showed progressive disease in two bilateral para-renal masses, he underwent five fractions of external beam radiotherapy to these lesions. They reduced in size initially, but CT in January 2021 demonstrated significant progressive disease, which led to cessation of avelumab . He had no increase in dyspnoea and neurology review found no evidence of MG flare. He was treated with best supportive care and died in February 2021.\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Serial CT imaging (Feb 20, May 20) demonstrating effect of immunotherapy on para-aortic and retrocrural lymph node.\n\n【18】Figure 4\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Areas of disease and their response to treatment (on CT).

As the use of immunotherapy continues to rise, it safety and effect in patients with pre-existent autoimmune conditions are increasingly relevant.\n\n【23】The AIM-NIVO trial assessing the efficacy of nivolumab in patients with autoimmune disorders and advanced malignancies is due to be completed in 2022 which will increase our data in these patients, though we note MG is not included in this cohort. In a literature search, we found 27 cases of immunotherapy-related MG. A 2017 review reported 23 cases; 72.7% were _de novo_ MG, 18.2% were exacerbations of pre-existent MG and 9.1% were exacerbations of subclinical MG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. There are four further published case reports, one with a partial response with no flare of MG and three cases who experienced a myasthenic crisis in the setting of immunotherapy treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In a 2017 study of 52 patients on immunotherapy, 38% of patients with an underlying autoimmune disorder subsequently had a flare of their disorder. Of the patients who had a flare, 60% had active disease at time of treatment and 50% were on immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. As titrated by his neurologist, while on immunotherapy, our patient was on a relatively low dose of prednisolone and while the cessation of mycophenolate was possible, escalation of IVIG was required. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that patients on immunosuppression at the start of anti-PD-1 treatment had lower response rate, PFS and overall survival compared to those not on immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. For our patient, the prednisolone and IVIG concurrent throughout the avelumab theoretically could have decreased the effect of the avelumab. However, there is a precedent case report whereby a patient with underlying Guillain–Barre syndrome was maintained on IVIG while achieving durable complete response of their metastatic colon cancer with pembrolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In the second-line setting, in line with the JAVELIN trial, our patient had 4 months of PFS on avelumab compared to median PFS of 61 days seen with second-line chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As such, rather than an autoimmune condition being a contraindication to immunotherapy, more data are needed to guide the immunosuppressant agents and doses, which can be used concurrently to enable therapeutic options for cancer, especially when all alternative options have been exhausted.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】None declared.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】Consent sought from patient.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Written consent has been received from patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Asymptomatic cases may develop into symptomatic pulmonary hydatidosis due to the rupture of hydatid cysts. _Lophomonas,_ as causative agents of pulmonary lophomoniasis, is an emerging protozoan that mostly infects the lower respiratory airways. Clinical symptoms of these two diseases can mostly be overlapped. Herein, we describe the rare case of comorbidity of a ruptured cystic echinococcosis and lophomoniasis in a 38-year-old male farmer with a history of opium addiction from northern Iran.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hydatidosis is a parasitic and zoonotic infection caused by the larval stage of _Echinococcus granulosus_ ( _Taeniidae_ family). Most reports of hydatidosis in humans have been due to infection with _E. granulosus_ (cystic echinococcosis) and _Echinococcus multilocularis_ (alveolar echinococcosis). _E. granulosus_ is very common in countries where agriculture and animal husbandry are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–2 \\]</u>. Humans can accidentally become intermediate hosts by ingesting tape worm eggs. Cysts of this parasite involve almost all the tissues of the human body, especially the liver, lungs, spleen and kidneys. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, about one million people worldwide are infected with cystic echinococcosis (CE) each year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is expected to be more prevalent in rural areas of developing countries where the main occupation is animal husbandry and farmer. Iran (mostly western areas) is a hyperendemic region for CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Imaging findings such as complemented by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are generally very useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Also, different serological tests can support the diagnosis of CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since most cases of CE are asymptomatic, uncomplicated cysts on chest radiography are usually seen as round lesions, but complications such as infection and perforation may alter the radiographic appearance of the CE and make it difficult to diagnose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Asymptomatic cases may develop into symptomatic pulmonary hydatidosis due to the rupture of hydatid cysts. Cyst rupture can occur spontaneously or as a consequence of trauma, and in some cases, a severe cough can rupture the pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It has previously been reported that co-infection of human CE with bacterial, viral and fungal infections has occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_Lophomonas_ is a flagellated extracellular and emerging protozoan that infects the lower (mostly) and upper respiratory tract. This protozoan is found commensally in the lower intestines of cockroaches and termites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The main symptoms of a _Lophomonas_ infection include cough, sputum and shortness of breath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. So far, several cases of co-infection with lophomoniasis and other infectious diseases in the world have been reported. But there is no evidence of lophomoniasis and CE co-infection in the world. Herein, we describe the first case of concomitant infection of a ruptured CE and lophomoniasis from northern Iran.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 38-year-old male farmer with a history of opium addiction was referred to an emergency ward in northern Iran with symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, cough with massive sputum, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, weakness and lethargy. The patient was immunocompetent with any history of underlying disease. He had a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg, a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, a temperature of 37.8°C and an oxygen saturation (SO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 94% on examination. On chest examination, decreased breath sounds were noted on the left hemithorax, but there was no organomegaly in the abdomen. The results of his laboratory findings are shown in Table 1 .\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】An axial chest CT scan shows a thick-walled cystic lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung. It contains internal membranes in its dependent portion with associated bilateral patchy ground glass opacities, indicative of a ruptured hydatid cyst.\n\n【11】Table 1\n\n【12】Baseline laboratory results\n\n| Parameter . | Value . | Reference value . | Unit . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC | 17 | 5000–15 000 | ×10 3 /micL |\n| RBC | 4.9 | 4–5.2 | ×10 6 /micL |\n| Eosinophil | 37 | 0–6 | % |\n| Lymphocyte | 15 | 20–50 | % |\n| Neutrophil | 47 | 40–70 | % |\n| Basophil | 1 | 0–2 | % |\n\n| Parameter . | Value . | Reference value . | Unit . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC | 17 | 5000–15 000 | ×10 3 /micL |\n| RBC | 4.9 | 4–5.2 | ×10 6 /micL |\n| Eosinophil | 37 | 0–6 | % |\n| Lymphocyte | 15 | 20–50 | % |\n| Neutrophil | 47 | 40–70 | % |\n| Basophil | 1 | 0–2 | % |\n\n【15】Open in new tab\n\n【16】Table 1\n\n【17】Baseline laboratory results\n\n| Parameter . | Value . | Reference value . | Unit . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC | 17 | 5000–15 000 | ×10 3 /micL |\n| RBC | 4.9 | 4–5.2 | ×10 6 /micL |\n| Eosinophil | 37 | 0–6 | % |\n| Lymphocyte | 15 | 20–50 | % |\n| Neutrophil | 47 | 40–70 | % |\n| Basophil | 1 | 0–2 | % |\n\n| Parameter . | Value . | Reference value . | Unit . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC | 17 | 5000–15 000 | ×10 3 /micL |\n| RBC | 4.9 | 4–5.2 | ×10 6 /micL |\n| Eosinophil | 37 | 0–6 | % |\n| Lymphocyte | 15 | 20–50 | % |\n| Neutrophil | 47 | 40–70 | % |\n| Basophil | 1 | 0–2 | % |\n\n【20】Open in new tab\n\n【21】Figure 2\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】A wet smear prepared from a BALF specimen showing motile and live _Lophomonas_ trophozoite (head of arrow) (400×).\n\n【24】The patient requested a spiral lung CT scan and was admitted to the lung service due to a space-occupying mass (measuring about 60 × 40 mm <sup>2 </sup> ) on the left lower lobe of lung. An axial chest CT scan revealed a thick-walled cystic lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung. It contains internal membranes in its dependent portion with associated bilateral patchy ground glass opacities, suggestive of a ruptured hydatid cyst.\n\n【25】Unfortunately, the patient suffered from severe coughs in the ward, and as a result, his general condition worsened. Due to severe cough, the patient was sedated with midozolam and underwent emergency fiber optic bronchoscopy, and a broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed. Then, two BALF samples were submitted to the hospital laboratory to rule out (R/O) BK (Bacillus of Koch) and fungal infections. A BALF specimen was also submitted to the Iranian National Registry Center for Lophomoniasis, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, to rule out _Lophomonas_ infection. Furthermore, a serological test for CE was requested to rule out CE. Finally, the result of the lab tests was as follows:\n\n【26】Fungal infection and tuberculosis were ruled out in the BALF samples. Besides, on microscopic examination of the BALF specimen under a light microscope, a number of live and oval-flagellated _Lophomonas_ protozoa were observed. Also, hydatid cyst protoscoleces (the larval forms of the parasites) were accidentally observed during microscopic examination. Furthermore, anti- _Echinococcus_ antibodies were detected in the patient’s serum.\n\n【27】Finally, the patient was treated with metronidazole (15 mg/kg; IV; for 2 weeks) to treat the _Lophomonas_ infection. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good general condition and with oral medication prescriptions after receiving albendazole tablets in several 1-month oral doses (10–15 mg/kg/d) separated by 14-day intervals for 6 months. One month after starting medical therapy, the patient underwent a minimally invasive thoracoscopic procedure to remove the cyst. A CT scan 6 months after receiving the treatment was requested to follow up on the response to the treatment. After that, the cystic lesion was resolved and the patient had no symptoms thereafter (data not shown). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. Also, CARE guidelines and methodology were followed in this study. The report was approved by ethical committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (IR.MAZUMS.IMAMHOSPITAL.REC.1398.002).\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】Hydatidosis usually involves the two main organs of the body: the lungs and liver. The lung is the second most common organ after the liver in hydatidosis. Cysts grow easily in elastic tissues such as the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. CE is always at risk of rupture and anaphylactic shock. About 3–17% of cases of hydatidosis lead to cyst rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Coughing, trauma and increased cyst size along with increased pressure inside the chest can lead to rupture of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Zakariai et al. presented a young woman with symptoms such as cough with excessive sputum, shortness of breath, salivation, nausea and vomiting with evidence of a large space-occupying lesion in the right lung with a diagnosis of CE. Unfortunately, following a severe cough in the patient, the CE ruptured, and she died of anaphylactic shock despite appropriate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our report, the patient’s cough, shortness of breath and chest pain were the main complaints. These symptoms may be mildly seen in intact CE. However, after entering the ward, he suffered from frequent and severe coughs, after which the pulmonary cyst ruptured and the contents of the cyst entered the bronchial space. Cavitary pulmonary lesions (CPL) occur in some different diseases, such as malignancies, infectious lung diseases and rheumatic disorders. On radiographic assessment of patients with pulmonary CE, several studies have shown evidence of CPL.\n\n【31】Recently, Taheri et al. reported that, for the first time, evidence of CPL was reported in the left lung of a patient with pulmonary lophomoniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Another causative agent of CPL is _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . According to the WHO report in 2020, tuberculosis is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. On clinical examination, it is impossible to distinguish between a ruptured hydatid cyst and lophomoniasis, and the clinical symptoms of both are frequently the same, ranging from chronic cough with or without sputum to chest pain, shortness of breath and sometimes hemoptysis. Therefore, examination of imaging findings can help in a better diagnosis of these diseases. It is noted that the lophomoniasis does not have pathognomonic radiological as well as bronchoscopic findings, and their findings are non-specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Some microbial infections have been associated to pulmonary hydatidosis in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, there have been no reports of _Lophomonas_ and CE co-infection. In the COVID-19 pandemic, however, _Lophomonas_ co-infection with other lung infections has been described. Using a molecular technique, Nakhaei et al. reported a co-occurrence of _Lophomonas_ infection in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The antibiotic metronidazole, at a dose of (500 mg three times a day for 2 weeks) orally or by injection (15 mg/kg 10 days) (in critical cases) for 2 weeks, is the standard treatment for lophomoniasis infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) can cause disease in immunocompromised patients as an opportunistic infection. To date, one co-infection of _Lophomonas_ with IPA has been reported in one immunocompromised patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> and several IPA cases have co-occurred with pulmonary CE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is noted that in some cases of pulmonary hydatidosis, such as mediastinal hydatidosis, a malignancy presentation may be mimicked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【34】Due to the similarity of clinical symptoms of lophomoniasis and hydatid cyst, it is highly recommended that physicians should consider _Lophomonas_ infection as an emerging and co-morbidity particularly in hydatid cyst endemic areas such as Iran. If CE is suspected, medical treatment should be started immediately because there is a possibility of pulmonary CE rupture following severe coughing and anaphylactic shock and death will occur.\n\n【35】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【36】Declared none.\n\n【37】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【38】None declared.\n\n【39】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【40】None.\n\n【41】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【42】This research was approved by the research ethics committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (IR.MAZUMS.REC.1397.2969).\n\n【43】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【44】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\n\n【45】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【46】M.F. and M.H.T.J. were involved in the interpretation and collecting of data the manuscript.

Dysfunction of TIVAP is not uncommon in clinical practice in cases of several etiologies. Herein, we report a rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to a catheter that migrated into the pleural space. Case presentation: We present a case of a 70-year-old man of TIVAP dysfunction due to a rare catheter extra-vascular migration into the pleural space, diagnosed by computed tomography. We decided on observation without further utilization of the TIVAP and a shift to oral chemotherapy, after a discussion with patient and his primary care oncologist. Conclusion: Our case highlighted the importance of proper evaluation of TIVAP catheter location before its usage or replacement.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used as a reliable route for chemotherapy, transfusions or parenteral nutrition support. Dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of TIVAP. The etiologies described in the literature include venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter obstruction, catheter disruption or dislocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Herein, we report the rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to catheter migration into the pleural space.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man presented to the vascular surgical outpatient clinic with TIVAP dysfunction. He received TIVAP (8-Fr Polysite silicone catheter in 2018, Perouse Medical, Ivry-Le-Temple, France.) implantation more than 3 years ago. He had received monthly 80 mg intravenous docetaxel treatment for left lung squamous cell carcinoma after the TIVAP implantation. As patient’s statement, he has dry cough before diagnosed of lung squamous cell carcinoma and persistent during the course of chemotherapy. Obstruction of the device occurred during blood aspiration though a smooth intravenous push was reported by nursing staff in the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea had developed hours after infusion of chemotherapeutic agents in the past 6 months. On examination, the port was well fixed, with a fair depth of puncture. Migration of the catheter tip was found by plain film check-up , compared with the image obtained 6 months ago. Chest computed tomography revealed that the catheter migrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space . Catheter removal with SVC repair via sternotomy or endovascular stent graft coverage with adequate pericardial drainage was advised, but the patient chose conservative treatment for the migrated device. Oral Vinorelbine 100 mg twice per month was initiated after a discussion with the primary care oncologist. This helped keep the patient in asymptomatic and tumor recurrence-free status during the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Migration of the catheter tip (arrowhead).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】The catheter migrated through the SVC into the pleural space (arrowhead).\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used for chemotherapy, transfusions and parenteral nutrition. The incidence of TIVAP malfunction ranges from 0.67 to 3.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–6 \\]</u>. Etiology includes intra-catheter thrombosis or precipitation, fibrin sheath formation or venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter kinking, pinch-off syndrome and catheter migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The incidence of spontaneous catheter migration ranges from 0.4 to 2% based on a review of the available literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In this case, the migrated catheter penetrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space, which is a rare clinical situation.\n\n【14】We postulate that the mechanism of catheter migration may be related to an elevated intra-thoracic cavity due to cough, which is especially frequent in patients with lung cancer, as described by Wu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Shallow catheter tip location, which is defined as a catheter tip located above the lower third of SVC, and lung cancer were assumed to be risk factors for catheter migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Here, the migrated catheter tip was directed towards the post-chemotherapy fibrotic SVC wall, with a combination of radial force caused by the angulating catheter itself, and the kinetic movement of the heartbeat resulting in penetration of the vessel wall into pleural space.\n\n【15】Chou _et al_ . reported a case of innominate vein penetration into the pleural space by a left-sided silicone TIVAP catheter 4 months after implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient had left-side massive pleural effusion after fluid infusion via TIVAP. In our patient, the catheter migrated into the right pleural space via the pericardial space, as shown by CT, which would explain his discomfort after chemotherapy. Over-the-wire catheter exchange or direct catheter removal are the treatment choice for the obstructed TIVAP. However, any intervention affecting the dysfunctional catheter, including removal or exchange may lead to possible lethal hemothorax or hemopericardium without proper closure of the chronic tract, which had been reported in previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Leaving the TIVAP without further utilization did not cause any adverse effect; therefore, this option was also provided. After understanding the treatment options, their risks and benefits, and considering his preferences, goals and beliefs, he did not want to undergo more invasive interventions, due to his old age and advanced cancer status. This decision was made according to the current shared decision making procedure.\n\n【16】In conclusion, extra-vascular migration of the catheter is a rare but important etiology of TIVAP malfunction. Physicians and surgeons should be aware of this risk when inserting a TIVAP as well as the way to prevent it, i.e. catheter tip check before usage or replacement.\n\n【17】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【18】The authors thank the primary care physician Dr Chin-Teng Yu for detailed case information sharing and the department chief Dr Sheng-Yueh Yu for general support.

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) suspected multiple bone metastasis including frontal bone, mandible, left scapula, rib, vertebra, pubis, left femur and sternum . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhanced mass in the sternum, which may be pricked with a needle biopsy easily . A needle biopsy of the sternum was performed.

Among these cases, only five cases were malignant or atypical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. A primary pulmonary meningioma is largely benign, grows slowly and has an excellent prognosis. Incarbone _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reviewed 37 cases of primary pulmonary meningiomas reported in the literature. Among 25 histologically confirmed primary pulmonary meningioma patients with radiological data of the CNS and histological assessment, 23 (92%) cases had benign and 2 (8%) cases had a malignant primary pulmonary meningioma.\n\n【23】Dalle Ore _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reviewed 1193 patients treated for meningioma including intracranial meningiomas. Ten patients had extracranial lesions suspicious for metastasis.

Biopsy-confirmed metastasis occurred in the liver 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, lung 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, mediastinum 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> and bone 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. The observed incidence of metastasis was 0.67% ( _n_ \\= 8). Incidence increased to 2% of WHO grade II and 8.6% of grade III meningiomas. Among these patients, no case of extracranial meningioma with bone metastasis has been reported.\n\n【24】We have reported rare case of malignant extracranial meningioma with multiple bone metastasis. By needle biopsy, we confirmed histopathological diagnosis as metastasis of primary pulmonary meningioma, WHO grade III. Moreover, pathology of the surgical specimen showed some vascular invasions in Fig. 4 , suggesting malignant behavior. In conclusion, our experience with the present case in primary pulmonary meningioma has shown that we should think about extracranial meningioma as differential diagnosis in case of the patient with bone metastasis. The patients with extracranial meningioma should therefore be carefully monitored.\n\n【25】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【26】We thank members of our division for helpful discussions.\n\n【27】Conflict of Interest statement\n------------------------------\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients and/or their families were informed that data from medical records would be submitted for publication and gave their consent.

In this report, we describe an unusual case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow tract obstruction in a patient with renal carcinoma. Bedside echocardiography allowed a rapid assessment of the hemodynamic effects of the mass.

We describe an unusual case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow tract obstruction in a patient with renal carcinoma.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 51-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department complaining chest discomfort and dyspnea. His cardiovascular history was unremarkable except for smoking and emphysema. Seven weeks earlier, because of persistent fever, cough and evidence of anemia, he had undergone chest–abdomen computed tomography (CT), with evidence of a solid mass (7 × 6.5 cm) in the left kidney. Brain CT scan, bone scintigraphy, colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy had shown no significant findings. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had been submitted to left radical nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. An echocardiogram performed at the time of the intervention had shown no significant abnormalities. The patient had been discharged 6 days after surgery, with the recommendation of continuing enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, lansoprazole, folic acid and antalgic treatment with oxycodone/naloxone and paracetamol/codeine.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was in poor general conditions, his pulse rate was 135 beats/min, and blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood examinations showed leucocytosis (23.29×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: 4.40–10.10×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), anemia (Hb 8.8 g/dL, normal range: 13.2–17.0 g/dL), thrombocytosis (734×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, normal range: <150–400×10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), and increased C-reactive protein (46.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia–hypocapnia. Ultrasound examination showed no evidence of venous thrombosis. Echocardiography showed a large mass (56 × 33 mm) attached to the anterior wall of the RV outflow tract, characterized by irregular shape, inhomogeneous echogenicity, and no evidence of vascularization . Doppler examination of RV outflow tract showed a peak subpulmonary gradient of 21 mmHg at rest. During forced expiration, the peak gradient increased up to 35 mmHg , suggesting dynamic RV outflow obstruction. There were also right atrial and ventricular enlargement with preserved systolic function (TAPSE 24 mm, tricuspid s’ 19 cm/s), severe tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension (52 mmHg), and reduced inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava. CT pulmonary angiography  confirmed the presence of a large mass obstructing the RV outflow tract, with irregular shape and no evidence of vascularization, suggesting RV thrombus. There were no emboli in the pulmonary vessels, but multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases were observed. No thrombosis was found in the systemic veins. Because of the recent history of surgery and the oncological prognosis, thrombolysis or surgery were not indicated. The patient was hospitalized and therapy with full-dose enoxaparin, fluids, antibiotics and steroids was started. Ten days after admission, an echocardiogram showed no significant changes, except for a mild improvement in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (moderate) and a slight reduction in mass dimensions (52 × 30 mm) and RV outflow tract gradient at rest (16 mmHg). The patient was discharged 1 week later on anticoagulation, but died 2 days thereafter.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Echocardiographic images showing the right ventricular mass  from the long-axis parasternal view ( **A** ), short-axis parasternal views ( **B** and **C** ), and parasternal right ventricular inflow view ( **D** ).

The detection of an isolated RV thrombus is a relatively rare event in patients with preserved RV systolic function, particularly when not associated with concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. Isolated RV thrombi have been reported in the setting of RV myocardial infarction and arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, Beçhet disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While neoplasms are associated with a thrombophilic state that increases the risk of cardiovascular events, isolated RV thrombi in cancer patients have been rarely described, in most cases resulting from extensive tumor-thrombus venous propagation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】This report describes a case of giant isolated RV thrombus presenting with acute RV failure secondary to RV outflow tract obstruction following left radical nephrectomy in a patient with renal carcinoma. Several atypical aspects should be pointed out in this case. First, the clinical presentation with acute heart failure secondary to dynamic RV outflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Second, the lack of thrombotic involvement of the systemic venous district, which in cancer patients commonly represents the pathway for thrombus propagation to the right ventricle. Third, the development of a large RV thrombus despite an apparently appropriate dose of enoxaparin, equal to that currently recommended by the 2014 ASCO guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Lastly, the evidence of a rapid thrombus formation despite preserved RV systolic function, which highlights the importance of thrombophilic states in the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On the other hand, although the echocardiographic and CT characteristics of the mass support its thrombotic nature, autopsy was not performed, so that no histological confirmation is available. Contrast echocardiography is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses, and could have provided additional information about the avascularity of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It is also worthy of note that, for patients with no evidence of a concomitant acute cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism), to date there are no specific guidelines for the management of intracardiac thrombi, and the relative efficacy of anticoagulation, thrombolysis or other approaches is still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Lastly, while the negativity of CT angiography makes the hypothesis of concomitant pulmonary embolism unlikely, this possibility cannot be completely excluded.\n\n【19】We believe that these issues could suggest clinical implications. The possibility of a RV outflow obstruction due to an isolated thrombus should be considered in patients with acute RV failure, even when there is no concomitant thrombosis in the systemic venous district. This may be particularly important in patients with neoplasms or other conditions associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Bedside echocardiography plays a fundamental role for prompt assessment in this context. Lastly, the effectiveness of standard prophylactic doses of enoxaparin might be reduced in patients with prothrombotic states.\n\n【20】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【21】Supplementary material is available at Oxford Medical Case Reports online.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【23】None.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】There were no sources of funding for this article.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】Not needed for this type of article.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Written informed consent to publish this case was obtained.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】All authors are the guarantors of this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This is a rare case of COVID-19 with hyperlipoproteinemia, and the causes of hyperlipoproteinemia might be associated with COVID-19 complications, steroids and/or lifestyle changes during the pandemic; therefore, changes in TGs should be observed carefully after the resolution of COVID-19.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic, including pneumonia with multiorgan disease and various complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Many complications due to COVID-19 have been reported, even after discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, hyperlipoproteinemia combined with COVID-19 has not yet been reported; moreover, steroid therapy for COVID-19 can induce hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of severe hypertriglyceridemia >5000 mg/dl triglyceride (TG) appearing after COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We herein report a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonia combined with severe hypertriglyceridemia based on a TG level >8000 mg/dl, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 55-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for fever, cough, headache and taste disorder 6 days prior. She had a medical history of hypertriglyceridemia. She had increased her alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic since 2019, and treatment with 0.2 mg of pemafibrate was started because her TG levels had increased to ~700 mg/dl at 1 month before admission. However, lipid-lowering therapy was stopped by a local doctor due to the appearance of symptoms. There was no remarkable family history. Her vital signs on admission revealed a high-grade fever of 38.6°C and hypoxemia requiring oxygen at 2 l/min via nasal cannula. Physical examination did not show abnormal findings. The laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count of 3390 cells/μl; C-reactive protein level of 9.23 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 78 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 50 IU/l and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 5.9%. A positive result was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction using posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multifocal bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Chest CT scans showed multifocal bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities.\n\n【9】Accordingly, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with 60 mg of methylprednisolone, remdesivir and heparin. Her symptoms and radiographic findings improved gradually; however, the improvement was slow, and her radiological abnormalities remained on Day 10 of hospitalization. Therefore, steroids were not stopped on Day 10 of hospitalization, and the dose of steroids was decreased. Taste disorder remained after discharge, and she consumed excessive alcohol and a larger amount of food. At 32 days after the appearance of her initial symptoms, the blood sample appeared lipemic on 5 mg of prednisolone, and laboratory findings showed the following: TG level of 8750 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 192 mg/dl, AST level of 106 IU/l, ALT level of 134 IU/l, amylase level of 50 U/l, lipase level of 36 IU/l and HbA1c level of 6.3%. Her thyroid function was normal, and antinuclear antibody was negative. Electrophoresis of the lipoproteins showed that the proportion of alpha was 9.3% (normal range: 20.4–46.4%), that of preβ was 41.8% (normal range: 3.8–33.8%), that of β was 25.6% (normal range: 36.5–59.1%) and that of the origin was 23.3%, which showed the presence of chylomicrons and an increase in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. The apolipoprotein fraction indicated concentrations of apolipoprotein B of 186 mg/dl, C-II of 47.5 mg/dl, C-III of 55.1 mg/dl and E of 32.2 mg/dl, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) levels decreased to 50 mg/dl. The phenotype of apolipoprotein E was E3/2. The patient was thus diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. She did not have any symptoms of pancreatitis, and her TG levels were decreased by restriction of fat intake and sobriety.\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【11】We herein report a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonia with severe hypertriglyceridemia, suspected to be Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. Generally, Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, which is a rare form of severe hypertriglyceridemia characterized by increasing VLDL and chylomicronemia, is caused by a genetic disorder or environmental factors such as heavy drinking and autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Regardless, she did not have a remarkable familial history, and the cause of Type V hyperlipoproteinemia was unknown. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for the development of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>; therefore, changes in TGs should be observed carefully in patients after resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【12】One of the reasons for hyperlipoproteinemia progression might be the interruption of lipid-lowering therapy. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia in patients with COVID-19 is 26%, and lipid parameters, including TG levels, often decrease in the presence of cytokine-mediated inflammation as a consequence of the acute phase response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is suggested that lipid-lowering therapy should not be stopped for patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, considering the slow progression of hyperlipoproteinemia until admission, it was thought that steroid therapy, complications of COVID-19 and/or lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with hyperlipoproteinemia progression in this case.\n\n【13】TG levels are influenced by several medications, such as steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, which are used for COVID-19 treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A previous study demonstrated that TG levels were increased in the long term to 156 ± 54 mg/dl by prednisolone treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Some patients have TG levels > 1000 mg/dl, which is caused by corticosteroids, although none have TG levels > 2200 mg/dl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is suggested that steroid therapy alone cannot increase TG levels to >8000 mg/dl. Furthermore, for patients with COVID-19, corticosteroids reduce 28-day mortality and are usually applied in the short term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient stopped steroid therapy on Day 39 through a decrease in dose. Accordingly, the cause of the increased TG level in our patient might be not only a side effect of corticosteroids but also other environmental factors.\n\n【14】Her alcohol consumption and amount of food intake increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 4-fold declaration of a state of emergency in Tokyo, Japan, starting in April 2020. In general, people worldwide have had to stay at home and practice social distancing during the pandemic, and lifestyle changes are related to body weight gain and alcohol consumption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Alcohol with plasma TG metabolism leads to hypercholesterolemia in a complex interplay with partially altered LPL activity, often with a genetically predisposed background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Moreover, she consumed alcohol excessively and a larger amount of food because of taste disorder as a COVID-19 complication after discharge. Accordingly, it is important to understand the changes in the patient’s lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after the resolution of COVID-19.\n\n【15】This is a rare case of COVID-19 with Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. COVID-19 can induce many complications in accordance with therapy and social changes during the pandemic. Therefore, changes in TGs should be observed carefully in patients after the resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【16】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【17】None.\n\n【18】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【19】None declared.\n\n【20】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【21】This work was not supported by any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【22】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【23】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【24】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【25】We obtained informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case.\n\n【26】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【27】Masafumi Shimoda and Yoshiaki Tanaka.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The underlying mechanism of such pneumothoraxes is considered to be the result of the rupture of subpleural cystic spaces (bulla and bleb) related to diffuse interstitial fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】A 72-year-old man with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) was hospitalized with his first presentation of severe closed pneumothorax. He had suffered from severe pulmonary hypertension (PH, mean pulmonary artery pressure 72.6 mmHg). We inserted a chest tube (a thoracic catheter, double-lumen, 20Fr) from the left fourth intercostal on the midclavicular line. We monitored the pleural drainage for 1 week; however, the air leak continued. We were unable to perform surgery on this patient because of his severe PH. His CPFE was also contraindications for other stimulant pleurodeses such as OK-432 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, we tried to stop the air leak with autologous blood patch pleurodesis (ABPP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which is an alternative to surgery when conservative management is ineffective for treating a persistent air leak. This is obtained by instillating 100 ml of autologous blood through the chest tube, followed by clamping 1 hour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We repeated the chest X-ray every day to assess the state of pneumothorax.\n\n【3】After ABPP was performed three times in total with an interval of several days, the air leak stopped and we removed the chest tube. However, 7 days after removing the tube, his pneumothorax recurred. Chest computed tomography indicated that the large bullae in his lower lung lobe were ruptured. We placed a chest tube from his eighth intercostal on the midaxillary line, aiming for more precise chest tube placement over the large bullae . We tried ABPP once again and finally succeeded in stopping the air leak . His pneumothorax had not recurred from >4 weeks after chest tube removal.\n\n【4】Figure 1\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Chest computed tomography images: ( **a** ) after placing the second chest tube, the chest tube was placed more precisely over the air leak site; ( **b** ) after another attempt at ABPP, air leak had stopped and the left lung was fully inflated.

In this study, we presented a case showing signs of an acute abdomen with sharp rises in serum pancreatic biochemical markers during the treatment of DKA with pyelonephritis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed to confirm the onset of acute pancreatitis; however, pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement of the rectal wall were detected, indicating the presence of rectal infarction. Hartmann’s procedure was immediately performed, and histological examination of the resected specimen revealed gangrenous ischaemic colitis. The present case highlights DKA as a risk factor of ischaemic colitis and the role of contrast-enhanced CT in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Ischaemic colitis occurs when there is a transient or sustained compromise in blood flow that fails to meet the metabolic needs of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This leads to mucosal ulceration, inflammation, haemorrhage and eventually bowel infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Different types of ischaemic colitis, including transient colitis, chronic ulcerative colitis with or without stricture, and gangrenous colitis, are differentiated based on their clinical course and severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Gangrenous colitis has a high mortality rate of up to 40% and requires urgent surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) plays a critical role in the development of ischaemic colitis due to mesenteric collapse as it results in a serious reduction of fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We herein describe a patient with gangrenous ischaemic colitis who presented with an acute abdomen during an episode of DKA that was difficult to differentially diagnose from acute pancreatitis, which is also a common comorbidity of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man who had been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidaemia and spinocerebellar degeneration with orthostatic dysregulation, dysarthria, neurogenic bladder and faecal incontinence at a local clinic was referred to our department for inadequate glycaemic control with impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale E2V1M4). On admission to the emergency room, he had a body temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure of 84/56 mm Hg, pulse of 104 bpm and respiration rate of 24 breaths/min. Physical examination showed clear lungs and no cardiac murmurs on chest auscultation, non-palpable liver and spleen, decreased bowel sounds, no abdominal distension, mass or bruit, and no oedema in the extremities. Laboratory examination showed high levels of fasting plasma glucose (1500 mg/dl) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 10.6%). DKA was diagnosed based on the detection of metabolic acidaemia (pH 7.209) with an increased anion gap (27.7 mEq/L) due to high serum ketone levels (4.04 mmol/L). Urinalysis revealed that the urine was macroscopically cloudy, and urinary occult blood, ketone, and sugar were strongly positive. Leukocytosis (27.1 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with predominant neutrophils (92.0%), high serum C-reactive protein levels (4.54 mg/dl), and pyuria with leukocytes ≥10/high power field in the urinary sediment were suggestive of concomitant pyelonephritis. Biochemistry analysis indicated a marked increase in serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (139.2 mg/dL), creatinine (5.10 mg/dL), potassium (7.7 mEq/L), creatinine kinase (CK 3480 IU/L) with predominant CK-MM isozyme (BB 0%, MB 2%, MM 98%), and myoglobin levels (10 899 IU/L) representing renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities and rhabdomyolysis. The electrocardiogram reflected the patient’s hyperkalaemic status with a marked high-peaked T wave in leads V <sub>2–4 </sub> and wide QRS complexes in all leads. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) analysis on arrival revealed no significant findings in the head, chest, abdomen or intrapelvis .\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Computed tomography of the intrapelvis showed no apparent abnormalities on admission (A and B), but revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poor enhancement in the rectal wall on Day 2 of hospitalization (C and D, _arrow_ ).\n\n【9】Treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of isotonic saline (0.9% saline solution) and regular insulin was initiated after the diagnosis of DKA, but haemodialysis was not performed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was also intravenously administered after blood and urine cultures were obtained. Streptococcus species were detected with a bacterial count of ≥10 <sup>5 </sup> colony-forming units/ml in the urine culture test. Streptococcus, a weak pathogen, accounts for only 1–2% of causative bacteria of urinary tract infections. However, the patient had poorly controlled DM and neurogenic bladder, which could have contributed to the development of streptococcal-related pyelonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The results of multiple blood cultures were negative for bacteraemia. For DKA, plasma glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in capillary blood were corrected to 378 mg/dl and 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, 18 hours after the initiation of treatment. Serum potassium levels were dropped to 5.7 mEq/L, which almost normalized the electrocardiogram findings at that time. However, the treatment failed to ameliorate renal failure as serum BUN and creatinine remained high, i.e. 128.3 mg/dl and 5.22 mg/dl, respectively. Impaired consciousness and haemodynamic instability continued, and diffuse distension and rigidity of the abdomen were newly observed. Intestinal peristalsis remained diminished, and no melena was observed. Serum pancreatic biochemical markers that were normal at the time of admission (amylase 98 IU/L) rose remarkably (amylase 1026 IU/L, pancreatic type amylase 1013 IU/L, and lipase 1201 IU/L). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed to elucidate coexisting acute pancreatitis, which revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and poorly enhanced bowel walls of the rectum , but no evidence of severe pancreatitis was found. There were no mesenteric artery and venous occlusion due to emboli and thrombosis.\n\n【10】The patient underwent Hartmann’s procedure, including segmental resection of the rectum and sigmoid colostomy formation. The resected rectum was clearly demarcated from the non-necrotic area and the necrotic mucosa was a circumferential lesion . Histological examination of the specimen revealed typical findings of gangrenous ischaemic colitis, such as coagulative mucosal necrosis, submucosal haemorrhage and necrotising muscle layer infiltrated with numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils . The patient recovered uneventfully after surgery and subsequent rehabilitation practices, and he has then maintained proper glycaemic control (HbA <sub>1c </sub> 5.9–6.3%) with oral glucose-lowering agents and normal renal function for 2 years after being discharged.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】(A) Gross appearance of the resected specimen revealed an entire circumferential necrotic lesion of the rectal mucosa. The lesion had a relatively clear border and several linear and map-like mucosal ulcerations in the non-necrotic region. Histopathological examination of the resected rectum revealed (B) a lesion with clear demarcation from the area of unaltered crypt architecture, and (C) sloughing of the epithelium with loss of ductal epithelial cells (ghost-like appearance) . The examination also revealed (D) mucosal coagulative necrosis and submucosal haemorrhage, and (E) necrotising muscle layer infiltrated with numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils . Haematoxylin and eosin staining: original magnification: (B) ×40, (C)×100, (D)×20 and (E)×400.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Six risk factors including hypoalbuminaemia (<3.5 g/dl), older age (≥60 years), haemodialysis, hypertension, DM and use of constipation-inducing medication are associated with the development of ischaemic colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Of these, the patient had four risk factors: older age (61 years), hypoalbuminaemia (2.9 g/dl) and a history of hypertension and T2DM. His abnormal bowel habits including recurrent constipation and diarrhoea due to spinocerebellar degeneration might have increased the visceral intraluminal pressure, leading to worsened bowel wall ischaemia.\n\n【16】The CK isozyme CK-BB is found in the mucosa and muscularis throughout the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. After intestinal infarction, serum CK-BB levels immediately rise, peak at 6 hours, and rapidly drop within 24 hours, even in the presence of progressive irreversible bowel infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case, serum CK-BB isozyme was not detected at the time of admission; therefore, bowel infarction was likely to be initiated after hospitalization. Clinically, ischaemic colitis frequently occurs in the descending and sigmoid colon rather than in the rectum as the three arteries (right and left iliac arteries, and the superior rectal artery) supply blood to the rectum. This characteristic rectal circulation might have contributed to the slow progression of ischaemic colitis before the intestine became gangrenous during his hyperglycaemic crisis.\n\n【17】Acute pancreatitis occurs in 11% of adults with DKA, whereas non-specific elevations in serum amylase and lipase levels are observed in 40% of DKA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. High serum amylase levels are also associated with bowel infarction, and the magnitude of hyperamylasaemia is related to the degree of infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, bowel infarction and acute pancreatitis may show similar clinical picture, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the two based solely on pancreatic biochemical marker values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This case supports the finding that contrast-enhanced CT imaging should be considered in DKA patients to exclude acute pancreatitis when serum amylase levels rise more than three times the normal upper limits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In conclusion, clinical course and laboratory findings in DKA patients may be non-specific to distinguish severe ischaemic colitis from other intra-abdominal diseases, including acute pancreatitis. Evaluation of contrast-enhanced CT imaging may provide useful information for prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of intestinal ischaemia in order to achieve a favourable outcome.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【20】The authors thank Dr Yuichi Kataoka (Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan) for his collaboration.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【22】None declared.\n\n【23】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【24】The present case report meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the local legal requirements.\n\n【25】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.\n\n【27】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【28】Hiroaki Iwasaki.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This causes venous stasis and increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Typically, patients with absent IVCs present before 30 years of age, with bilateral DVT symptoms triggered by intense exercise. The abnormality can remain undetected as computed tomography imaging is not usually performed. Due to the increased risk of clotting, these patients should be on life-long anticoagulation. Raising clinical awareness of this condition, to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment, is important.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Abnormally developed inferior vena cavae (IVCs) affect ~4% of the population, including variants such as agenesis, hypoplasia, duplication and interruption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Such anomalies can be isolated or accompanied by other congenital abnormalities, e.g. polysplenia, asplenia and dextrocardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The agenesis or absence of an IVC is rare, prevalence estimated 0.0005–1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Causes include embryological malformation and perinatal IVC thrombosis causing blockage and subsequent regression of the IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】An absent IVC necessitates collateral vessel formation to drain the abdominal organs and peripheries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These inefficient vessels increase the patient’s risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) venous stasis and ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8–12 \\]</u>. Identification of these patients is important to help reduce their risk of adverse thrombotic events.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 24-year-old man presented to hospital with leg and hip pain, commencing during high-intensity interval training, an activity he regularly undertook. The pain originated in his right leg, spreading to the left and both hips. Additionally, he reported 1 day history of dyspnoea worse on exertion and associated dizziness. He denied symptoms of cough, fever, haemoptysis or pleuritic chest pain. He reported intentional weight loss of 3.5 stone over 1 year.\n\n【8】His past medical history comprised of asthma. He took no regular medications and didn’t smoke. There was no reported family history. He works as a financial manager.\n\n【9】Clinical observations were heart rate 103, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 126/69 and oxygen saturations 100% on room air. Heart sounds were normal and chest was clear. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. His right calf was swollen compared with the left and tender on palpation. Coordination, power and sensation of both legs were intact.\n\n【10】An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm and no cardiovascular strain . A chest X-ray demonstrated an azygous fissure. Ultrasound of the right leg demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the great saphenous vein, from the right sapheno-femoral junction to the popliteal vein. Ultrasound of the left leg revealed a thrombus extending from the left common femoral vein into the popliteal vein. A handheld echocardiogram exhibited no right heart strain, and lab-measured troponin was 2.\n\n【11】Figure 1\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Patient’s admission ECG.\n\n【14】A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram and thorax–abdomen–pelvis showed extensive bilateral PEs . There was no saddle embolus or radiological evidence of right heart strain. Prominent femoral and internal iliac veins were seen . Clots were seen in both iliac veins and distal IVC. There was no IVC visible above the level of the renal veins . The proximal IVC was patent, with venous collateralization in the retroperitoneum, suggesting a chronic diagnosis. Abdominal venous drainage was predominantly via the azygos and hemi-azygos system.\n\n【15】Figure 2\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】CTPA revealing pulmonary embolus within the right lung, labelled as filling defect.\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】CTPA revealing pulmonary embolus within the left lung, labelled as filling defect.\n\n【21】Figure 4\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】Sagittal CT image demonstrating the presence of the IVC.\n\n【24】Figure 5\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】Sagittal CT image demonstrating an absent IVC.\n\n【27】A thrombosis screen including; paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, thrombophila screen, anti-nuclear antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies, beta-2-glycoprotein level, anticardiolipin levels, Hep B&C, human immunodeficiency virus screen and JAK-2 mutation screening was negative.\n\n【28】The gentleman was initially administered treatment-dose tinzaparin pending vascular MDT. Mechanical thrombectomy was considered but deemed not in his best interest due to the high risk of venous re-occlusion in the presence of persisting venous outflow obstruction. Lifelong anticoagulation was recommended. Given his haemodynamic stability throughout admission thrombolysis was deemed unnecessary. Anticoagulation with rivaroxaban caused rectal bleeding and he was switched to apixaban, which has been well tolerated. He remains asymptomatic at 1-year post-diagnosis, under follow-up from the haematology team.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【30】The IVC is made up of four parts, the hepatic, supra-renal, renal and infra-renal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The phrase ‘absent IVC’ refers to an absence of all sections, or an absence of one or combinations of sections, with the mechanism best understood by looking at the embryological formation of the venous system. In utero, the vessels below the liver are formed by three pairs of veins, the subcardinal, posterior cardinal and supracardinal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. An absence of the entire IVC requires the incorrect formation of all three pairs. As the probability of this occurring as a systematic embryological error is unlikely, it is possible that an absent IVC without other congenital abnormalities may not be truly congenital, but rather pathological 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】An absent IVC could be due to perinatal thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. One case describes a girl presenting with symptoms, and a consequent diagnosis of DVT within 48 hours of her birth, and no discernable IVC on ultrasound at that time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. When rescanned aged 12, a thrombosed IVC with partial refilling was seen, suggesting a hypoplastic IVC. Another potential cause of absent IVCs is renal thrombosis, a phenomenon encountered in unwell infants and has been shown to accompany IVC thrombosis and regression of the infra-renal IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 17 \\]</u>. The terminology ‘absent IVC’ could therefore be a misnomer, with ‘hypoplasia’ being potentially more appropriate.\n\n【32】While hypoplasia of an infra-renal IVC is a rare but well-documented anomaly, the CT in this case demonstrates a normal infra-renal IVC with a hypoplastic suprarenal IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. This is a highly unusual presentation, with only one prior documented case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】To our knowledge, there are three reported cases of PE with associated IVC abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10–12 \\]</u>. The mechanism for DVT is peripheral venous stasis, rather than blood hypercoagulability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. PEs are secondary to clot formation within the collateral veins that travel through the heart to the lungs.\n\n【34】There were 62 documented cases of abnormal IVC presenting with DVT as of 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Approximately 5% of patients presenting with unprovoked DVT under the age of 30 were found to have IVC abnormalities, indicating that it is a significant risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Intense exercise is a trigger for DVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In our patient, we postulate that the congenital IVC abnormality was the major risk factor, but that the intense exercise could have contributed to the extent of the clot.\n\n【35】Current NICE guidelines do not require a CT for patients with DVT unless there is concern of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Without a CT, patients with absent IVCs as the cause of their DVT may go undetected. Due to the increased thrombotic risk, patients under the age of 30 with symptoms of bilateral DVT provoked by exercise must therefore be considered for imaging to investigate abnormal IVC development.\n\n【36】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【37】Dr Jonathan Barber and Dr Philip Marjoram.\n\n【38】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【39】No funding was required for this case report.\n\n【40】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【41】None declared.\n\n【42】ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT\n----------------------------\n\n【43】Consent was obtained from the patient in regards to writing the case study, and data was anonymized.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Her clinical course became complicated by a blood-gas demonstrating a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient was diagnosed with pyroglutamic metabolic acidosis. This is a rare interaction between high dose flucloxacillin and paracetamol, and is an important complication to recognize.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Pyroglutamic acidosis (PGA) is a rare complication of co-prescribed penicillin (isoxazolyl) and paracetamol. The risk of PGA is increased by polypharmacy as well as multiple co-morbidities. If not recognized and addressed, PGA can contribute significantly towards poorer patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 71-year-old lady with a background history of hypertension was transferred for step-down care on intravenous antibiotics. She was diagnosed with L5 discitis and suspected infective endocarditis complicating a _Staphylococcus aureus_ blood stream infection (BSI). Transoesophageal echo had shown a mobile echo density on the aortic valve and the diagnosis of discitis was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was no clear source of the bacteraemia. The patient reported a significant history of chills and fevers for 1 week post coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. There was no evidence of collection at the site of vaccination. The _S.aureus_ blood culture isolate was susceptible to flucloxacillin. She was commenced on 2 g of flucloxacillin 4 hourly along with 1 g of IV paracetamol four times daily for analgesia. This regimen continued for 2 weeks with an appropriate response clinically and biochemically. The only side-effect of treatment noted was persistent nausea, developing around Day 10.\n\n【6】The patient’s condition began to deteriorate on Day 16, with increasing nausea and several episodes of vomiting. She became hypotensive, dyspnoeic and developed a reduction in her urine output. The biochemistry results demonstrated a new acute kidney injury (AKI) with creatinine rising from 78 to 160 μmol/L. Blood gas showed a pH of 7.29, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 2.3 kPa and a bicarbonate of 15 mmol/L. Lactate was normal. These results were consistent with a high anion gap acidosis (HAGMA) of 26 mEq/L. Alternative causes of acute deterioration with these symptoms and biochemistry, such as sepsis, were considered and excluded. PGA was suspected due to the treatment regimen alongside the biochemical indices. The nausea and vomiting were a response to low pH and the dyspnoea was an attempt to eliminate CO <sub>2 </sub> as compensation for the acidosis.\n\n【7】Diagnosis of PGA was confirmed with urine showing the presence of inorganic acids. Paracetamol was stopped and flucloxacillin was changed to a cephalosporin (Cefurxime). The patient’s symptoms resolved and blood gas parameters normalized after 48 hours. However, she developed significant adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression and an allergic reaction to second- and third-line antimicrobial agents. These also had inadequate or suboptimal anti-staphylococcal cover and her inflammatory markers began to rise. Noscomial infection was ruled out at this stage with appropriate screening tests. A repeat MRI at 6 weeks demonstrated ongoing active infection at the L5 region. A reintroduction of flucloxacillin without paracetamol was successful and the patient completed another 6 week course with no further complications. Repeat MRI showed significant improvements in discitis.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】The risk of PGA secondary to the interaction between flucloxacillin and paracetamol is poorly recognized in clinical practice and literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The causes of a HAGMA can be summarized by the acronym GOLD-MARK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> (glycols, oxoproline, lactate, D-lactate, methanol, aspirin, renal failure and ketoacidosis).\n\n【10】Pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) is an intermediate metabolite of the gamma-glutamyl cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Both paracetamol and flucloxacillin interact with the gamma-glutamyl cycle as outlined below and in Figure 1 :\n\n【11】*   1) Paracetamol contributes to cysteine deficiency through direct conjugation. The paracetamol metabolite, N-acetyl-P-benzoquinonimine binds irreversibly to glutathione. When glutathione levels are depleted, the feedback inhibition is removed resulting in the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine and the formation of 5-oxoproline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】*   2) Flucloxacillin inhibits 5-oxoprolinase, preventing degradation of pyroglutamic acid to glutamate. This leads to higher concentrations of 5-oxoproline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Figure 1\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Glutamyl cycle ( **a** ) and effect of paracetamol and flucloxacillin on the y-glutamyl cycle ( **b** ). In the γ-glutamyl cycle, the rate-limiting step is the conversion of glutamic acid to γ-glutamyl-cysteine by γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase.\n\n【16】Pyroglutamic acid is renally excreted. This patient had an AKI, which exacerbated the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the kidneys and further impacted renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Anecdotally, we have seen an increase in the number of patients presenting with discitis following a prolonged period of fevers and chills following COVID-19 vaccination. Nationally, the rate of community acquired _S. aureus_ BSI has increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We could postulate that this is related to an indirect effect on the immune system from infection with COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccination, or that prolonged rigors related to vaccination could lead to bacterial translocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In summary, an increased awareness of the possible interaction between these two commonly co-prescribed medications is essential in recognizing PGA. This, along with clinical signs and biochemical indices, could alert clinicians to PGA as a cause of the acutely deteriorating patient on this commonly prescribed regimen. Finally, this paper also outlines how there should be more awareness among clinicians for this phenomenon.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【20】The authors have no interests to declare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In conclusion, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be reconsidered as benign disease with short- and long-term outcome and complications.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has gained global recognition after its first description in Japan where derived its name from the Japanese word takotsubo (octopus pot) to describe the characteristic ballooning of the left ventricular (LV) apex. The disease is characterized by transient LV dysfunction with a variety of wall-motion abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It accounts for 2% of ST-segment elevation infarcts, with most cases described in postmenopausal women. The most common clinical presentations are chest pain and dyspnoea (67.8 and 17.8%, respectively). The onset of symptoms was often preceded by emotional or physical stress (26.8% and 37.8%, respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, after nearly 30 years of extensive efforts for better understanding of this disorder, current knowledge remains limited.

Furthermore, the role of catecholamine excess in its pathogenesis has been long debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally recognized as a benign disorder.

Patient denied any recent physical or emotional stresses. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm with known left bundle branch block (LBBB). Laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes were within normal ranges. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic function (EF 56%), diastolic dysfunction grade-I, and paradoxical septal motion with aneurysmal anterior septal walls . Following guideline of suspected ischemic heart disease diagnostic algorithm, it was recommended to perform pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) which reveled no perfusion defects suggestive of ischemia were detected . Early invasive strategy was not recommended in such patient according to guidelines. So, guideline-directed medical therapy was initiated. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed that reveled outpouching of anterior septal wall with no myocardial edema, no inflammatory changes, no intramural tumors and no myocardial fatty infiltration; delayed gadolinium enhancement showed no macroscopic scars or thrombus . Two years ago, she had emotional marital stress then she complained about severe crushing chest pain and was admitted into another hospital. Her ECG did not show any significant ischemic changes despite already present LBBB. Her cardiac enzymes were normal. She performed stress-ECG for 6 min that was terminated by severe dyspnea but no chest pain with ST-segment depression in inferior leads. Coronary angiography was done and demonstrated normal coronary arteries  but was complicated by right femoral hematoma. Predischarge TTE showed near-normal LV systolic function (EF 51%), diastolic dysfunction grade-I, and paradoxical septal motion with apical hypokinesia and ballooning (diagnosed as Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy). Patient was discharged on Ramipril 5 mg, Bisoprolol 10 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg and Aspirin 81 mg.

Patient was discharged on Bisoprolol 10 mg, Olmesartan 20 mg, Amlodipine 5 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg. Patient was improved with no dyspnea or chest pain at follow-up visits.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has a clinical presentation similar to an acute coronary syndrome. Actually, most patients experienced with chest pain or dyspnea. Usually, the ECG at presentation shows ST-segment elevation but T wave inversion and pathological Q waves are present in majority of patients. Therefore, initial diagnosis and treatment of patients in the emergency room remains challenging. Unfortunately, there are no clinical, radiological or laboratory characteristics that certainly diagnose this syndrome. However, postmenopausal women with a history of recent emotional or physical stress, and with the typical profound wall-motion abnormalities; despite normal coronary arteries on angiography should raise suspicion for it. Furthermore, proposed Mayo’s diagnostic criteria for the syndrome had evolved and should be used.\n\n【21】Multimodality imaging plays a pivotal role in managing the case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Several variants have been described based on the regions of LV wall-motion abnormality. Typically, Takotsubo is characterized by ballooning apical akinesis/hypokinesis associated with basal hyperkinesis. Although, reversed variant of Takotsubo is rare and characterized by the basal akinesis/hypokinesis associated with apical hyperkinesis. However, other patterns of LV wall-motion abnormality have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Cardiac MRI is appropriate to evaluate LV function and wall-motion abnormalities, and to confirm the absence of delayed gadolinium enhancement. This helps differentiation of Takotsubo from other differential diagnosis as myocardial infarction and myocarditis, both pathologies associated with delayed gadolinium enhancement. There is limited consensus in long-term management, although it is reasonable to treat patients with β-blockers and ACE inhibitors during the ventricular recovery period. However, no data support their continuous use for the prevention of recurrence or improvement of survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Fortunately, the prognosis is favorable for patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy who survived the initial episode using symptomatic and supportive measures. LV systolic function usually returns to normal range within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, recent studies have found that Takotsubo patients had a similar long-term outcome compared with age- and sex-matched acute coronary syndrome patients. Additionally, these outcomes also vary according to the preceding trigger, and patients with events triggered by emotional stress had a favorable short- and long-term prognosis. Thus, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a much more complex syndrome than previously thought, and should be classified according to the underlying trigger event to accurately risk stratify and predict short- and long-term outcomes for each patient individually. Furthermore, the new classification (InterTAK Classification) could be useful in predicting Takotsubo outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】There are published rare cases with serious complication of LV dysfunction after Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These serious complications ranged from cardiogenic shock, persistent LV aneurysm that even required resection and LV plasty, ventricular septal perforation with septal dissection, and cardiac rupture that may lead to death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, careful observation with appropriate treatment of complication is needed for prevention of catastrophic serious outcomes.\n\n【24】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【25】Special thanks to Dr Ahmed Loutfy, BSN MSN PhD for his contributes and valuable comments to this case report.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】No funding was received for this report.\n\n【28】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【29】None declared.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】The case study was approved by local hospital ethical committee and with Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Full verbal and written informed consent had been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.\n\n【34】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【35】Dr Ali Elzieny is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The head and neck region accounts for most adult RMSs. Here, we report a case of a 24-year-old Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with persistent hoarseness and a painless left-sided neck mass. Physical examination and image studies showed a massive tumor of the nasopharynx, extending from the left-sided skull base to supraglottic structures. Histopathologic evaluation revealed the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated RMS. Due to the primary tumor size and involvement of crucial structures, extensive surgical excision was not amenable. Thus, the patient was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although very rare, nasopharyngeal RMSs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adult patients. This case report illustrates the difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of rare head and neck malignancies and encourages its reporting.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was first mentioned by Weber in Virchow’s Archives in 1854 and describes a malignant soft tissue neoplasm of skeletal muscle origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. RMS constitutes more than 50% of all soft tissue sarcomas in children but is exceedingly rare in adults. Less than 1% of all adult malignancies are soft tissue sarcomas, of which RMS accounts for only 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most common histologic variants encountered in children and adolescents are embryonal and alveolar subtypes, whereas the pleomorphic subtype and RMS not otherwise specified are more frequently seen in adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. RMS can arise in a variety of anatomic sites throughout the body but the most common primary tumor sites include the head and neck region, followed by the genitourinary and extremity primaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Routinely, patients are diagnosed with an asymptomatic mass or show symptoms that are associated with mass effects of the primary tumor site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is made by image studies including computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as tissue biopsies of the suspected mass. Treatment of RMS is multimodal and includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, RMS of the head and neck region are rarely amenable to extensive surgical excision due to proximity of vital structures. The outcome of adults with RMS appears to be worse than that of children with a 5-year overall survival rate of 27% versus 61%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To date, only a handful of cases of nasopharyngeal RMS in adult patients have been reported in the English literature. We report a case of an aggressive pulmonary metastasized RMS of the nasopharynx in an adult patient who was initially misdiagnosed and treated conservatively.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 24-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our outpatient department for persistent hoarseness and a painless left-sided neck mass. Both symptoms had developed 6 weeks ago and progressively worsened. Additionally, cervical radiculopathy occurred and was treated with non-beneficial physical therapy. Apart from being a premature born twin, status post-appendectomy and status post-tonsillectomy, the patient’s past medical and family histories were unremarkable. In physical examination, a painless, hard and non-mobile left-sided neck mass could be found in level II. With ultrasound of the neck a non-specific hypoechoic mass could be correlated . Endoscopic examination showed the left-sided palatal arch and pharyngeal wall to be protracted and unilateral paralysis of the left vocal cord. The patient’s tongue pointed leftwards and showed muscle fasciculation. Laboratory testing showed normal blood count and non-elevated inflammation parameters. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the head and neck was performed and revealed a 6.1 cm × 3.1 cm × 7.0 cm well-circumscribed, homogeneous, contrast-enhanced tumor extending from the left-sided skull base to supraglottic structures . Also, two suspicious lymph nodes were found in the left-sided neck in level II. Additionally, a contrast-enhanced CT angiography showed the lateralization of the carotid artery and indentation of the internal jugular vein but ruled out infiltrative tumor growth and bone erosion . Naso- and oropharyngeal tissue biopsies of the tumor plus ultrasound-guided tissue biopsies of the suspicious lymph nodes were performed. Histopathological evaluation was performed in our pathology department plus a referral center and revealed the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated RMS, whereas patterns of alveolar RMS or Myo-D1 mutant could not be identified. The case was discussed in an interdisciplinary tumor board. In conclusion, the tumor was defined as a poorly differentiated RMS of the nasopharynx with bilateral pulmonary metastases (T4N1M1). Rapidly emerging symptoms as recurrent syncope and increasing paralysis of affected cranial nerves IX, X and XII favored emergency irradiation of the parapharnygeal space and skull base, which was initiated 1 month after the first consultation of the patient. The patient received a total dose of 54 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions (1.8 Gy/fraction), followed by three courses of chemotherapy according to CWS guidance. At the time this case report was prepared, the patient received the last course of chemotherapy.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Ultrasound of the left-sided neck showed a non-specific hypoechoic mass.

Parameningeal RMS include RMS of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, nose, middle ear, mastoid, infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa, whereas nonparameningeal RMS include RMS of the orbit, parotid gland, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The head and neck region accounts for most RMS, with the orbit being the most frequent primary tumor site, followed by the oral cavity. In contrast, RMS rarely presents originating from the nasopharyngeal space as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, when the patient was admitted at our institution, she had asymmetric endoscopic findings and experienced hoarseness as well as a painless left-sided neck mass. A variety of clinical symptoms can occur with soft tissue carcinomas mostly lacking a cardinal sign. Therefore, most patients have an advanced disease at the stage of initial presentation. RMS exhibit fast and aggressive tumor growth, reaching large dimensions, and are typically painless but associated with generalised metastases and high rates of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The most common site of metastasis is the lung, followed by metastases to the bone marrow. Other common metastases are found in bone or distant nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. RMS often is difficult to diagnose because of its resemblance with other malignancies of the head and neck region. To date, no clear risk factors for RMS have been identified. Compared with other soft tissue carcinomas, prognosis of RMS is relatively poor but depends on clinical staging and the anatomical site of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. When such lesion is suspected, tissue biopsy analysis is the key to diagnosis, and should be performed as soon as possible. A careful histological examination is required to differentiate RMS from other more frequent and aggressive lesions affecting the concerned site. For the head and neck region, the embryonal subtype is most commonly found and frequently occurs in children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Once a diagnosis is made, a combined, multimodal therapeutic approach involving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is needed for the management of RMS. The basic goal of RMS therapy is locoregional control, and prevention or treatment of systemic metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pulmonary metastasized poorly differentiated RMS of the nasopharynx in an adult patient. This case report demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach in cases of rare malignancies. Early image studies and timely biopsies should be of notice when RMS is suspected to accelerate the start of a targeted and appropriate therapy. Physicians should be aware of various atypical presentations of rare malignancies, so that further measures can be taken. Nasopharyngeal RMS, although very rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adult patients.\n\n【17】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【18】None.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【20】None declared.\n\n【21】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【22】Professor Matthias, Professor of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.\n\n【23】PATIENT CONSENT FORM\n--------------------\n\n【24】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Breast-conserving surgery was performed. Pathological diagnosis revealed stage IA IDC with a predominant intraductal component (pT1aN0M0), arising from FA. In conclusion, we encountered an extremely rare case of HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA in which pathological infiltration was difficult to predict based on preoperative imaging.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Fibroadenoma (FA) is one of the most common benign breast tumors with a peak age of onset between 15 and 35 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Breast cancer rarely arises from FA and is detected only in 0.02–0.125% of FA-related cases, usually in patients over 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, clinical, sonographic and mammographic findings are similar to those of FA alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, thereby complicating cancer detection. There is no consensus on subtypes distribution of this disease, and hormone receptor-positive rates may not differ significantly from common breast cancer (estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 68.8%; progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive, 62.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. However, almost all cases, in which subtypes have been reported are of luminal or triple-negative types, were negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Herein, we report a rare case of HER2-positive early breast cancer arising from FA.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old woman presented without any medical or family history of cancer. Approximately, 1 year before her current presentation, a 13-mm-sized left breast mass was detected on breast screening , classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3. The patient was diagnosed with FA based on imaging alone. Follow-up imaging revealed mass enlargement and presence of new calcifications , which prompted core needle biopsy. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was diagnosed, and immunohistochemical staining revealed an HER2 score of 3+ (HER2-positive), without ER or PgR expression. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of axillary lymph nodes suggested no evidence of metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a maximum lesion diameter of 22 mm. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed absence of distant metastasis. Thus, stage IIA HER2-positive IDC (cT2N0M0) was diagnosed. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was considered, upfront breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed based on the patient’s preference. The patient refused genetic testing for hereditary cancers. The excised specimen surface contained a relatively well-circumscribed, grey-white and solid 19-mm tumor . Histologically, this lobulated lesion had predominantly intraductal solid growth patterns of large carcinoma cells with marked coagulation necroses and calcium depositions . Carcinoma cells were polygonal, showing high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and irregular nuclei with distinct nucleoli. Infiltrating elements of histological grade 3, up to 4 mm, were observed in the lesion , with scattered microinvasive foci . On immunohistochemical examination, neoplastic cells were negative for ER and PgR (total Allred scores: 0 and 0, respectively) . The HER2 score was estimated to be 3+ in invasive and intraductal neoplastic cells , and the Ki67 (MIB-1) labeling index was 58.7%. Myoepithelial cells, positive for p63 and CD10, were identified in intraductal components. Based on these pathological findings, an invasive carcinoma of no special type, HER2 immuno-subtype, with a predominant intraductal component, derived from an intracanalicular FA was diagnosed. Since sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed absence of metastasis, the final diagnosis was stage IA IDC (pT1aN0M0). Pathological findings guided selection of weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab as adjuvant systemic therapy. Additionally, the patient underwent radiotherapy of the whole left breast (42.56 Gy) and tumor-bed boost irradiation (10.64 Gy), considering her age. Approximately 6 months following surgery, no apparent recurrence was noted.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Comparison between images of the left breast tumor taken 1 year earlier ( **a** and **b** ) and before the current operation ( **c** and **d** ) (a, c, mammogram (cranio-caudal view); b, d, ultrasonography).

First, breast cancer arising from FA could involve HER2-positive type; thus, chemotherapy with targeted therapy should be considered. Second, upfront surgery may be a useful guide for selecting appropriate systemic therapy.\n\n【17】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe an HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy. We conducted literature searches with PubMed using the keywords ‘fibroadenoma’ and ‘carcinoma’ to collect articles in English published between February 2013 and June 2021; for literature published between January 1986 and January 2013, we referred to the review by Wu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HER2-positive breast cancer arising from FA is extremely rare, with only one reported case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, a somewhat different case of coexistence of HER2-positive breast cancer, phyllodes tumor and FA has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, to date, no cases have mentioned a systemic treatment strategy.\n\n【18】Currently, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy is generally considered for HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. The number of patients receiving NAC has recently increased due to the potential for improving breast preservation rate and achieving pathological complete response with good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, chemotherapy de-escalation is another significant issue. Using non-anthracycline regimens has become a common option for low-risk patients because anthracycline-based regimens could cause cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Chemotherapy regimen is generally selected by considering the infiltration diameter of the tumor. However, since the histological type of this disease is mainly carcinoma _in situ_ or early invasive breast cancer, it is difficult to base this regimen selection on preoperative imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Wu _et al_ . reported a mean tumor diameter of breast cancer within FA of 2.46 cm. However, 33.3% of cases were pTis, and those with a known infiltration diameter were pT1a or pT1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our case, the actual infiltration diameter was only up to 4 mm (pT1a). However, the imaging-based tumor diameter was 22 mm (cT2). Therefore, upfront surgery could help in guiding the selection of a less intense non-anthracycline regimen. Furthermore, it may be a reasonable choice to avoid chemotherapy altogether.\n\n【20】It should be noted that even tumors with small infiltration diameter (pT1mi or pT1a) may involve lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. FNAC should be performed, if possible, since NAC may be a better approach when lymph node metastasis is detected. In our case, although mild lymphadenopathy was observed, FNAC did not reveal metastasis.\n\n【21】In conclusion, breast cancer arising from FA could present as an HER2-positive type; hence, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy should be considered. Upfront surgery may be useful in guiding selection of an appropriate adjuvant therapy, owing to difficulty in predicting infiltration diameter through preoperative imaging alone. It is unclear how breast cancers arise from FA and why these cases tend to more frequently involve HER2-negative subtype, and further research is required.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【23】We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】The authors’ COI are not related to this work.\n\n【26】Dr. Osaki reports personal fees from AstraZeneca K.K.; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.

However, cytotoxic chemotherapy might help control CD during the treatment period. Here, we report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer. A 39-year-old woman with CD controlled by infliximab and mesalazine was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Infliximab treatment was discontinued temporarily so that the patient could receive NAC. However, her CD symptoms intensified during chemotherapy, and after her symptoms improved after a one-time administration of infliximab, the remainder of NAC was completed with a corticosteroid. Bilateral breast conservation surgery was performed. Histopathological examination revealed partial response of the left breast cancer and no residual cancer in the right breast. Breast irradiation and hormone therapy were added and no signs of recurrence have been observed for 5 years. CD has been well controlled with adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. When a patient with CD is diagnosed with breast cancer, the management of both CD and breast cancer can be challenging. Generally, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (infliximab, adalimumab) for CD should be stopped during chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, because the use of anti-TNF agents, especially during treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, may cause severe immunosuppression. Previous reports suggested that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission during cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a case of CD relapse during treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bilateral breast cancer after interruption of infliximab.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 39-year-old pre-menopausal woman had CD, which has been well controlled by 5-mg/kg intravenous infliximab every 8 weeks and 2000 mg per day oral mesalazine for the last 7 years. She was referred to our hospital due to complaints of a palpable mass in the left breast. She had no family history.\n\n【6】Breast examination revealed a 3.5-cm lump in the left breast without swollen axillary lymph nodes. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 50-mm mass in the left breast and an 18-mm lesion in the right breast . Core needle biopsy (CNB) of the left breast tumor revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 5%. CNB of the right breast tumor revealed ductal carcinoma in situ that was ER-positive, PgR-positive and HER2-negative with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 7%. Computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy showed no findings of distant metastasis. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. BRCA genetic test was not performed because she had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. PI3K test and NGS were not performed because these were not covered by national health insurance in Japan.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】MRI findings; (A) initial breast MRI of the bilateral breast tumor; (B) tumor in the left breast after 4 cycles of taxane; (C) tumor in the left breast after the completion of NAC.\n\n【10】NAC consisting of taxane and anthracycline was scheduled to enable breast-conservation surgery, after temporary discontinuation of infliximab. She received NAC with 4 cycles of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks and was treated with mesalazine for CD. The left breast tumor decreased to 30 mm . However, at that time, she complained of slight-to-moderate abdominal distension and diarrhea 4–5 times per day and severe fatigue for 1 week. There were no other symptoms including fever or weight loss. Abdominal CT revealed mild ileus caused by small intestine stenosis , and her C-reactive protein level was 0.17 mg/dl, while her baseline was 0.01 mg/dl. The CD activity index was moderately active, which indicates exacerbated CD. NAC was temporarily interrupted, and 250-mg infliximab was administered once. CD remission was induced in 1 week. Eight weeks later, NAC consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) every 2 weeks was resumed with 40-mg predonine for CD. After the completion of NAC, the left breast tumor decreased to 8 mm . The patient underwent bilateral partial mastectomy and left sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection. Histopathological examination of surgical specimens showed a 40-mm IDC in the left breast and no residual cancer in the right breast.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】CT findings; abdominal CT showed mild ileus.\n\n【14】After surgery, she received adjuvant radiation therapy to both breasts and has remained on tamoxifen and leuprorelin. She has survived without any signs of breast cancer recurrence for 5 years. Her CD has also been well controlled by adalimumab and mesalazine.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This is a case report of CD relapse during NAC for breast cancer after interruption of infliximab. A breast cancer diagnosis in a patient with CD increases the difficulty in managing the treatment of both CD and breast cancer. The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization guideline suggested that anti-TNF agents should be stopped during chemotherapy because of their ability to aggravate the bone marrow suppression induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Previous studies reported that the risk of CD relapse after anti-TNF agent withdrawal ranged from 30 to 40% at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and that patients in long-standing stable remission probably had a lower risk of relapse after anti-TNF cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Axelrad _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported that cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may induce or maintain CD remission by causing cell death or preventing cell division in rapidly dividing cells such as T lymphocytes and malignant cells. Koc _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> also reported that of 41 patients, none showed exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease during chemotherapy. We chose NAC because chemotherapy is recommended over endocrine therapy for pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease who warrant neoadjuvant therapy by clinical evidence and guideline. We discontinued infliximab because this patient had maintained a long-term remission of CD and because the cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer could also effectively control CD through its immunosuppressant effect. However, CD symptoms intensified after discontinuation of infliximab even though the patient was receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. We supposed that infliximab was very effective in controlling CD in this patient. Although we should have ruled out the presence of other disease including cytomegalovirus and _Clostridium difficile_ infections, re-administration of infliximab was effective because these symptoms were due to CD relapse. Fecal calprotectin test was not performed because it was not covered by national health insurance in Japan. In cases where CD symptoms flare during chemotherapy, it is not clear whether corticosteroids or anti-TNF should be given 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although CD symptoms remitted after one-time administration of infliximab, a corticosteroid was used during continuation of NAC because combination of chemotherapy and infliximab might cause severe immunosuppression. Interleukin inhibitors were not approved for CD in Japan and might also cause severe immunosuppression in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n【17】This case report highlights the important suggestion that CD may relapse after interruption of infliximab treatment even during treatment with NAC for breast cancer. It is necessary to assess the appropriate management of breast cancer in patients with CD, as well as CD in patients with breast cancer.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【19】We thank Ms Akiko Yuzuriha for her excellent technical assistance.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】No funding was received for this report.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】Not applicable.\n\n【26】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【27】Informed consent for the publication of the case details was obtained from the patient.\n\n【28】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【29】H.J. is the guarantor of this report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A non-contrasted head CT was obtained, which demonstrated a hyperdense image compatible with an intracerebral hemorrhage in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe. The patient displayed no neurological deficit during the consultation and a subsequent MRI showed a temporoinsular bleeding lesion that was suggestive of an atypic meningioma or a metastatic lesion. Afterwards, neck, chest and abdomen CT scans were performed, and the imaging ruled out a secondary neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion, and a solid tumor was found with no bleeding associated. The pathology reported a WHO I fibroblastic meningioma.\n\n【2】fibroblastic meningioma , intracerebral hemorrhage , magnetic resonance image , computerized tomography\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Hemorrhagic strokes account for 15% of all strokes and are widely accepted to be deadlier than ischemic strokes. The 30-day mortality rate of patients presenting intracranial hemorrhage is ~50%, in comparison with an estimated 20% rate for patients that have experienced ischemic strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The most common cause of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is thought to be chronic hypertension. The small perforating end branches are especially vulnerable to damage from elevated blood pressure in locations such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and pons.\n\n【6】Although all brain tumors are known to convey a risk of bleeding, medical teams tend to associate tumoral intra-cerebral hemorrhages with the presence of malignancies. The types of malignant tumors that are most associated with localized hemorrhages are glioblastomas, lymphomas, oligodendrogliomas and metastatic tumors, the last of which encompass melanomas, choriocarcinomas, renal cell carcinomas and bronchogenic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Contrastingly, the types of benign tumors that have been associated with intracerebral hemorrhages include meningiomas, pituitary adenomas and hemangioblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】The factors that determine the prognosis and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the patient’s age, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, the location of hematoma and the presence of an intra-ventricular component. All the aforementioned factors are also considered to calculate the intracranial hemorrhage score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【9】A 50-year-old patient presented to the emergency room complaining of having suffered, for an entire day, from a sudden pulsatile hemicranial headache of moderate intensity, associated with nausea, no emetic episodes and that was also not responding to the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Due to the persistence of the symptomatology, the patient sought medical attention and the initial diagnosis suggested a secondary headache. After careful examination, the patient was found to be free of neurological deficit and the medical team performed a brain CT scan.\n\n【10】The resulting image documented a cortico-subcortical hyperdense lesion (50 Hounsfield Units) in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe, measuring 41 × 32 × 36 mm and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc, commonly associated with cases of vasogenic edema compromising the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The amplitude of the left lateral ventricle and the width of the regional subarachnoid space sulci had decreased on account of the lesion, and a minimal deviation of the midline structures to the right and incipient left uncal herniation was noted. To rule out an underlying vascular malformation, the medical team performed a CT angiogram, which did not show any aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.\n\n【11】**Figure 1**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Head computerized tomography CT.\n\n【14】Due to the absence of neurological deficit, the medical team propounded that a brain hemorrhage could not be adjudged as the sole etiology and subsequently ordered an MRI scan. The results revealed a lobulated mass with prominent enhancement after the gadolinium injection and marked hypo intensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information. A zone in contact with the internal bone table was observed at the lateral margin of the lesion, as well as various dark regions at the susceptibility weighted sequence, suggesting blood products or calcium. The FLAIR sequence showed significant surrounding vasogenic edema. The aforementioned characteristics were found to be consistent with an atypical meningioma or a metastatic lesion .\n\n【15】**Figure 2**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】MRI—fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence.\n\n【18】**Figure 3**\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】MRI—susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence.\n\n【21】**Figure 4**\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】MRI—gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequence.\n\n【24】Additional neck, chest and abdominal CT scans were performed, and the results allowed the ruling out of metastatic disease, furthermore, increasing the probability of an underlying primary tumor of the central nervous system. The patient underwent surgery, where resulted in the identification of a solid lesion, without an intra-tumoral hemorrhagic component, as previously suspected in accordance with the pre-operative imaging findings .\n\n【25】**Figure 5**\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】Macroscopic lesion.\n\n【28】**Figure 6**\n\n【29】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【30】Macroscopic lesion.\n\n【31】After the surgical intervention, the patient presented a stable neurological evolution with no apparent deterioration and was discharged following 4 days of post-operative surveillance. During the post-operative follow-up, the pathology report revealed the existence of spindle cells fascicles intersected along with variable collagen deposition and occasional cellular whorls 通用删除1(英):<u>(in the hematoxylin–eosin staining— Fig. 7 )</u>. The tumor also tested positive for EMA in patches and Vimentin . These findings were deemed compatible with the diagnosis of fibroblastic meningioma WHO I, emphasizing that they were not suggestive of anaplastic meningioma or atypical meningioma.\n\n【32】**Figure 7**\n\n【33】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【34】Hematoxylin–eosin staining.\n\n【35】**Figure 8**\n\n【36】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【37】Vimentin staining.\n\n【38】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【39】The radiological findings in this case are particularly intriguing, due to the fact that the initial evaluation suggested a large acute hemorrhagic component—because of its high density in scans (50 Hounsfield Units) and its marked hypointensity in the magnetic resonance sequences with T2 information—but, at the time of the surgical resection, a mass of solid consistency was found, without any type of hemorrhage.\n\n【40】Given that acute blood is markedly hyperdense in comparison to the brain parenchyma, its tomographic diagnosis regularly does not pose a high grade of difficulty for medical teams. However, in this case, we were faced with an entirely solid lesion that mimicked an intracerebral hemorrhage. The tests ordered by the medical team included a CT angiogram to rule out a possible vascular etiology, as the patient’s symptomatology was not consistent with a primary hemorrhage. In the authors’ opinion, this is the most significant aspect of this case study, in terms of its possible contribution to medical literature and its potential of serving as reference material for other healthcare professionals assessing patients who report a similar array of symptoms.\n\n【41】In developing nations, medical institutions are typically constrained by multiple external factors that directly compromise the availability of primary imaging techniques, such as MRI scanning. In cases where diagnostic MRI equipment is found to be entirely unavailable, medical teams must judiciously evaluate each patient’s condition, to determine whether he should be immediately referred to a higher level facility or remain under surveillance after a CT scan. In this case, the patient presented to the ER with a diagnosis of a ‘large intracerebral hemorrhage’ but displayed no neurological deficit. Such a scenario was deemed unlikely by the medical team, given the absence of cognitive impairment, and thus, the symptoms were thought to be the result of a slow-growing lesion.\n\n【42】In accordance with the findings of this case, the authors pose that all medical teams evaluating the results of a Head CT scan must consider the correlation between the images and the patient’s neurological status (i.e. a patient with no neurological deficit, associated with a large hyperdense lesion, most probably relates to a tumor with intra-lesional hemorrhage, rather than a single hemorrhage). Additionally, this case allowed the authors to identify a valuable opportunity in the development of a computer-based algorithm—specially directed at medical centers with CT scanners, but lacking MRI imaging equipment—which marks the cases in which an extra imaging study should be ordered, starting with those ‘hyperdense lesions’ located in eloquent areas with no neurological deficit association.\n\n【43】As it was stated before, the patient’s neurological status during admission was undamaged, which is highly unlikely in patients with hemorrhages in the same location and with an approximate volume of 24.5 cc. Had that been the case for our patient, at least, a minimum degree of neurological compromise would have been expected, as the volume of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage is directly proportional to morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】Type III collagen is a member of the fibrillar collagen family and is colocalized with the most abundant member of the family, type I collagen, in such tissues as blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, leading the medical team to the conclusion that the high content of intercellular collagen and reticulin was the most probable cause for the hyperdensity evidenced in the tomographic image and the hypodensity on T2 weighted images, and for the dark areas evidenced on the susceptibility weighted images, thereby mimicking an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage.\n\n【45】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【46】The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Julian Gualdrón-Durán in the edition and preparation of this manuscript.\n\n【47】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【48】None declared.\n\n【49】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【50】None declared.\n\n【51】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【52】The case report was reviewed and accepted by the institutional review board from our institution.\n\n【53】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【54】Full verbal and written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for submission of this manuscript for publication.\n\n【55】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【56】Dr Oscar Hernando Feo-Lee is acting as a guarantor for this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although it is considered one of the most fatal tumors in the world, its early diagnosis is associated with a better prognosis and overall survival. A 49-year-old man was admitted to the dermatology department with a 15 cm lesion on the left arm. It was growing on a congenital nevus to reach an enormous size. Surgical excision was not possible and the treatment was controversial as the patient showed unpredicted resistance to immunotherapy. Further evaluations revealed false-negative BRAF mutation, which completely changed the course of treatment. Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer. Although there is no decisive definition of giant melanoma, some authors define it as a lesion of more than 10 cm in diameter. Through the literature, only a few cases of giant melanoma on the arm have been reported. Through our paper, we are revealing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma and confirming the significant role of regular follow-up for patients with a congenital melanocytic nevus. Moreover, we are showing the importance of having alternative methods for detecting BRAF mutations to avoid false-negative results and have better outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Malignant melanoma represents only about 1% of all skin cancers and <1% grows on a congenital nevus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, melanoma is an aggressive tumor and its incidence is increasing. It usually tends to grow rapidly but rarely measures more than 10 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, we reported a giant pigmented nodular melanoma that was neglected and disregarded, and it grew on a congenital nevus.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male was presented to our clinic with a wide ulcerated skin lesion on the upper area of the left arm. It started 6 months earlier on a congenital nevus, which remained unchanged since birth. There were no skin tumors in his family history. Laboratory tests were within the normal range. Physical examination showed a reddish-brown to black-colored, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion. It measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 2 cm in the left deltoid area .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Clinical image showing a giant cutaneous lesion, vegetative and erupted with irregular borders lesion.\n\n【9】There were many differential diagnoses. Nodular melanoma appears as an amelanotic symmetrical and well-circumscribed papule or nodule with a uniform color, although it can be melanotic and ulcerated occasionally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Lentigo maligna melanoma manifests as an irregular pigmented large patch or macule on sun damaged areas of the skin or as hypomelanotic/amelanotic papule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It arises from spindle-shaped junctional melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Superficial spreading melanoma presents as a scalloped, asymmetric and irregular papule or macule arising on previous nevi or developed _de novo_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】A cutaneous biopsy was performed and sent to the pathology department. Microscopic examination of the biopsy revealed proliferation of variably size nodules of malignant cells in the dermis . Infiltrated atypical polymorphic melanocytes with mild lymphoid inflammatory cells  and coarse brown pigments were observed . The malignant cells had large hyperchromatic nuclei with basophilic cytoplasm . To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains were applied. The tumor cells were positive for melanoma cocktail  and were negative for pan-cytokeratin . We did not perform dermoscopy because of its size and necrotic status, which pushed us to do the biopsy as early as possible.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Hematoxylin and eosin stain ( **A** – **D** ) and IHC ( **E** and **F** ): Microscopic images of cutaneous biopsy.

(E) The tumor cells are positive for melanoma cocktail (×100). (F) Pan-cytokeratin (CK) is negative (×100).\n\n【14】By performing the radiological investigation, positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan revealed hypermetabolic lesions with local and distant metastases to the lymph nodes, liver and bone , while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was within normal limits.\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan revealed hypermetabolic lesions. It shows local and distant metastases to the lymph nodes, liver and bone.\n\n【18】BRAF mutation analysis was performed and the result was negative for BRAF V600E. Therefore, targeted therapy with anti-BRAF drugs was excluded and the patient underwent chemotherapy with dacarbazine 250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1 → D5. A good response started after two courses but the patient had rapid progression after initiating the third course, which encouraged us to change the protocol to paclitaxel 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15 and carboplatin 150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> D1, D8, D15, but there was no response. At that stage, the patient suffered from disabled left arm due to severe pain and edema. Immunotherapy with nivolumab 280 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> was initiated, but unfortunately, there was no response observed after three courses. Surgical consultation claimed that surgical intervention is inapplicable due to locally advanced disease. Another wedge biopsy was taken for further histopathology evaluation. The result was identical to the first biopsy. The tumor was invading to anatomic level (at least V-Clark) and a measured depth (at least 3.5 cm-Breslow). The second BRAF mutation analysis, in contrast to the first one, came positive for BRAF V600E mutation. Targeted therapy with vemurafenib 960 mg was initiated. A significant response was noted within 2 weeks, including the appearance , edema, pain and distant metastases. Three months later, a brain MRI showed multiple lesions in both brain lobes and the brainstem with altered mental status and confusion. Unfortunately, the patient deteriorated rapidly and died due to complications of his brain metastases.\n\n【19】Figure 4\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Clinical image shows very good response and the lesion has regressed properly after 1 month of targeted therapy.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】Cutaneous melanoma is a rare malignancy, accounting only for 1% of skin cancer cases, and having it arising on a pre-existing congenital nevus is even much rarer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although there is no decisive definition of giant melanoma, some authors define it as a lesion of more than 10 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Through the literature, only a few cases of giant melanoma on the arm have been reported. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. 50–70% of melanomas have positive BRAF mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Better survival and a quicker response to treatment in patients with positive BRAF mutation had been reported after the development of the BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The BRAF gene organizes and adjusts the division and senescence of the cells to prevent the proliferation of cancer precursor cells, by encoding a protein kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The deregulation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway occurs when the BRAF mutation gets activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. V600E type is the most observed BRAF mutation in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the lesion has been neglected by the patient, evolving rapidly to reach an enormous size. Such growing on a congenital nevus may have been a contributing factor in the ignorance of this lesion. A false-negative BRAF mutation result, using polymerase chain reaction, led us to exclude targeted therapy. Unresponsiveness to immunotherapy was unjustified, which guide us to order a second BRAF mutation analysis, and in contrast to the first one, it came positive for BRAF mutation. False-negative BRAF mutation results can be a threatening problem, eventuating in delayed treatment and poor outcomes. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using VE1, unlike DNA-based techniques, recognizes the therapeutic target protein and estimates its expression in malignant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, IHC is less expensive, can be used on fewer tumor cells, is simpler and has faster results compared to DNA-based techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, IHC using VE1 can only detect the V600E mutation. Therefore, combining both, DNA-based techniques and IHC using VE1 can lead to more accurate results in BRAF mutation analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【25】Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive type of skin cancer that can arise from a pre-existing congenital nevus. Our case reveals the significant role of regular follow-up on any pigmented skin lesions, especially melanocytic nevus. Furthermore, it indicates the importance of having alternative methods for detecting BRAF mutations to avoid false-negative results and therefore have better outcomes.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】REGISTRATION OF RESEARCH STUDIES\n--------------------------------\n\n【31】Not applicable.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

We describe a 73-year-old woman who presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and melena. A computed tomography scan revealed a hypodense lesion, measuring 6 × 6 × 5 cm, along the upper part of the stomach. An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion, measuring 8 × 6 cm, between the cardia and body of the stomach. Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion, consistent with a lipoma, in the body of the stomach. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. A laparoscopy was offered, and a wedge resection was performed. A histopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lipomatous tumor in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and her hemoglobin level subsequently returned to normal. Overall, clinicians may be unfamiliar with GA because patients may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. Physicians should be aware of the characteristic histopathological features to distinguish GA from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Angiolipomas are subcutaneous benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract have been reported in the liver, and only a few cases of gastric angiolipomas (GA) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. A gastric angiolipoma almost exclusively occurs as a solitary lesion, and patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms. Some patients may be asymptomatic, whereas others may have signs and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. We report a case of gastric angiolipoma in a patient who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with a 3-day history of fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools. The patient denied any history of hematemesis, per rectal bleeding, fever or weight loss. She also denied any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, heart burn or reflux disease. Her family history was non-contributive. A review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【6】On examination, she was conscious, oriented, alert and did not show signs of respiratory distress. She looked pale but her vital signs were stable. Cardiovascular and chest examinations were unremarkable. Her abdomen was mildly distended and soft on palpation. It was not tender to palpation and bowel sounds were normal. Her initial workup revealed anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 6.4 g/dl. An abdominal X-ray reveled a normal distribution of bowel gas.\n\n【7】The patient was initially resuscitated successfully. She received 2 l of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells, which resulted in an improvement of her hemoglobin level to 7.5 g/dl. She was also started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy before performing further investigations.\n\n【8】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, chest and pelvis revealed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper part of the stomach . The lesion showed mostly fatty density and multiple lymph node enlargements surrounding the stomach and gastrohepatic ligament, with the largest one measuring 1 cm. The chest and pelvis were unremarkable.\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】A CT scan of the abdomen showed a hypodense lesion measuring 6 × 6 × 5-cm along the upper stomach.\n\n【12】An upper endoscopy revealed a large polypoid lesion measuring 8 × 6 cm between the cardia and body of the stomach . Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, and a histopathological examination showed an acute erosive helicobacter-associated reactive gastritis but no definitive atypia. A linear endoscopic ultrasound revealed a large, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with circumscribed margins in the body of the stomach, consistent with a lipoma. A fine needle aspiration was negative for malignancy. Endoscopic resection was not suitable in this case lesion too large, that's why laparoscopic resection was chosen here.\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Upper endoscopy images showing a large polypoid mass.\n\n【16】A laparoscopy identified a mass in the midsection of the greater curvature of the stomach. LigaSure™ was used to release the omentum from the greater curvature. Next a wedge resection was done by using Endo GIA size 60 (purple). A gross evaluation revealed a homogeneous, yellow-tan colored, fatty mass measuring 6 × 5 × 4 cm, with no area of hemorrhage or necrosis. A histopathological examination revealed a well-demarcated encapsulated lipomatous tumor arising in the gastric submucosa with focal mucosal ulceration .\n\n【17】Figure 3\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Histopathological section of the specimen (hematoxylin and eosin staining) showing varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels ( **A** ). Magnified image of the specimen ( **B** ).\n\n【20】The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was followed up twice after surgery. Her symptoms completely resolved, and her hemoglobin level was stable at 12 g/dl.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Angiolipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are a rare entity composed of mature fat cells and proliferating cells that are usually found in the gastric antrum. The symptoms associated with GA are nonspecific and may range from dyspepsia, vague abdominal discomfort, pain, cramping, bloating and gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–6 \\]</u>. Anemia is also common in these patients and is usually the result of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The patient in our case presented with fatiguability, epigastric pain and dark-colored stools, which is characteristic in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although our patient presented with a 3-day history of melena and had severe anemia requiring resuscitation, she may have had occult blood in her stool that went undetected until the tumor caused mucosal ulceration and massive bleeding.\n\n【23】On ultrasonography, an angiolipoma appears as a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous, hyperechoic mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The findings on an abdominal CT are usually variable, with the tumor generally appearing as a heterogenous mass with mixed soft tissue density and fat. The lesion in this patient’s case appeared as a solitary, homogenous, hyperechoic lesion with smooth borders on a linear endoscopic ultrasound. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hypodense lesion that showed mostly fatty density. Generally, the density of an angiolipoma can vary on CT based on the proportion of the tumor’s components, making it challenging to reach a diagnosis pre-operatively. Thus, the diagnosis is usually made intraoperatively and confirmed following a histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】On gross examination, an angiolipoma is a well-defined, encapsulated mass and its cut surface has a yellowish to reddish appearance based on its fat or vascular component. The tumor is composed of mature adipose cells interspersed with proliferating blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In some cases, fibrin thrombi are observed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections is central to determining the varying proportions of adipose tissue, smooth muscle and blood vessels in the tumor. However, immunohistochemical examination is rarely required.\n\n【25】The treatment of angiolipoma depends on the tumor size. In patients with small pedunculated polyps, an endoscopic resection can be offered. However, the diagnosis is usually discovered late when patients already present with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction, making it challenging to perform an endoscopic resection. Given the increased risk of hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation, endoscopic resection may not be recommended for large tumors or those with wide implantation bases. In these cases, it may be more beneficial to surgically excise the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. An excellent prognosis has been reported following surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>, as was the case in our patient, whose symptoms resolved completely after laparoscopy.\n\n【26】Overall, patients with GA may present with signs and symptoms that can be confused with other gastrointestinal conditions. This underscores the need for physicians to be aware of the characteristic histopathological features of this tumor to distinguish it from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that may share similar clinical or radiologic features.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【28】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】None declared.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】The Research Ethics Committee of Security Forces Hospital approved the report.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】A written consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【35】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【36】Saeed Abdulrahman Alghamdi is the guarantor of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In this article we discuss a case of 8-year-old girl presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms and a history of hospital admission of fatigue and dehydration. She was incidentally found to have hypertension and hypokalemia. After an endocrine workup her biochemical tests showed: metabolic alkalosis, low levels of cortisol, high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with normal female phenotype and (46,XY) karyotype. These findings led to the diagnosis of 17OHD confirmed by regression of hypertension and hypokalemia with hydrocortisone prescription. This case shows the importance of vital signs measurement, medical history and commitment to a systematic approach.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of disorders resulting from defect of one of enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of cortisol. A 17 hydroxylase/17.20-lyase deficiency is a rare form of CAH, accounts about 1% of all cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is an autosomal recessive defect in the cytochrome P450 17A1 enzyme which leads to impaired cortisol and sex steroid synthesis, with compensative elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), gonadotropins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC). In severe forms, patients usually have female phenotype and present with primary amenorrhea and absence of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients may have either a 46XX OR 46XY karyotype. We present a case of incidental diagnosis of (17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency \\[17 OHD\\]) in a normal female phenotype child (46, XY karyotype) with hypokalemic hypertension.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 8-year-old girl presented in pediatric clinic with upper respiratory infection symptoms: fever, cough, rhinorrhea and pharyngodynia, no other accompanying signs or symptoms, a medical history of hospital admission of dehydration and fatigue, family history: older 14-year-old female sibling with uninvestigated primary amenorrhea and absence of secondary sexual characteristics. On physical examination: weight: 28 kg (69.497th percentile), height: 130 cm (62.225th percentile), BP 150/90 mmHg (99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg), Tanner stage: breast papilla elevation only (Stage1), pubic Hair: no pubic hair (Stage1), normal female external genitalia. Laboratory investigations: sodium = 142.78 mmol/L, potassium = 2.6 mmol/L, arterial blood gas (ph = 7.49, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 22, PaO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 96), Cortisol A.M = 3.09 ug/dl (normal = 6.2–19.4), ACTH = 198.3 pg/ml (normal = 5–60), aldosterone (standing) = 335.9 pg/ml (normal: supine = 10–160, standing = 35–300), plasma renin activity (PRA) (erect) = 0.61 ng/ml/h (normal: erect 0.98–4.18, supine: 0.51–2.64), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 31.65 mlU/ml (normal = 0.3–11), normal thyroid functions, metanephrine in 24 h urine sample = 0.79 (normal: up to 1), DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) = 2.47 ug/dl (normal: males 6–9 years: 10–85 ug/dl, females 6–9 years: 13–114), 17-OH progesterone (17-OHP) =0.411 ng/ml (normal prepubertal: 0.07–153). Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound revealed no evidence of ureteral or ovarian tissues. Renal artery echo Doppler was within normal in both sides. Normal male karyotype (46,XY). Combination of hypokalemic hypertension, high aldosterone, low cortisol, high ACTH, high FSH and normal male karyotype (46XY) in a normal female phenotype at childhood led to the diagnosis of 17OHD. The patient was prescribed low dose hydrocortisone (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> /day). After 3 months of treatment, a remarkable regression of high blood pressure value to normal range measuring 100/60 mm HG, biochemical laboratory tests showed: PRA (standing) = 4.12 ng/ml/h, aldosterone 256.9 pg/ml (normal: supine = 10–160, standing = 35–300) compared to 0.61 ng/ml/h, 335.9 pg/ml, respectively before treatment.\n\n【6】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【7】Severe forms of 17OHD classically manifest in phenotypic females (who can have XX or XY) with: hypertension usually detected in early adulthood and can be severe, primary amenorrhea, absence of secondary sexual characteristics and minimal body hair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Partial forms of 17OHD in 46XY patients (undervirilized male) present with: ambiguous genitalia, intra-abdominal or inguinal testes and blind vaginal pouch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Mullerian structures (fallopian tubes, uterus and upper third of vagina) are absent due to normal production of mullerian inhibitory factor from testes. Deficient testosterone production explains development of external female genitals. 17OHD blocks synthesis pathways of cortisol and sexual hormones and induces the mineralocorticoid pathway synthesis resulting in decreasing of 17-OH pregnolone, 17-OHP, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, DHEA-S, androstenedione, testosterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and overproduction of 17-deoxysteroids by the adrenal cortex including DOC, corticosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5,6 </sup></u> (18 OHB) . High level of DOC induces sodium and fluid retention and loss of potassium and consequently hypertension because of its mineralocorticoid effect. Although low level of cortisone, patients with 17OHD rarely have adrenal crises because of corticosterone elevated levels of has some glucocorticoid activity preventing adrenal crises 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most 17OHD patients have low aldosterone levels caused by increased levels of DOCs leading to suppression of renin angiotensin system. However, some cases reported high aldosterone levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Yamakita _et al_ . explained the pathophysiology of high aldosterone levels with conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone by the elevated activity of corticosterone methyl oxidase produced by fasciculata cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our case presented with incidentally discovered hypokalemic hypertension which was studied based on this differential diagnosis: CAH, primary aldosteronism, Cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Liddle syndrome, renal vascular disease, androgen insensitivity syndrome and 5a reductase deficiency. Laboratory investigations and imaging tests revealed: normal kidney artery resistance, normal 24 h urine metanephrine sample = 0.79 excluding the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, low cortisol A.M = 3.09 Ug/dl excluding the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome, high Aldosterone (standing) =335.9 pg/ml), low DHEA-S = 2.47ug/dl. These results led us to investigate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis; ACTH = 198.3 pg/ml, FSH = 31.65 mlU/ml. Decreased DHEA-S results in decreased testosterone excluding androgen insensitivity syndrome and 5a reductase deficiency. The elevated ACTH level, low cortisol level, low DHEA-S level, high FSH level suggest suppression of both axes of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis. All these results in combination with hypokalemic hypertension led to the diagnosis of CAH with 17 OHD. Pelvic imaging revealed absence of uterus, ovarian tubes and cervix. Chromosome analysis revealed 46, XY karyotype. We were unable to perform plasma levels of DOC and 18 OHB which could confirm the diagnosis but as described earlier, clinical and available biochemical results supported the diagnosis of CAH due to 17OHD. Patients with 17 OHD have tall stature due to sex steroid deficiency causing epiphysis fusion failure; our patient’s stature is within normal percentile similar to reported cases of 17 OHD patients with short or normal stature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Hypertension usually resolves with glucocorticoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> therapy therefore the patient was treated with low-dose hydrocortisone (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> /day) and a remarkable regression of high blood pressure, elevation of potassium serum within normal range, reduction of aldosterone level was noticed which supports the diagnosis of 17 a hydroxylase deficiency. At puberty age, development of female secondary sexual characteristic in 46,XY patients is induced by prescribing low-dose 17 beta estradiol patch (6.25 mcg/day) increased gradually every 6 months to reach target dose (25 mcg/day).

We treated a patient with a partial-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon by a series of four type I porcine collagen ultrasound-guided injections, at weekly intervals. At the same time the patient underwent physical therapy, consisting of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises. The patient was assessed before the treatment and up to 18 months after the last injection by the Constant–Murley score, the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and ultrasonography. Shoulder pain and functional limitation progressively improved and they almost completely disappeared at the last follow-up. Ultrasonography showed a gradual healing of the partial-thickness tear and a regeneration of the tendon structure. This is the first study on ultrasound-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Future research should confirm the excellent result achieved in this case report.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Partial-thickness rotator cuff tear (PTRCT) is one of the most common shoulder injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The supraspinatus (SSP) tendon is the most affected in PTRCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The treatment of PTRCTs remains disputed; non-operative treatment is the first approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Many injectable therapies have been proposed in the last years with controversial effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. According to literature, this is the first study on ultrasound (US)-guided injections of type I porcine collagen for the treatment of PTRCTs.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】In March 2018, a 55-year-old right-handed housewife came to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Practice complaining of pain and functional limitation in the left shoulder, lasting 2 months. She didn’t report neither systemic or genetic disorders, nor previous traumas or surgical interventions and nor allergies or intolerances. She suffered from hypothyroidism and she was in treatment with sodium levothyroxine. She didn’t smoke. She was habitually practising free-body gymnastics twice a week. She had already treated the shoulder pain with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, without improvements.\n\n【6】Based on physical examination we suspected left SSP tendon involvement. We excluded glenohumeral osteoarthritis by X-rays. Shoulder ultrasonography, performed by a radiologist with >20 years of experience in skeletal muscle US, revealed a partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the SSP tendon (Grade II according to Ellman classification). We decided to treat the patient with a series of four US-guided intratendineous injections of 2-ml porcine type I collagen at weekly intervals in combination with physical therapy. After a full and clear description of the study, the patient was invited to sign the informed consent.\n\n【7】Injections were performed by a single doctor with >10 years of experience using an anterior approach. The patient was seated on a chair with the arm in internal rotation in order to expose as much of the SSP tendon as possible. This position was best achieved by placing the patient’s arm behind her back. A 22-gauge needle was directed towards the tear of the SSP tendon as guided by US until the tip of the needle was seen in the correct position and then the collagen was injected slowly.\n\n【8】Physiokinesitherapy was performed starting from the first injection and during 4 weeks, three times a week, 30 minutes per session and consisted of motor re-education and proprioceptive exercises, with the aim to recover range of motion and strength of the shoulder.\n\n【9】The patient was evaluated at the time of enrolment (T0), right before the third injection (T1), and 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after the last injection by means of the Constant–Murley (CM) score and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Clinical data are reported in Table 1 and their trends illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\n【10】Table 1\n\n【11】CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【14】Open in new tab\n\n【15】Table 1\n\n【16】CM score and DASH questionnaire values\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n| . | T0 . | T1 . | T2 . | T3 . | T4 . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CM score** | 47 | 52 | 77 | 84 | 97 |\n| **DASH score** | 57 | 48 | 36 | 34 | 4 |\n\n【19】Open in new tab\n\n【20】**Figure 1**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Outcome measures of the CM score and the DASH questionnaire over the time.\n\n【23】US assessment was performed at T0, T3 and T4 by the same expert radiologist. As shown in Fig. 2 , longitudinal US of the SSP tendon at T0 showed a well-defined hypoechoic area, indicating partial-thickness tear of the articular surface of the tendon, without retraction (Grade II according to Ellman classification). Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (Grade I according to Ellman classification). Eventually, the T4 US assessment no longer showed tear within the tendon, which in addition appeared quite regular and isoechoic.\n\n【24】**Figure 2**\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】US assessment of the SSP tendon across multiple follow-up intervals.

( **b** ) Three months following the last injection, the partial-thickness tear became smaller and less defined (arrow). ( **c** ) At 18-month follow-up, the tendon looked quite regular and isoechoic, without any sign of tear (arrow).\n\n【27】The patient was totally compliant, following all the appointments given. No adverse events have been described after collagen injections.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】According to literature, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of shoulder US on rotator cuff tear detection has a range of 46–95% and 50–95%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The variability is highly correlated with the level of experience of the operator and the patterns of the rotator cuff tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Non-operative treatment is the first approach to PTRCTs, and surgical option has to be considered when the conservative treatment has not effect within the first 6–12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical therapy is the first-line treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rest from exacerbating activity, especially repetitive overhead activity and heavy lifting, can improve the pain component. Cortisone injections may be helpful in alleviating pain in conjunction with physical therapy but offer only short-term effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Different injectable therapies have been proposed in the past years for the treatment of PRTCTs (e.g. hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, prolotherapy), but they have achieved controversial effectiveness according to literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】We have decided to treat the PTRCT of our patient with type I collagen injections on the base of (i) the positive effect proved by injectable collagen on the tendon structure of cultured tenocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; (ii) the good results achieved by collagen patches implanted arthroscopically in the treatment of large and massive RC tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and (iii) the promising outcomes of collagen injections in the treatment of epicondylitis and SSP tendinopathy without tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Studies of degenerative tendons have found a small but significant decrease in the total collagen content and an increased proportion of collagen type III relative to collagen type I. The increase in the collagen type III to collagen type I ratio was consistent with smaller, less organized and weaker tendons.\n\n【33】This case report has one main limitation: the patient was not previously treated with other injective therapies; so, we cannot state that the positive effect on the PTRCT is certainly due to type I porcine collagen only. It is well known indeed that tendon needling is able to disrupt the chronic degenerative process of tendinopathies favouring localized bleeding and fibroblastic proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, no data exist on the benefits of tendon needling as a stand-alone treatment for tendon tears.\n\n【34】In conclusion, the tear healing, the improvement in the tendon structure, the clinical and functional positive outcomes and the absence of side effects allow us to propose collagen injections as a valid option for the treatment of PTRCTs. A regenerative effect of collagen injections on tendon structure may be assumed to account the results achieved. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n【35】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【36】None declared.\n\n【37】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【38】No approval was required.\n\n【39】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【40】An informed patient consent has been completed and it is held by the treating institution.\n\n【41】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【42】Bruno Corrado.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Metastases to the thyroid gland are rare, representing less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies. Here, we report a case of a 69-year-old Asian man who had both thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders but no nodules/tumours in the lung field. The patient died 51 days after his first visit to our office, although pembrolizumab was administered on day 34 based on programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with paired box 8 (PAX8) may be useful to diagnostically distinguish poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas from napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cancers of unknown primary (CUPs) are metastatic tumours whose primary site cannot be identified during pretreatment evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary account for approximately 70% of CUPs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The median survival of patients with adenocarcinomas is 3 months, with a 17% 1-year survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】When tumour(s) are identified within the thyroid gland, metastases to the thyroid gland or secondary involvement by direct extension from a nonthyroid malignancy in the neck must be considered. However, metastases to the thyroid gland represent less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Common primary sites for thyroid metastases include the kidneys, head, neck (squamous cell carcinomas), lung and breast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of neck stiffness at his first visit to our office and died after an aggressive disease course. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed no nodules/tumours in the lung field but thyroid gland and lymph node enlargement in the neck and shoulders. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies from the thyroid tumour and from a subcutaneous tumour in the left shoulder revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) suggested that the tumour was likely a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 69-year-old Asian man was referred to our office for neck stiffness and persistent coughing for over a month. His past medical history was significant for gastric and duodenal ulcers that improved after _H. pylori_ eradication. He had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 50 years. His physical examination revealed subcutaneous, board-like indurations and nodules/tumours without bilateral supraclavicular and cervical tenderness.\n\n【8】Contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland (i.e. a thyroid tumour), which displaced the trachea to the left side and subcutaneous nodules/tumours that displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle anteriorly . High-resolution CT scanning revealed no nodules/tumours in the lung field as shown in Video 1 of the supplementary material . To clarify the cytopathological features of the subcutaneous nodules/tumours, the patient was referred to our otolaryngologist, who performed fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies on the subcutaneous tumour in the left supraclavicular region as well as on the thyroid tumour .\n\n【9】Figure 1:\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Contrast-enhanced CT scan showing the thyroid tumour (yellow arrow) and subcutaneous nodules/tumours in the left supraclavicular region . The thyroid gland and lymph nodes were enlarged in the neck and shoulders.\n\n【12】Nine days after his first visit to our office, the patient was transferred to our emergency department by ambulance due to severe chest tightness. Cardiac echography and a plain CT scan showed cardiac tamponade (data not shown); therefore, continuous pericardial drainage was performed.\n\n【13】Figure 2:\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Plain CT scan showing the cardiac tamponade caused by pericardial effusion (yellow arrow) and pleural effusion . The pericardial effusion displaced the cardiac muscle.\n\n【16】Cytological analysis of the FNA biopsies of the subcutaneous and thyroid tumours as well as of the pericardial effusion, indicated a CUP, possibly an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (data not shown).\n\n【17】On day 12, an excisional biopsy was performed for extensive IHC analyses on the subcutaneous tumours in the left supraclavicular region . Table 1 summarizes the IHC results for pan-keratin antibodies AE1 and AE3 (AE1/3), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, vimentin, calretinin, p40, paired box 8 (PAX8), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). (PAX8 staining was performed after the patient was deceased.) The patient’s serum CEA levels were 13.4 ng/ml (day 1), 520.5 ng/ml (day 10) and 596.6 ng/ml (day 50).\n\n【18】Figure 3:\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of a subcutaneous tumour in the left supraclavicular region.

TTF-1 and napsin A positivity are reported to reliably enable distinguishing primary from metastatic tumours of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Napsin A expression was less intense and partially positive in the patient, while TTF-1 was positive . Napsin A has a higher specificity of 96% but a lower sensitivity of 65% for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma compared with TTF-1 expression (81% for each measure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas may be napsin A-positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. TTF-1 is also positive in thyroid tumours, regardless of histologic type, and in lung carcinomas, including 75% of adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, PAX8 may have a crucial role in diagnostically distinguishing napsin A-positive thyroid carcinomas from lung adenocarcinomas, which are PAX8 negative, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. PAX8 stain positivity is also diagnostically useful for müllerian, renal, and thymic carcinomas and pancreatic endocrine tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Further, thyroglobulin staining might be useful for distinguishing thyroid from lung primaries if differentiation to mature thyroid glands is partially preserved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】Pembrolizumab was reported to result in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The patient, however, died 17 days after receiving pembrolizumab. Since the time to response for pembrolizumab is 1.4 to 8.2 months (median, 2.2 months) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, using pembrolizumab to treat CUPs may be difficult even if the tumour cells show a strong intensity and are 100% positive for PD-L1 expression.\n\n【49】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【50】The authors thank Dr Tomohiro Goda, Department of Medical Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine for the ALK, PD-L1 and PAX8 staining and for the genetic analyses of the EGFR gene and ROS1 gene fusion.

We report a case of a 55-year-old woman who presented to hospital with headaches, petechial rashes and bruising—7 days after receiving her first vaccine dose. Blood tests showed low platelets, a markedly high d-dimer and positive anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies. Computed tomography (CT) of head and venogram showed features consistent with venous sinus thrombosis. She was immediately started on IV pooled immunoglobulin therapy, high-dose prednisolone and full anticoagulation. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of head and venogram supported the initial CT findings, with features suggestive of a small-volume venous sinus thrombosis. Additionally, CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a right-sided segmental pulmonary embolism. Our case highlights the importance of increased awareness of this complication after covid vaccination and how searching for distal thrombotic events and liaison with tertiary centres influence clinical outcomes.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The global outbreak of coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), prompted the development of several vaccinations to reduce the prevalence and serious adverse effects of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In February 2021, several cases of thrombotic events were noted after the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccination—a recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral vector encoding the glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The European Medicines Agency reported rare thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after receipt of the AstraZeneca vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the patient had antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes.\n\n【22】Computed tomography (CT) of head revealed no abnormality, while CT of venogram showed an apparent filling defect extending within the right sigmoid sinus concerning of venous sinus thrombosis with the possibility of arachnoid granulation. Additionally, there were features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with stenosis of the transverse sinuses bilaterally.\n\n【23】Due to the high suspicion of VITT, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was commenced at 1 g/kg with a second dose at 0.5 mg/kg and combined with oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg. Fondaparinux of 2.5 mg OD was started.\n\n【24】She underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head and venogram to confirm the CT findings. The initial report concluded that the filling defect noted on CT in the right sigmoid sinus was likely a slight granulation rather than thrombus. However, in view of the clinical suspicion of VITT, a second opinion was sought and the MRV was reported as suggestive of a small-volume venous sinus thrombosis . Fondaparinux was increased to 7.5 mg OD.\n\n【25】Due to the rarity of this complication, her case was discussed with a tertiary centre who advised to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【26】CTPA confirmed a right-sided subsegmental pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of mesenteric or portal venous thrombosis. Concurrently, she underwent a ultrasound doppler of her right leg due to swelling, which ruled out a deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【27】Platelet levels began to improve significantly after the second dose of IVIG  and her symptoms improved. Fondaparinux was continued (4 days total) until discharge.\n\n【28】She was then started on apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 1 week, which was reduced to 5 mg twice daily, and on a prednisolone weaning regimen. Weekly blood tests showed her platelet counts remained within normal limits and her d-dimer had normalized (d-dimer levels of 23 704–376 after 21 days between 13 April and 11 May). She remains on long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【30】This report describes a case of VITT post-administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine in a 55-year-old woman with no history or risk factors for VTE.\n\n【31】This case, as well as other reported incidences, appear to be specific for vaccination. A study in Norway reported that after 132 686 first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were administered, five patients were admitted to hospital after 7–10 days after receiving the dose with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. All five patients had significantly high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies to PF4 and platelet activation, with no prior exposure to heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The association between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the risk of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events was also assessed in a study using patient level data for ~29 million people vaccinated in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. An increased risk of thrombocytopenia after the AstraZeneca vaccine and increased risk of VTE and CVST were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The features in these cases share similarities with heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT). In HITT, platelet-activating antibodies develop after exposure to heparin, which leads to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In VITT, it is suspected that cationic PF4 becomes bound with an anionic molecule produced by the cells at the vaccination site or in the vaccine, which then induces antibody formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These antibodies then bind to platelets via the Fc gamma RIIA receptors which leads to platelet activation, as in HITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】The thrombosis progresses rapidly and has a high disposition at unusual sites, including CVST or the hepatic or portal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In previous cases, patients had also presented with DVT, arterial thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】In previous reports of VITT, few patients had a history of thromboembolic events as seen in our case where the patient had no risk factors for VTE and had a low-risk status. Importantly, almost all patients had significant levels of PF4 antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically, the main features seen in these patients present 5–30 days after vaccination and include thrombocytopaenia, thrombosis and raised d-dimer levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current diagnostic criteria categorizes patients into unlikely, possible, probable and definite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Anticoagulation is currently the first treatment in probable or definite cases of VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. IVIG is also used as immunosuppression. After administration, platelet counts rise, and markers of hypercoagulability improve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that serial blood samples obtained in VITT patients before and after two/three doses of IVIG have demonstrated reversion to a weaker or negative PF4-enhanced SRA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Observational data support the concept that high-dose IVIG is effective in VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Corticosteroids may be used if IVIG is not available; similar to the management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where corticosteroids are believed to raise the platelet count by decreasing clearance of antibody-coated platelets by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Platelet transfusion was avoided due to the risk of progression of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dose therapy effects in our case was evidenced by improving d-dimer, platelets and fibrinogen.\n\n【38】This case highlights the importance of liaising across specialist centres, which, in our case, advised further imaging to rule out distant thrombosis.\n\n【39】Ultimately, this case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, management and monitoring. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of VITT after vaccination. As patients with CVST and/or thrombosis due to VITT can become acutely unwell despite initially appearing to be stable, close monitoring is essential.\n\n【40】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【41】The authors would like to thank Dr Rebecca Spendiff, Colchester general hospital, for providing imaging.\n\n【42】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【43】None declared.\n\n【44】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【45】There are no sources of funding.\n\n【46】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【47】No approval was required.\n\n【48】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【49】Written consent has been obtained by the patient for this publication.\n\n【50】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【51】Dr Saad (SA) Ahmed—Acute Medicine, Colchester Hospital, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Turner Rd, Colchester CO4 5JL, UK.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Pulmonary amyloidosis is rare and can be classified into three forms according to the anatomic site of involvement: nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, tracheobronchial amyloidosis and diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis. The former two usually represent localized amyloid disease and the latter represents systemic disease. Typically lung parenchymal and tracheobronchial amyloidosis do not present together in localized forms of pulmonary amyloidosis. Here we report a unique case of localized pulmonary immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, manifested as both parenchymal nodules and tracheobronchial amyloid deposition.\n\n【2】pulmonary amyloidosis , pulmonary nodular amyloidosis , tracheobronchial amyloidosis , localized amyloidosis\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Amyloid are insoluble heterogenous proteins predominantly composed of β-sheet structure that characteristically bind to the dye Congo Red and produce an apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. With an estimated incidence of approximately 10 cases per million person-years, systemic amyloidosis are considered rare disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

We report a unique case of localized pulmonary amyloidosis who presented with multiple pulmonary nodules and tracheobronchial amyloid deposition.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】In June 2014, a 53-year-old Caucasian female without significant past medical history presented to an outside pulmonary clinic with 4-month history of dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. She was a life-long non-smoker and worked as a medical transcriptionist. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules. She was placed on prednisone 40 mg daily for presumed sarcoidosis. At three months she reported subjective improvement, however a repeat chest CT confirmed persistence of bilateral lung nodules and circumferential mural thickening and narrowing the central airways . She ultimately underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy of a right upper lobe lung nodule. The pathological examination demonstrated lung parenchyma with features consistent with amyloid deposition. Specimen was sent to Mayo Clinic to perform laser-capture microdissection with liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry for amyloid typing, which identified κ light chain as the amyloidogenic protein. Prednisone was tapered off, and she was referred to our institute for further management.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】(a) Chest CT shows multiple bilateral lung nodules, some with central calcifications (arrowhead) and variable-sized cysts  in all lung lobes. Note, airway involvement with circumferential mural thickening of the right lower lobe (RLL) bronchi  and narrowing of right middle lobe (RML) bronchi . (b) Chest CT angiography shows diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage (in the setting of hemoptysis) with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and cysts. Note, presence of endobronchial soft-tissues within RML segmental and subsegmental bronchi .\n\n【10】Her complete blood count, kidney function and calcium level were within normal limit. Serum free light chain assay was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis was positive for M-protein (0.98 mg/dL). Serum immunofixation revealed mildly elevated IgG \\[1620 mg/dL (ref. 717–1411 mg/dL)\\] and κ level \\[1290 mg/dL (ref. 534–1267 mg/dL)\\]. A 24-hour urine protein was normal and no M-protein was identified on urine protein electrophoresis. Troponin and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide were normal. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction with normal diastolic function. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of clonal plasma cells. Given normal serum light chain assay, normal bone marrow biopsy, and lack of systemic involvement, she was diagnosed with localized AL amyloidosis involving the lung. She was also diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) based on positive serum M-protein. No treatment was started, and she was followed with hematology/oncology every 6 months. Of note, bronchoscopy was initially not performed because airway involvement was not reported on the initial CT and the patient was largely asymptomatic when the follow-up chest CT reported evident airway involvement.\n\n【11】Four years later, she developed an episode of hemoptysis. Chest CT angiography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities most suggestive of hemorrhage with persistence of multiple bilateral lung nodules and airway involvement . She underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed multiple yellowish plaques in the mucosal areas involving the subglottic space, trachea, segmental and subsegmental bronchi and a number of infiltrative nodules . Endobronchial biopsies were performed. Pathology of fragments of bronchial mucosa showed extensive amyloid deposits on Congo red stain, consistent with endobronchial amyloidosis . She was treated with bronchoscopic therapy twice at 3 months interval using argon plasma coagulation with resolution of symptoms.\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy shows multiple yellowish plaques  and raised nodular infiltration  of airway mucosa in (a) right upper lobe (b) right middle lobe.\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Photomicrographs of the endobronchial biopsy (a) deposits of amorphous, eosinophilic, waxy-like material (A) with ossification (B), underlying the bronchial epithelium (arrow), H&E, 10x.

She was incidentally noted to have an enlarged right submandibular salivary gland on CT imaging and underwent biopsy in December 2016, which revealed AL (κ) amyloid deposition. By the time this manuscript was being prepared, she remained asymptomatic. She has had stable MGUS with faint serum M protein (0.99 mg/dL) and mildly elevated serum free κ light chain \\[25.5 mg/L (ref. 3.3–19.4 mg/L)\\] on the most recent follow-up studies.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Pulmonary amyloidosis can be localized or part of systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Based on the anatomic site of involvement, pulmonary amyloidosis can be classified into 3 forms: nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, tracheobronchial amyloidosis and diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The former two are usually seen in localized pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nodular amyloidosis is slightly more prevalent than tracheobronchial amyloidosis. In a cases series of 55 patients with pulmonary amyloidosis reported by Mayo Clinic from 1980 to 1993, 11 patients had localized pulmonary amyloidosis. Among them, 7 patients had nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, and 4 patients had tracheobronchial amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Both lung parenchymal and tracheobronchial amyloidosis can be seen in systemic amyloidosis, but rarely present together in localized forms of pulmonary amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In an autopsy study of 11 patients who had lung involvement of systemic amyloidosis, amyloid deposition was found in both alveolar and tracheobronchial mucosa in all 7 patients in whom both alveolar and tracheobronchial histologic examination were available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Only 1 case reported a large solitary pulmonary amyloid tumor protruding into the bronchus lumen, however it did not mention if that patient had systemic or localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, although amyloid deposition was noted in the parotid gland, there was no evidence of other systemic involvement, thus the patient was thought to have localized amyloidosis.\n\n【21】Localized AL amyloidosis generally has an excellent long-term prognosis and rarely evolves into systemic amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In a study of 606 patients with localized amyloidosis (defined as amyloid deposition at one non-vital organ site and with no evidence of systemic organ involvement such as heart, kidney, liver, nerve or tongue), including 35 cases (6%) with tracheobronchial amyloidosis and 47 cases (8%) of nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, only 7 patients (1%) progressed to systemic amyloidosis at a median follow-up of 74 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with isolated lymph node amyloidosis and excess of free light chains are at increased risk of progression to systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The estimated 5-year overall survival was 90% and 10-year overall survival was 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In summary, our case demonstrated that combined pulmonary nodular and tracheobronchial amyloid deposition can be seen in localized pulmonary amyloidosis; presence of one doesn’t rule out the other.\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【24】None declared.\n\n【25】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【26】No source of funding for this report.\n\n【27】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【28】Ethical approval is waived for this study.\n\n【29】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【30】Patient’s written consent has been obtained.\n\n【31】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【32】Atul C.

Her first pregnancy was complicated with obstetric hemorrhage requiring hemotransfusion but delivered a healthy baby girl of 2900 grams. During her third trimester of her second pregnancy, she began with edema and varicose veins on left thigh. At 40 weeks, she developed obstetric pain and inability to ambulate. Physical examination showed prominent hypertrophy and multiple dilated varicose veins in the left limb and port wine nevus . Pregnancy culminated in a transvaginal delivery of a healthy male of 2940 grams. She had 400 mL bleeding during the obstetric event requiring vaginal packing gauze due to superficial mucosal bleeding. Her clinical course was uneventful. Unfortunately, venous doppler ultrasonography was not available to us at the time, and therefore pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was used empirically, after weighing the risk of increased bleeding and the risk of VTE. Nadroparin (3800 IU anti Xa) were started 12 hours post-partum and continued 10 days postdischarge. Subsequent outpatient follow-up showed improvement of her left low er extremity edema, and no new symptomatology was reported.\n\n【2】**Figure 1**\n\n【3】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【4】Prominent hypertrophy, dilated varicose veins and port wine nevus in the left limb.\n\n【5】KTS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a triad of cutaneous hemangioma (port-wine stain), varicose veins and bone or soft tissue hypertrophy affecting one or more limbs.

RR-TB is TB caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ strains that are resistant to rifampicin, whereas MDR TB is defined as TB with _in vitro_ resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin and XDR-TB are strains that fulfill the definition of MDR/RR TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinoles (Moxifloxacillin/Levofloxacillin) and at least one additional group A drugs i.e. Bedaquiline or Linezolid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Previously, management of DR-TB has been a problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> but now with the coming of new and repurposed drugs, there is an improvement in the DR TB treatment outcomes and linezolid is among the best drug when added to Multi drug regimen and Extensive drug regimen with Bedaquiline and Pretomanid (BPaL). Linezolid is an antibiotic in the group of Oxazolidinones that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The toxicity profile of linezolid—which includes partially reversible myelosuppression, optic neuritis, neuropathy and lactic acidosis—limits its use. Studies have shown that treatment limiting toxicity can occur in as many as 11% of persons who receive treatment with linezolid. Adverse events mostly occur when linezolid is given at doses of >600 mg a day, but they can usually be identified early with routine monitoring and are often reversible upon discontinuation of the drug or lowering of the dose. Pyridoxine could be used when linezolid is administered to minimize side effects. Knowledge about the safety of linezolid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited so caution is advised and it is not clearly on the duration for side effects to appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【4】An 81-year-old HIV-negative Malawian man was diagnosed with Rifampicin resistance (RR) TB through Xpert MTB/Rif and was confirmed Multi Drug resistance (MDR) tuberculosis with culture and drug susceptibility testing which was done at National Reference Laboratory. He had no TB history even in his family, but there was history of working in mines in South Africa around 1970s. Contact investigation was done to his four household and close contacts and all were screened negative. Baseline investigations revealed hemoglobin of 12.4, platelets of 147, ALT of 6.8 and AST of 16.68 and chest X-ray with cavities on both lungs . He had no comorbid condition and was not taking any other medicines. With the baseline assessment results, he was put on Longer Regimen All Oral comprised of Bedaquiline 400 mg for 2 weeks then 200 mg for 22 weeks making a total of 6 months, Linezolid 600 mg once a day, Clofazimine 100 mg once a day, Cycloserine 750 mg once a day, Levofloxacillin 1000 mg once a day and Pyridoxine 150 mg once a day. He was receiving this medication as an outpatient but under DOT by a trained nurse and a volunteer and was scheduled to be attending monthly clinical monitoring and follow-up review.\n\n【5】Figure 1\n\n【6】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【7】A chest X-ray which was taken before starting treatment with cavities more prominent to the left than right lung.\n\n【8】At Week 8 while at home, he started vomiting fresh blood and was taken for admission at Karonga district hospital for intensive care and Rockall score was used to determine the severity of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) bleeding although endoscopy was not done due to machine failure (Rockall score of 5). Upon assessment, there was no pertinent risk factor of upper GIT bleeding i.e. no history of smoking, alcohol intake, use of NSAIDs, anticoagulation, and there was no chronic liver disease and peptic ulcer disease. On examination, he had a low BP (85/50 mmHg), PR 118 b/min, RR 20 b/min, temperature of 36°C and the rest of the physical examination was normal. Whole blood count was done, hemoglobin of 4.7 from 12.4 and platelet count was 79 from 147 at baseline, respectively. He was transfused with four units of whole blood in total and linezolid was stopped immediately. All other medicines remained the same with no dose modification and the bleeding stopped spontaneously after 2 days while on treatment. He was diagnosed with an adverse event that was graded to 4 with as life-threatening. An adverse drug reaction report was filled and sent for pharmacovigilance at Malawi Pharmacy and Medicine Regulatory Authority. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of vomiting blood like esophageal varices, esophageal tear, perforated peptic ulcer disease or esophagitis. There was nothing abnormal detected on ultra sound scan on the abdomen. He stayed in the ward for a week and then later was discharged with hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl and platelet count of 145. He was to continue with monthly follow-up , and iron tablets were supplied for a month. The patient culture converted to negative at Month 2 and he remained culture negative up until 18 months when he was finishing treatment. Linezolid was not re-introduced and there was no further episode of vomiting blood and patient was declared cured.\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】A table of baseline and monthly follow-up results.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Linezolid is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic; however, severe adverse effects including myelosuppression, optic neuritis, peripheral neuritis, lactic acidosis are common. Of note, it is the only medicine in Group A that has myelosuppression as one of the adverse event, whereas others in the same group like Bedaquiline, levofloxacin and Clofazimine mainly causesQT prolongation, headache, skin hyperpigmentation and hepatotoxicity. Some studies have reported that the rate of adverse events due to linezolid was high and the most adverse event reported frequently were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea), peripheral neuritis and optic neuritis and that the rate of myelosuppression including anemia and neutropenia was 32.9% higher and the presence of myelosuppression in the group with an initial dose of linezolid >600 mg per day was higher than that in the groups with an initial dose of linezolid less than or equal to 600 mg per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Linezolid toxicity is due to structural homology between target 23 s rRNA in _M. tuberculosis_ and 16 s rRNA in human mitochondria resulting in a narrow therapeutic index and uncertainty around dose optimization. It is reported in one of the study that 38 XDR TB who treated with linezolid demonstrated the inverse association between linezolid trough concentrations associated with lower mitochondrial function and commented that long-term use of linezolid is associated with development of the mitochondrial toxicities of peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, which is contrary with this case report as it happened within 8 weeks of starting the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Other studies have reported that linezolid is effective and safe for the elderly with Gram-positive bacterial infection, but platelet count should be well monitored and that HIV may be a risk factor of linezolid-associated adverse events which in this case is HIV negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is also reported that there is limitation on evaluation of the efficacy and safety of linezolid as efficacy in clinical practice is likely higher due to the additive or synergistic effect when used as combination with other drugs and that linezolid profile is not yet completely known and therefore need quality clinical research to better understand the appropriate dosage that clinicians can prescribe to minimize the probability of events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】Much as linezolid is given and presumed safe in patients on second-line anti-TB, knowledge about the safety of linezolid associated with hematemesis is limited. Published adverse event reports lack adequate information regarding hematemesis after initiation of linezolid. In our case, the relationship between linezolid and the onset of hematemesis is plausible. Health workers should be alert to the possibility of such adverse reaction.\n\n【18】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【19】No conflict of interest.\n\n【20】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【21】Malawi National TB/leprosy elimination program will support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Severe dermatological adverse events are rare with these agents; however, they require direct recognition and management in order not to become life-threatening. Erythema multiforme (EM) belongs to a dermatopathic spectrum that includes immune-mediated, widespread hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs with varying degrees of severity and affects the skin and/or the mucosa.

We also aim to emphasize the breadth of mechanisms of actions of CKIs, with an impingement in the immune system as well, and the importance of promptly identifying and handling such skin toxicities.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Erythema multiforme (EM) comprises an acute, immune-mediated, self-limited and sometimes recurring condition, which is considered a type IV hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections, medications and other various triggers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It affects the skin and/or mucous membranes, depending on its extent (minor or major), and its classic lesion is called ‘target or iris lesion’. Its lesions are typically initiated from the extremities with a predilection for the extensor surfaces, and they spread centripetally, even though patients’ trunk is usually less affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 interacting with cyclin D pose an essential role in cell division and proliferation, inducing the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Thus, CDK4/6 inhibitors (CKIs) block cell cycle progression. CKIs, including palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, are amongst the newest targeted therapies approved for locally advanced or metastatic ﻿hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer (BC). Their most common adverse events (AEs) are haematologic and gastrointestinal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cutaneous toxicities have been reported to an ~15% of total AEs with CKIs and are mostly grade 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We hereby describe the case of a female patient who developed grade 2 EM while treated with ribociclib and later on with palbociclib.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 50-year-old premenopausal female was diagnosed with HR-positive and HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. She underwent a right mastectomy and axillary lymph node (LN) dissection, where 2 out of the 10 removed LNs were infiltrated. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy followed for 5 years, with tamoxifen and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue.\n\n【7】Fourteen years later, the patient complained about swelling in her right arm. On physical examination, swelling and palpable masses in the field of the preceded mastectomy and axilla, with infiltration of the overlying axillary skin, were found. The following imaging showed an 18-mm lesion on the right pectoralis major and the conterminous axilla, without pathological axillary LNs. The core biopsy from the lesion of the right axillary region confirmed the recrudescence of BC. The requested chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed multiple lung nodules (<1 cm). The patient was commenced on letrozole and ribociclib.\n\n【8】Almost 6 weeks later, she complained about a skin rash with a burning and itching sensation in both her upper extremities. On physical examination, erythematous, pink-to-violaceous, tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae were observed on her hands bilaterally . According to the patient, the lesions erupted 1 month after the initiation of the therapy and got worse over the last 2 weeks. The oral cavity was unaffected.\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】First eruption of EM-like skin lesions in palms, after treatment with letrozole and ribociclib.\n\n【12】Regarding her medical history, she suffered from Hashimoto thyroiditis and arterial hypertension. No use of new medications or other substances was reported.\n\n【13】The lesions had the typical appearance of EM. However, at this first evaluation, skin biopsies were not obtained. Given the suspicion of ribociclib-mediated skin toxicity, the permanent discontinuation of ribociclib was decided. The patient continued receiving letrozole, and the rash gradually abated. A month later, the CKI palbociclib was added to the treatment.\n\n【14】After the first cycle of palbociclib, the patient presented grade 3 neutropenia and recurrence of the skin rash. Again, she had tender, annular papules with dusky centres and bullae with the ‘bull’s eye’ appearance. A complete physical examination revealed an aphthous lesion in the hard palate. The skin punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion on the fourth finger due to its typical ‘bull’s eye’ appearance, adequate size and easy access. It showed epidermal and subepidermal vesiculation, apoptotic keratinocytes in all levels of the epidermis and moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltration associated with lymphocytic exocytosis and satellite cell necrosis as well as extravasation of red blood cells in the upper dermis . Melanin incontinence or neutrophils were not found in the infiltrate. These features confirmed the drug-mediated lichenoid skin reaction with characteristics of EM. The definite discontinuation of the CKIs was decided, and the patient was continued on letrozole. All lesions subsided within the next month. She remains in remission from BC (progression-free survival of 2 years) and without EM recurrence.\n\n【15】Figure 2\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】( **A** ) skin punch biopsy form the hand showing lichenoid infiltrate rich in lymphocytes in the upper dermis, epidermal and focal sub-epidermal vesiculation.

Magnification: (A) ×40, (B) ×100.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】The pathobiology of EM relies on the immune-mediated response to an inciting event. Infections constitute the trigger in ~90% of cases, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) being the most common precipitator factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In contrast to viral-associated EM, where the effector cytokine is interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, cases of drug-induced EM are associated with tumour necrosis factor-a, perforin and granzyme B, which cause the epidermal destruction seen in the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In cases of drug-induced EM, lesions appear within 72 hours of drug exposure but occasionally erupt over 1–2 weeks. Duration from onset to healing, typically without complications, is <4 weeks, usually about 2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of EM is predominantly clinical, based on the patient’s history and physical examination. When the clinical picture is clear, a biopsy is not required because its findings are not specific to EM. In atypical presentation or recurrent EM without documented HSV infection, histopathological features may pose the main role in the differential diagnosis of EM from other entities that mimic its onset, such as urticaria, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> The treatment of EM depends on the underlying aetiology and the disease severity. The main aim is to remove the impelling factor. In the case of a drug-induced EM, this entails the discontinuation of the responsible medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The mechanism of action of CKIs is manifold. Apart from obstructing cell cycle proliferation, they are capable of upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I and enhancing antigen presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Moreover, they increase proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, programmed death-ligand 1 expression and infiltration of the effector T cells in the tumour microenvironment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Last but not least, CKIs selectively deplete the T-regulatory population by suppressing their proliferation, decreasing their effect in subduing immune response simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】CKIs are generally considered safe, with manageable side effects. The most frequently reported amongst them include haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, especially neutropenia with palbociclib and ribociclib and diarrhoea with abemaciclib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Skin reactions are also included in the spectrum of their AEs, yet they are usually considered mild and do not warrant a definite cessation of them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, more severe skin toxicities, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Herein, we have presented a case of CKI-induced EM. In our case, EM erupted later than typically reported after drug exposure and occurred while on treatment both with ribociclib and palbociclib; thus, EM constituted a drug class-observed AE. We would like to emphasize that a multidisciplinary approach to oncological patients, as well as early recognition and sufficient management of skin toxicities, are mandatory in order to prevent lethal conditions and improve the quality of life of this population.\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【24】E.V.

Its symptoms usually do not appear until adulthood. We report a patient who was admitted with recurrent pneumothorax. Discovering typical cutaneous lesions accompanied with a history of the same condition in his son, BHD syndrome was diagnosed.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease that is manifested by benign cutaneous tumors (fibrofolliculoma and trichodiscoma), recurrent pneumothorax, multiple lung cysts and renal cancer. This syndrome, which was first described in 1977, is caused by a mutation in the folliculin gene (FLCN) located on chromosome 17 通用删除11(英):<u>(p11.2)</u>, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein folliculin. Dysfunction of the folliculin protein leads to the abnormalities seen in BHD syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】The patient was a nonsmoker 70-year-old man who presented with pain in the right side of his chest, shortness of breath and tachypnea that started suddenly after he lifted a heavy object. The patient also reported an occasional dry cough. He mentioned the history of similar symptoms and associated pneumothorax twice, once in the same year and once 6 years before. Both of the episodes also occurred in the right lung, causing him to be hospitalized with a chest tube. Vital signs on arrival were oxygen saturation of 90%, blood pressure of 130/80, respiratory rate of 23 per minute and pulse rate of 98 beats per min. Several 1–2 mm soft and whitish lesions were found at the site of hair growth in the form of dome-shaped papules, the same color as the skin. Furthermore, small lesions and peduncles were observed on the right shoulder, neck and upper chest .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Patient’s skin lesions. (A) fibrofolliculoma and trichodiscom (yellow arrow) (B) Acrochordon .\n\n【9】Chest wall examination showed hyper-resonance and reduced breath sound in the right lung, and asymmetric chest expansion. A family history of multiple pneumothorax incidents were reported in his 30-year-old son. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive pneumothorax in the right side of the chest and multiple parenchymal cysts. Moreover, sub-pleural fibrotic bands were detected at the lower lobes of both lungs . There were no abnormal findings in the renal, liver and hematology laboratory tests. A chest tube was placed in the right side of pleural space, and the patient’s symptoms improved afterward. Renal ultrasonography was performed, and the result was unremarkable. His chest tube was removed after 3 days, and he was discharged with a good general condition.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Patients chest CT scan: (A) right side pneumothorax. (B, C) multiple parenchymal cysts (blue arrow) and, sub-pleural fibrosis at the inferior lobes of both lungs (yellow arrow).\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Spontaneous pneumothorax may be primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without an external predisposing factor and/or pulmonary disease However, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax happens due to serious underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic diseases of the lung such as BHD syndromes and Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) and other diseases such as thoracic endometriosis. BHD is caused by a mutation in the FCLN gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein folliculin. Abnormal folliculin protein accounts for the manifestations of BHD. The incidence of BHD syndrome is unknown worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The main and most common cutaneous lesion of BHD syndrome is a benign hair follicle hamartoma called fibrofolliculoma. These lesions usually occur as numerous small whitish lesions on the face and neck of patients. Another cutaneous lesion is called trichodiscoma, which is similar in appearance. Another cutaneous lesion is Acrochordon—a small and pedunculated lesion with a dermal and epidermal origin. Acrochordon usually appears on the eyelid, neck, upper chest and armpits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition to cutaneous lesions, patients with BHD syndrome have bilateral, multiple, small and irregular-shaped cysts in the peripheral lung parenchyma. Unlike bullae in emphysema, which are usually found in the apices of the lungs, BHD cysts are more common in the bases. These cysts’ walls are covered with a layer of the alveolar epithelium, which is unique and puts patients at increased risk for recurrent pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】These cysts grow gradually and are hamartomatous, and in all cases, the cyst wall staining is positive for FLCN. The most worrying feature of BHD syndrome is its association with renal lesions, especially renal cancers. The prevalence of renal tumors in people with this syndrome is seven times higher. The most common renal cancer histopathologies are chromophobe and chromophobe-oncocytic, but papillary and clear cell types are also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. LAM is most often seen in young women with small thin-walled cysts that spread throughout the parenchyma of both lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare nodular and cystic disease of the lung interstitium that primarily affects young adult smokers. It is caused by aggregations of abnormal dendritic cells. Chest CT scan shows thickening of the interstitial tissue, as well as multiple cysts and nodules, usually in the upper lobes, sometimes leading to pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Another disease with similar lung involvement to BHD is pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, a life-threatening disease, which is observed in individuals with immunodeficiency. These patients are often referred to the hospital due to pulmonary insufficiency, fever and dry cough. Chest radiography of these patients shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrations, single or multiple nodules and sometimes pneumatocele and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs in patients with COPD. Bullae formation is associated with non-fibrotic degradation of the airways, and usually affects the upper lobes more than the lower lobes. These patients often have a history of smoking and coughing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Our case was a 70-year-old man who was referred to the hospital with recurrent pneumothorax. Male sex, absence of immunodeficiency and smoking history, his imaging and cutaneous findings, as well as a family history of pneumothorax in his son are all highly suggestive of BHD disease. Considering the rarity, diagnosis of the disease and its complications is often delayed. Therefore, after diagnosis, annual medical follow-up with laboratory tests and imaging is recommended. For those patients with recurrent pneumothorax wedge resection or pleurodesis are beneficial. Moreover, the genetic evaluation of other family members is necessary for early diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In this case, BHD diagnosis was made due to recurrent pneumothorax, cutaneous lesions and imaging findings. Early diagnosis of these patients is valuable to alert providers to the need for annual renal cancer screening and to suggest possible treatment options. Determination of pneumothorax etiology is important in order to treat the patients appropriately.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【21】Not applicable.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【23】No conflict of interest.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】This article was prepared without any support or funding.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】This report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ardabil University of Medical Science.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】Dr. Mohammad Negaresh.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Primary CD20 negative DLBCL is not common and has comparably bad prognosis as CD-20 negative DLBCL is refractory to standard treatment and this subtype is usually associated with extra nodal disease, unusual morphology and aggressive behavior. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We report a case of _de novo_ CD20 negative DLBCL that did not respond to first-line treatment and required salvage chemotherapy to achieve partial remission.\n\n【4】CASE\n----\n\n【5】A 33-year-old male with no known comorbid presented with complaints of neck swelling which progressively increased in size for 3 months, associated with fever and difficulty in breathing. On examination he was vitally stable. General physical examination showed multiple skin lesions and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy with the left cervical node measuring 4 × 6 cm in size. Systemic examination was unremarkable. His computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed large infiltrative heterogeneously enhancing mass involving superior anterior and middle mediastinum involving root of aorta and other major vessels with extension of disease encasing trachea, superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, pulmonary trunk and veins . Punch biopsy of the skin was done which showed mild irregular acanthosis and focal parakeratosis representing inflammatory hyperpigmentation which was managed with skin moisturizers. Excisional lymph node biopsy from left cervical area was sent for AFB smear culture, Gene-Xpert for tuberculosis (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) and bacterial culture which were negative. Histopathology showed effaced architecture and infiltration with atypical lymphoid cells showing pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was positive, while it was negative for CD-20 but positive for CD79a, PAX-5 which are other B cell markers .\n\n【6】Considering diagnosis of CD20 negative DLBCL further work up including CD138 for possible plasmablastic variant, ALK protein, EBV, CD30 and HHV 8 was performed for other differential diagnosis, which were negative . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was also negative. Considering the diagnosis of primary CD20 negative DLBCL, which is a high-grade lymphoma, we started him on infusion chemotherapy regimen i.e. EPOCH (Etoposide, Prednisolone, Doxorubicin, vincristine along with bolus of cyclophosphamide). His follow-up interim scan done after four cycles of EPOCH did not show any change in the disease status (treatment failure). Subsequently he was started on second-line chemotherapy i.e. GCD (Gemcitabine, Cisplatin and Dexamethasone) and after two cycles his interim PET-CT scan showed partial remission. We are now planning for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) once he achieved response on two more cycles of GCD.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】CT chest with contrast showing large heterogeneous mass.\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】(A), (B) and (C) showing Lymph node biopsy HE at 20-X and 40-X show effaced architecture by group of atypical lymphocytes.

They constitute 1–3% of all B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. CD20 is a pan B-cell marker and cells can still survive even after loss of CD20 expression in CD20 negative DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Known subtypes include plasmablastic lymphomas (PBL), primary effusion lymphomas (PEL), anaplastic kinase positive large B-cell lymphomas (ALK+ve LBCL) and large B-cell lymphomas arising in human herpes virus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8 MCD-LBCL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The most prevalent and well-known sub-type is PBL, which accounts for 75% of the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both HIV-positive and -negative patients have been found to have primary CD20 loss in DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pathologically, CD20 negative DLBCL is more closely associated with aggressive pathologic parameters with a high proliferation index and a higher proportion of non-GCB type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only a few cases of well-established sub-types of CD-20 negative DLBCL have been reported that could not be categorized as known variants of CD20 negative DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This might broaden the spectrum of unclassifiable primary CD20 negative DLBCL which shows genetic and immunophenotypic aberrancy and results in diagnostic and therapeutic challenges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Morphology and the results of immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry are used to identify DLBCL. Positivity of CD19, CD79, PAX5 are the major immunohistochemical biomarkers used to establish a diagnosis of CD20 negative B cell lymphomas, while flowcytometric analysis shows positivity for CD19, CD79a, CD5 and CD10 in cases of CD20 negative B cell lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

Considering poor prognosis, high-dose chemotherapy had been suggested i.e. either cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate (hyperCVAD), EPOCH with modified dose, or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide and cytarabine (CODOX M/IVAC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u> as per previous literature review.\n\n【17】Our patient did not respond to EPOCH chemotherapy regimen.

FBs generally do not cause complications and pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Less than 0.0005% of them get trapped in the appendix and require surgical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】In the asymptomatic patient, a series of abdominal X-ray is recommended following up on the progress of the foreign body. When a foreign body becomes immobile at a distal bowel, a high suspicion of a foreign body trapped in the appendix must be considered, and a prophylactic appendectomy is recommended with or without a sign of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【8】A 13-year-old Syrian female was presented to the emergency department for evaluation after accidentally swallowing a foreign body (a pin). In her medical history, the girl was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 8 years before by MEFV mutation. The patient’s symptoms were controlled by colchicine (0.07 mg/kg/day) with the last attack a year ago. Upon physical examination, the patient was alert, without distress, and all her vital signs were within the normal average. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-distended, non-tender abdomen. The abdominal radiography showed a radiopaque foreign body in the right lower quadrant . As the physical exam was normal and the foreign body was not causing obstruction, it was predicted that it will pass through spontaneously without any complications and the patient was discharged with instructions for getting abdominal X-rays as an outer patient for follow-up. A week later the patient had episodes of colicky abdominal pain around the umbilicus without any other symptoms. There were not any remarkable signs in the abdominal examination except for a mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There was no palpable mass, and the bowel sounds were normal.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant.\n\n【12】**Figure 2**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Highly echogenic, linear metallic foreign body.\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】(a) An appendix with trapped pin. (b) The trapped pin.\n\n【18】Laboratory investigations were within the normal range. The white blood cell count was 8500 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> , differential count polymorphs 45%, lymphocytes 50% and platelets (PLT) 450 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen were normal. Abdominal X-ray showed a foreign body in the right lower quadrant, which was in the same location that the prior abdominal radiography showed. An abdominal ultrasound scan was requested which revealed highly echogenic, the linear metallic foreign body within a slightly swollen appendix .\n\n【19】Because the pin was trapped in the appendix with difficultly to pass through and to avoid further complications such as inflammation or perforation, the patient was taken up for surgery. During surgery a sharp pin was found to be trapped in the appendix with no signs of inflammation or perforation. The procedure completed as prophylactic appendectomy .\n\n【20】The patient was discharged the next day after surgery, with no postoperative complications.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】Most of the FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously within a week and do not cause any complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In rare cases, the foreign body tends to be trapped in the appendix which is attributable to an inferior anatomical location, angulation or narrowing and remains stagnant as a result of the inability to return it to a normal pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Rare cases in which a foreign body in the appendix has not generated inflammation have been described in the literature. The first reported appendectomy was in 1735 by Amyand, a London surgeon who removed an appendix perforated by a pin from an 11-year-old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. More than 250 cases of appendiceal foreign bodies have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Clinical signs of FBs depend on their size, shape and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Some cases may be asymptomatic, while others if the object is thin, sharp or metallic up to 93% of the patients may experience symptoms like abdominal pain and low-grade fever, with or without vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In the asymptomatic patient, a serial of abdominal X-ray is recommended following up on the progress of the foreign body. When the foreign body remains in the right lower quadrant in serial abdominal X-ray, an appendicular foreign body should be highly suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Although FBs in the appendix are rare, different kinds of foreign bodies have been reported to be trapped in the appendix, and most of them are found to be radiopaque.\n\n【27】An appendicular foreign body can be classified into high-risk and low-risk depending on the ingested object. High-risk FBs are found in 75% of the cases and include sharp, long or pointed, while low-risk are found in 12% of the cases and include blunt, round objects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. The appendicular foreign body carries a risk of developing appendicitis, peritonitis, perforation, hemorrhage or an abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Due to this, an appendectomy is performed with or without any sign of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our case, the patient had a history and diagnosis of FMF. She came with episodes of colicky abdominal pain without any clinical or laboratory signs of FMF attack. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound appeared linear metallic foreign body trapped in the appendix. The determination of surgical intervention was based on ultrasound, which revealed the foreign body in the lumen of the appendix regardless of physical examination to avoid complications in the upcoming future, and a prophylactic appendectomy was done.\n\n【29】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【30】We wish to thank the medical officer and doctors in pediatric and pediatric surgery departments for the consent for publication and the laboratory assistants in Tishreen Hospital Laboratory.\n\n【31】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【32】None declared.\n\n【33】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【34】No funding was obtained for this study.\n\n【35】ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n------------------------------------------\n\n【36】This case report did not require review by the ethics committee of Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.\n\n【37】WRITTEN INFORMED\n----------------\n\n【38】Consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

On the 30th day, we added intravenous cyclophosphamide administration. On the 31st day, she suddenly developed severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). She was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and ganciclovir administration was initiated. On her 12th day in the ICU, she was extubated and underwent a minitracheostomy as she still had a poor cough reflex. The minitracheostomy was safely constructed by adequately trained anesthesiologists and a surgeon using a video bronchoscope. On the 16th day, the minitracheostomy tube was removed after the improvement in tracheal clearance, and she returned to the normal ward. That night, she suddenly exclaimed in delirium. Physical examination revealed palpable crepitus in the chest. Computed tomography showed a remarkable pneumomediastinum .

Although imaging may be helpful for diagnosis, fistulae are often difficult to identify. An 81-year-old woman presented with mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral pneumonia and hepatic cyst infection with air-fluid levels. After mechanical ventilation, abdominal CT showed increased air in the hepatic cyst. The drainage bag for the hepatic cyst infection was also inflated by positive pressure ventilation, suggesting a possible HBF. The ventilator was adjusted to minimize pressure on the fistula and prevent retrograde infection. The fistula eventually closed spontaneously.

HBF should be suspected when positive pressure ventilation results in increased air at the hepatic infection site.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A hepatobronchial fistula (HBF) is a rare complication of several hepatic diseases; no previous case reports have described HBF associated with hepatic cyst infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An HBF is diagnosed by imaging and identification of clinical symptoms such as abdominal infection and respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; it is important to minimize pressure on the fistula through drainage or other means 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the case of ventilator management, positive pressure ventilation is required, making management even more difficult. We report the first case of hepatic cyst infection complicated by an HBF, diagnosed based on both characteristic computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings. Appropriate ventilator settings, as well as drainage management, eventually resulted in fistula closure.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 81-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of mild fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, that had lasted for one and a half months. She has been diagnosed with an asymptomatic hepatic cyst previously . On examination, her body temperature was 36.1°C, blood pressure 116/77 mmHg, pulse 100/min and respiratory rate 25/min, with an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 86% on reserved mask at 10 L/min. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, and the abdomen was slightly distended. Laboratory examination results were as follows: white blood cell count, 16 100/μl; C-reactive protein, 14.52 mg/dl; AST, 24 U/L; ALT, 12 U/L; ALP, 465 U/L; γ-GTP, 91 U/L; T-Bil, 1.2 mg/dl and D-Bil, 0.4 mg/dl. Chest and abdominal CT showed bilateral consolidation in the lungs and a large cystic lesion with air in the right hepatic lobe .\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Abdominal CT 5 years prior to admission showing a cyst in the right hepatic lobe.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Abdominal and chest CT at admission showing a cyst containing air-fluid levels in the right hepatic lobe measuring 106 mm × 103 mm, and bilateral consolidation in the lungs.\n\n【12】She was intubated and treated with positive pressure ventilation, vasopressors and antibiotics (tazobactam/piperacillin and clindamycin). The PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio after intubation was 142 (positive end-expiratory pressure 7 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O), and the patient was considered to have moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Contrast-enhanced CT (8 h after the first) showed an increase in air in the hepatic cyst  and a potential connection between the hepatic infection site and peripheral bronchus . We performed percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage (PTAD) and obtained 400 ml of creamy pus, and observed no leakage of contrast agent into the thoracic cavity . In addition to CT findings, the drainage bag was inflated by positive pressure ventilation; this led us to believe that the patient had an HBF. The ventilation settings were adjusted to apply minimal pressure in order to prevent the drainage bag from inflating, while preventing retrograde infection with positive pressure ventilation.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】( **A** ) Abdominal enhanced CT reveals a rapid increase of air within the hepatic cyst; ( **B** ) Abdominal enhanced CT showing disruption of the continuity of the wall of the hepatic cyst; the fluid component is continuing to the pleural cavity (red arrow).\n\n【16】**Figure 4**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】PTAD does not show any contrast agent leakage into the chest cavity.\n\n【19】Cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were positive for _Escherichia coli_ ; this also supported the diagnosis of a HBF. We changed the antibiotics to cefazolin and metronidazole on Day 4; the fistula was considered to be clinically closed on Day 5, as the drainage bag was no longer inflated. Blood and sputum cultures were negative on Day 9. CT showed a reduction in the size of the hepatic lesion , and her respiratory condition gradually improved. However, CT on Day 12  revealed mediastinal emphysema. Due to concerns regarding the possibility of exacerbation of the mediastinal emphysema with positive pressure ventilation and improvement of the PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio, she was extubated on Day 13. However, her respiratory condition worsened, and she was unable to withstand further invasive procedures. After discussion with her family, we halted invasive treatment on Day 16, and she died on Day 18.\n\n【20】**Figure 5**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Abdominal CT shows a reduction in the size of the hepatic cyst infection.\n\n【23】**Figure 6**\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Chest CT showing mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema.\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【27】Hepatic cysts are asymptomatic and typically require no treatment. However, treatment is necessary when complications occur. Treatment strategies for infection include antibiotics, percutaneous drainage and surgical interventions. Initial independent antibiotic therapy fails in 70% of cases, eventually requiring percutaneous drainage or surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The mortality rate is relatively low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>; however, complications due to HBF led to poor outcomes in our case. This case shows that patients with hepatic cysts are at risk of developing HBF due to infection.\n\n【28】There are five categories of HBF: congenital, hepatic hydatid disease or liver abscess, biliary tract obstruction secondary to tumors, injury and iatrogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Few cases are caused by infection, which accounts for 10% or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A search of literature does not reveal any cases of hepatic cyst infection leading to HBF, although there are several case reports on HBF due to liver abscess, unrelated to hepatic cyst infection.\n\n【29】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are useful for the detection of fistulae. CT and magnetic resonance imaging are also useful diagnostic tools, although they can fail to detect the fistulous tract itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, we suspected HBF based on CT findings. A definite diagnosis was made based on the fact that the drainage bag inflated due to positive airway pressure, and the cultures of sputum and pus from the hepatic cyst were the same, although PTAD did not reveal the fistula. There are no case reports on drainage bag expansion due to positive pressure ventilation; this finding will be useful for future practice.\n\n【30】There is currently no standard treatment for HBF. Maintaining low pressure at the opening of the fistula is vital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This can be accomplished by drainage, which may be accomplished by using a chest tube, ERCP, PTC or by surgical excision of the fistula tract. Clinicians prefer less invasive and non-surgical treatment, because the recovery rate is higher than that with traditional surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in refractory cases, traditional surgery is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case, appropriate antibiotic treatment and drainage by PTAD were administered for the infected hepatic cyst; the patient responded well to the therapy. Ventilator settings were adjusted, and the fistula was considered to be clinically closed, because the drainage bag was no longer inflated by positive pressure ventilation. However, the patient had moderate ARDS at the time of initial treatment, and despite guideline-recommended respiratory management, she died due to progressive ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. If the presence of the fistula itself is detrimental to the condition, early surgical intervention may be necessary; however, surgery was not performed in this case owing to the severity of the disease and the vulnerable health of the patient.\n\n【31】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【32】Not applicable.\n\n【33】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【34】None declared.\n\n【35】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【36】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【37】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【38】No ethical approval was required.\n\n【39】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【40】Consent was obtained for publication of the data in this article.\n\n【41】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【42】Hatsuo Isogai.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to DKA is extremely rare; however, cardiogenic shock is a potential complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. We present a rare case describing diabetic ketoacidosis leading to profound acidosis causing stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that is successfully managed with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【3】The patient is a 25-year-old woman with no prior medical problems who felt weakness and lethargy for 2 days. She was found unresponsive and brought to the hospital. Initial physical exam revealed Kussmaul breathing at a rate of 32 respirations/minute, heart rate of 113 beats per minute and blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg. The patient’s extremities were cool and clammy. Initial glucose was incalculably high. She received 3 liters (L) fluid and started on insulin at 6 units per hour. Initial lab work revealed pH < 7.0 and a bicarbonate of 2 meq. Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with borderline prolonged QTc at 501 ms. BNP elevated at 329 on admission. Initial troponin 0.27 ng/mL, peaking at 4.68 ng/mL.\n\n【4】Shortly after her arrival to ICU, she became hypotensive.

Bedside cardiac ultrasound was concerning for an ejection fraction (EF) 20–25% with regional wall motion abnormality, suspicious but typical for stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission confirmed these findings and demonstrated basal and mid anterior wall abnormalities as well as basal and mid-septal abnormalities, consistent with the typical pattern of stress-induced cardiomyopathy .

A left heart catheterisation revealed no coronary artery disease.\n\n【10】Further work to evaluate potential alternative causes of cardiomyopathy included COVID testing that was negative on admission; additionally, COVID antibodies were negative. Viral titers including Epstein–Barr virus, Coxsackie virus, Human Herpes Virus, Parvovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis panel and HIV were essentially unremarkable. Autoimmune cardiomyopathy was considered, and ANA and ANCA were negative. All four criteria for diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy were met based on the mayo clinic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy  revealed no significant inflammation, granulomas, giant cells or fibrosis. Additional staining with Congo Red excluded amyloid deposition. Additionally, iron staining did not reveal any significant hemosiderosis. The only explanation for this patient’s cardiomyopathy is stress-induced cardiomyopathy, secondary to profound acidemia in DKA. The patient’s hospital course was further complicated by the development of polyglandular failure and polyradiculoneuropathy of bilateral lower extremities, confirmed with EMG testing, ultimately consistent with toxic/inflammatory neuropathy secondary to profound shock and metabolic derangements after extensive imaging and lab studies, including MRI, US, were unrevealing for other attributable causes. A diagnosis of type I diabetes mellitus was confirmed with anti-GAD antibodies. It was felt that her polyglandular failure was strongly related to an autoimmune process related to her type-1 diabetes. The patient received five sessions of IVIG.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Endomyocardial biopsy. Hematoxylin and eosin stain.

Her cardiac and renal function eventually fully recovered. Repeat TTE on hospital day 6 demonstrated a recovery of EF to 50% with global hypokinesis . She was transferred out of the cardiac ICU on hospital day 10 and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation unit after a 23-day hospital stay, maintained on daily aspirin, lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Transthoracic echocardiography, hospitalisation day 6.

It has been described more frequently in recent years as a cause of cardiomyopathy, when ischemic cardiomyopathy and all other potential causes are ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is a potentially fatal possible complication of stress-induced cardiomyopathy if it is not recognised and managed appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is described in less than 10% of cases related to stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】We present a rare case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock that was successfully managed by VA-ECMO in a previous healthy 25-year-old female who was diagnosed with severe DKA.\n\n【21】Various endocrine conditions have been described as precipitating stress-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Although diabetes has been described as protective against stress-induced cardiomyopathy, the patient’s profound acidosis was significant enough to overcome any protective benefit and lead to cardiogenic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. All other causes of transient cardiomyopathy were ruled out with extensive work during her admission.\n\n【22】The prompt recognition of cardiogenic shock is vital to ensuring favorable outcomes. In our case, cardiogenic shock was identified within the first few hours of presentation, and prompt management and initiation of VA-ECMO led to the patient’s meaningful recovery.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【24】There are no acknowledgements to declare.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【26】None declared.\n\n【27】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【28】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】No ethical approval is required.\n\n【31】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【32】Patient consent has been obtained.\n\n【33】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【34】Riley Gurreri, DO.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We report a patient who initially responded to Pegylated interferon treatment for HBV-HDV co-infection. Although initial improvement in viraemia from both virsues was seen, SVR was not achieved with ongoing progression of liver injury biochemically.

Therefore, Hepatitis delta infection is either acquired simultaneously with, or as a superinfection to, existing HBV. Transmission routes are the same as for HBV, including percutaneous and sexual contact with blood products that are infected (and rarely vertical transmission from mother to child). Acute simultaneous HDV-HBV co-infection causes a hepatitis ranging in severity from mild to fulminant, however a complete recovery is usually seen, and <5% progress to chronic. In contrast, HDV superinfection on a background of established chronic HBV carries a much poorer prognosis in up to 90% of cases, accelerating the development of cirrhosis by almost a decade compared with chronic HBV alone.\n\n【4】**Figure 1**\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Hepatitis B and D viral loads over time.\n\n【7】HDV-HBV co-infection is seen in at least 5% of chronic HBV cases worldwide resulting in >15–20 million estimated cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, although this is thought to be an underestimation of the true prevalence. However, following a global vaccination programme for HBV, the overall number of HDV cases has decreased over the last four decades.\n\n【8】HDV-HBV co-infection is regarded as the most serious form of chronic viral hepatitis, leading to accelerated liver-related morbidity and mortality including hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HDV infection can be prevented successfully by HBV immunisation, current treatment options for established HDV infections have disappointing success rates.

He did not drink alcohol or have any risk factors for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Subsequent investigations revealed a diagnosis of HBV-HDV co-infection, and histopathology was consistent with advanced fibrosis (Ishak stage 5) with severe portal inflammation. Viral loads of both viruses were detectable with HBV DNA of 39 iU/ml (e-antigen negative/e-antibody positive at presentation) and a rising HDV RNA of 6.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml going up to 8.8 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> iU/ml.\n\n【12】Treatment with Pegylated interferon-alpha 3 was initiated in April 2014, and an initial encouraging response was documented with HDV RNA down to 220 iU/ml after 14 weeks of treatment. After 6 months, HBV DNA was undetectable and after 8 months, HDV RNA was also undetectable. The patient completed 12 months of treatment before unfortunately being lost to follow up and therefore SVR was not assessed.\n\n【13】Two years later, aged 45, he presented to Luton & Dunstable University hospital with a transaminitis (ALT 61). Although the liver looked radiologically unremarkable, a subsequent Fibroscan indicated F2 fibrosis (7.2 kPa). In addition, viral loads of both viruses had become detectable again (HDV RNA 77 iU/ml, HBV DNA 30 iU/ml). The suspicion that both viruses working in tandem were causing progressive liver damage prompted treatment with a second course of Pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (Pegasys).\n\n【14】Following this second course (which the patient stopped at 6 months due to non-compliance) he was essentially cured of his Hepatitis delta infection (HDV RNA undetectable, HDV IgM negative) with an SVR 12 months after completion of treatment . Furthermore, although Hepatitis B surface antigen remains positive and therefore functional cure has not been achieved, he became a very low level chronic HBV carrier (HBV DNA undetectable) as a result of the treatment. Finally, persistent biochemical normalization has been achieved.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】This is an interesting case because although the initial full course of treatment improved viraemia from both viruses, SVR was not achieved with persistent infection re-presenting as a transaminitis with Fibroscan evidence of ongoing fibrosis. Of note, advanced fibrosis was diagnosed histologically just 3 years prior to the Fibroscan which indicated F2 fibrosis in 2017. This may indicate improvement in fibrosis following initial treatment course (taking the differences in diagnostic modality into consideration), or may be as a result of potential overstating of fibrosis histologically (taking into account the significant improvement in fibrosis over only 3 years as indicated by the histology and subsequent Fibroscan). However, the summative effect of the second course, albeit for a subtherapeutic duration, appears to have achieved very low level HBV carrier status (with persistently undetectable viral load) and Hepatitis delta infection cure as well as biochemical normalisation.\n\n【17】A case described in the literature describes how functional cure of chronic HBV (with HBsAg clearance) as well as SVR of HDV infection was achieved after 12 years of treatment with interferon-alpha 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, subsequent literature including a meta-analysis comparing interferon-alpha, lamivudine and pegylated interferon-alpha for the treatment of HBV-HDV co-infection concluded that pegylated interferon-alpha led to superior SVR rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Two subsequent studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u> highlighted that longer courses of Pegylated interferon have superior SVR rates, however treatment is generally poorly tolerated, which is likely to impact compliance with longer courses. Furthermore, there is still a significant proportion of patients who do not achieve SVR after initial response to treatment with Pegylated interferon despite length of treatment as highlighted by these studies.\n\n【18】Although research into a superior therapy for HDV-HBV co-infection is ongoing, the lack of enzymatic proteins to target in the HDV means that conventional antiviral therapy has limited efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This case illustrates the cumulative effect of a ‘double hit’ of Pegylated interferon-alpha treatment as a successful treatment strategy for persistent HBV-HDV co-infection in patients who do not achieve SVR following initial treatment until a superior management option becomes available.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【20】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【21】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【22】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【23】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【24】Ethical approval is not required.\n\n【25】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【26】Written consent obtained.\n\n【27】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【28】Meha Bhuva.\n\n【29】Sambit Sen.\n\n【30】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【31】No acknowledgments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, the procedure is not without risks of severe morbidity. We herein report hemostasis for accidental venous puncture using thoracoscopy. A 44-year-old man with short bowel syndrome and chronic renal failure required central venous catheterization for nutritional management and hemodialysis. Right internal jugular vein puncture was performed under ultrasonographic guidance, and the guidewire was inserted into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. However, the operator inadvertently perforated the vein, and the thoracic cavity was entered while inserting the introducer. The patient’s vital signs were stable; therefore, we performed emergency surgery after computed tomography and achieved hemostasis through thoracoscopic surgery. Sufficient caution should be exercised while inserting central venous catheters through a thrombosed internal jugular vein. In some instances of catheter-induced vessel injury, combined surface and thoracoscopic hemostasis may be a reliable and minimally invasive management option.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Central venous (CV) catheterization is commonly required for patient management. However, therapy can be complicated by morbidities caused by this procedure; these complications can be severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>. Here, we describe a case of an accidental puncture into the thoracic cavity upon insertion of an introducer into the right internal jugular vein (IJV) and the management strategy used to mitigate the damage.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for living-donor kidney transplantation. He had a history of short bowel syndrome due to massive small bowel resection by mesenteric lymphangioma at 3 years of age, and a history of chronic renal disease secondary to renal interstitial disorders associated with short bowel syndrome and chronic dehydration, requiring dialysis since 41 years of age. He received living-donor kidney transplantation; however, he developed acute cellular rejection, and dialysis was required again. Owing to the above condition, the patient has required the installation of multiple venous catheters, with the development of calcifications and thrombi in both brachiocephalic veins and subclavian veins. Computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis of the right IJV ; however, ultrasonography revealed normal blood flow. To establish long-term CV access for dialysis, we planned to insert a Soft Cell™ catheter (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Under sonographic guidance, the operator attempted catheter insertion into the right IJV. A guidewire was inserted into the superior vena cava (SVC) under fluoroscopy.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】( **A** ) Enhanced CT shows the thrombus in the IJV (arrow). ( **B** ) Intrathoracic perforation of the IJV by the introducer (arrowhead). ( **C** ) Three-dimensional CT shows the intrathoracic perforation of the introducer (arrowhead).\n\n【9】During the procedure, the operator noted incorrect orientation of the introducer tip, which appeared positioned within the thoracic cavity. The inner cylinder was withdrawn, revealing no blood flow. A small pneumothorax developed due to air ingress via the outer cylinder, which was immediately capped. The operator suspected inadvertent placement of the introducer into the thoracic cavity; therefore, we were consulted to assist with its removal. The patient’s vital signs were stable, and there was no hemothorax; therefore, immediate CT was performed to localize the perforation. No perforation was found in the right clavicular artery and SVC; however, an intrathoracic perforation through the IJV was observed . Therefore, we performed a four-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with differential lung ventilation in the left lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia ( Video 1 ). To prevent massive hemorrhage upon removal, we contemplated surface compression and intrathoracic compression in case of a perforation involving only the IJV, and a median sternotomy in case of arterial perforation.\n\n【10】The introducer did not injure the lung, although an intrapleural hematoma was observed around the perforation site . After dissecting the mediastinal pleura, we confirmed a venous perforation without arterial perforation .\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】( **A** ) Thoracoscopic view of the intrathoracic perforation of the introducer. ( **B** ) The introducer did not injure the subclavian artery (arrow) and perforated only the IJV.\n\n【14】After removing the introducer, a human fibrinogen-thrombin patch and oxidized regenerated cellulose were applied from within the thoracic cavity to achieve pressure hemostasis. We simultaneously achieved pressure hemostasis from the body surface.\n\n【15】After successful hemostasis, the mediastinal pleura was sutured to coaptation (operative time, 98 min; bleeding, 2 g). The postoperative course was uneventful; 3 days later, a dialysis catheter was inserted through the right femoral vein. During follow-up, 1.5 years after the surgery, the patient was alive.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】A CV catheter can be lifesaving; however, its insertion is associated with potentially severe complications, including hemo- and/or pneumothorax, nerve injury, major bleeding, catheter-related bloodstream infection and venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–6 \\]</u>. Patients requiring CV catheters often have complex pathologies, and the morbidities associated with CV insertion further complicate treatment. Prospective randomized trials and meta-analyses have suggested that the use of ultrasonography when placing IJV catheters reduces complication rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Our operator performed venipuncture using ultrasonography; however, intrathoracic perforation occurred.\n\n【18】In this case, CT showed an IJV thrombus related to a prior CV catheterization; however, ultrasonography confirmed blood flow in the IJV, suggesting that the guidewire could be placed into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. When inserting the introducer, an incorrect insertion angle might have led to contralateral perforation, and thrombus may have contributed. Applying excessive force when the introducer cannot be advanced is dangerous. Care is required during catheter insertion into a thrombosed vessel, and puncture should be avoided. In this case, inserting a temporary femoral venous dialysis catheter may have been considered. In addition, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stent placement has been suggested as the preferred approach to CV stenosis.\n\n【19】If a large venous catheter perforates into the intrathoracic cavity, a massive hemopneumothorax may occur, requiring surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient’s vital signs were stable, and no hemothorax was observed on fluoroscopy. Therefore, we performed a CT scan to examine the perforation in detail. If the catheter is removed immediately after vessel perforation, massive bleeding may result, and the injured vessel may be difficult to identify.\n\n【20】With massive venous bleeding, or subclavian artery perforation, thoracoscopic hemostasis may be dangerous. These injuries are conventionally managed using open surgical exploration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of thoracoscopic surgery for catheter-related subclavian artery or vein injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient’s vital signs were stable after the inadvertent puncture. After thin-slice (0.5 mm) CT examination of the traumatized area, we suspected an IJV puncture without hemothorax. Even if only the IJV is injured, if a large catheter reaches the thoracic cavity, the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity may cause massive hemothorax. In addition, confirming that only the IJV is injured is impossible if enhanced CT is foregone because of the emergency. To date, reports of thoracoscopic hemostasis have identified hemothorax after CV catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In this case, we suspected a misplacement into the thoracic cavity during the insertion of the introducer. In such cases, if the introducer is removed immediately, massive bleeding may occur, and it may be difficult to identify the injured vessel. Therefore, the catheter was removed with thoracoscopic support in anticipation of massive bleeding due to subclavian artery or vein injury.\n\n【21】In conclusion, caution should be exercised while inserting CV catheters through a thrombosed IJV. Even with correct guidewire placement under fluoroscopy, the introducer might be inserted incorrectly. In catheter-related vessel injury, combined external and thoracoscopic hemostasis may be a reliable and minimally invasive option.\n\n【22】AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n--------------------\n\n【23】ST: Conceptualization; Data curation; Writing—original draft.

The treatment of nail psoriasis is essential to improve the health outcomes and quality of life among patients. Pain associated with intralesional injections, inadequate penetration into the nail and underlying tissue, poor adherence to therapy, limited efficacy and recurrent relapses are among the many challenging issues with topical therapy. While conventional systemic therapies are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis. We report a case of nail psoriasis improved with treatment by risankizumab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Psoriasis is a widespread chronic skin condition mediated by the immune system. It affects the skin, nails and joints with systemic involvement and has a major negative impact on the quality of life of affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Psoriasis has a global prevalence of 2% with observed regional variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Psoriasis has various clinical manifestations and subtypes, with psoriasis vulgaris being the most common. It classically presents as well-demarcated, erythematous, itchy plaques covered with silvery scales 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis demonstrate nail involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This percentage can reach up to 90% in patients with psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis can impair the quality of life as it may trigger a major social issue, and if left untreated, progress to weaken the nails that can lead to impairment of function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nail psoriasis is challenging to treat and is often resistant to treatment. On the other hand, treating it improves patients’ health outcomes and standard of living 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Nails are known to be epidermal appendages, and are as such, usually affected by psoriasis. Nail disease clinically can involve either the matrix, the nail bed or the periungual tissue, depending on the origin of the inflammatory phase, resulting in distinct injury patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Features such as leukonychia, pitting (punctures or cupuliform depressions), red spots in the lunula and crumbling can result in patients with nail matrix involvement. Onycholysis, salmon or oil-drop patches, subungual hyperkeratosis and splinter hemorrhages may be caused by nail bed involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Psoriasis therapy has advanced tremendously. While conventional systemic therapies as well as intralesional corticosteroids are still useful and often appropriate for some patients, other treatment options are required for a large proportion of patients, with anticipated improvement in effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】There are many challenging issues that we face when treating patients with nail psoriasis which can include: pain associated with intralesional injections, side effects and monitoring of systemic medications, inadequate penetration of topical medications into the nail and underlying tissue and patient adherence to therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【10】We report a case of a 20-year-old male who is not known to have any medical illnesses. He presented with a 2-year history of nail dystrophy and tenderness. It initially involved the left thumb nail then progressed to involve almost all fingernails. Patient denied any history of skin lesions or joint pain. Moreover, no similar history was noted in the family. He visited the primary care clinic where he was diagnosed with onychomycosis based on positive nail culture for candida albicans and treated accordingly with oral terbinafine for 2 weeks then he was given oral fluconazole 300 mg once weekly for 6 weeks. However, no improvement was noted upon follow-up and the patient was referred to dermatology.

However, the efficacy of these medications in nail disease is limited, primarily due to the difficulty of penetrating the nail bed and nail matrix and the lack of patient compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Current evidence indicates that highly selective agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), anti-interleukin (IL)-17 and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies that are primarily available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have also demonstrated long-term efficacy in the treatment of nail psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively targets the special human IL-23 p19 subunit without binding to IL-12.

However, it involved almost all of the fingernails, significantly impairing his quality of life and resulting in significant distress. Therefore, biologic agents were the desirable option by the patient given their efficacy and quick results. Edward _et al._ proposed a practical treatment algorithm for nail psoriasis depending on the number of nails involved and the significance of skin and joint involvement and quality of life impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Similar to our patient’s response to adalimumab, TNF-alpha inhibitors are known to cause paradoxical psoriasis or worsening of pre-existing psoriasis when used for chronic immune-mediated diseases, primarly inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】In one study comparing a placebo, ustekinumab and risankizumab, risankizumab demonstrated excellent efficacy with higher Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 rates, along with a convenient maintenance dosing regimen every 12 weeks. Risankizumab was well tolerated, with upper respiratory tract infection being the most frequent adverse event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】This case represents the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in the treatment of nail psoriasis unresponsive to adalimumab.

There is no sign of changes in the immune status, but three herpes viruses were detected in the patient’s blood (EBV, HHV6 and HHV8). He received ABVD chemotherapy and achieved complete metabolic remission for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Moreover, the signs of the disseminated KS were resolved. Our observations indicate that a combination of distinct types of viruses may play an important role in triggering the development of angio- and lymphoproliferative disorders in the same person. In addition, treatment with chemotherapy cycles, which included doxorubicin and vinblastine, led to the stable remission of both diseases.\n\n【2】Kaposi sarcoma , Hodgkin’s lymphoma , EBV , HHV6 , HHV8\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade angio-proliferative mesenchymal disorder caused by the herpes virus of the eighth type (HHV8). The mechanisms of HHV8 action on the host cells are not fully understood, although the latest data suggest that HHV8 infects vascular endothelial cells, leading to cell reprogramming and transformation by the induction of the LJVE1, VEGFR3 and PDPN genes, whose expressions are pivotal for cancer development. Morphologically, KS consists of spindle cells carrying markers of the endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34), lymphatic epithelium cells (VEGFR3, D2-40 and LYVE-1), macrophages (CD68) and smooth muscles (SMA) and the marker of the viral damage (LANA-1; latency-associated nuclear Ag). The herpes virus is associated with KS and primary diffusion lymphoma and HIV-associated Castleman disease. The most common classical variant is typically characterized by a benign course. In 90% of cases, the affected organ is the skin with epithelia and internal organ involvement not exceeding 10%. Disseminated KS variants are more typical for HIV-positive patients, transplant recipients and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. We report a case of the disseminated form of KS in an HIV-negative patient diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) that was successfully treated.\n\n【5】**Figure 1**\n\n【6】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【7】The KS images (A) on the hand and (B) on the feet finger.\n\n【8】**Figure 2**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Histology and IHC of KS specimens: (A) biopsy of a colonic KS lesion (H&E, original magnification 10x).

Since July 2017, he had periodically experienced upper abdominal pain and several episodes of black tarry stools associated with weight loss (10 kg over 5 months). His hemoglobin gradually dropped from 130 to 67 g/L. During the physical exam, reddish-blue nodules (up to 1 cm in diameter) were found on the right palm, fourth finger of the right hand and left foot, and multiple small (2–3 mm) round nodules were found in the subcutaneous fatty tissue of the upper and lower extremities . These skin lesions had existed for 4 years. The endoscopy showed multiple bright red polypoid lesions in the stomach. Similar changes were found in the duodenum. A colonoscopy revealed multiple large hyper-vascularized dark-reddish flat lesions. The colon, gastric and skin biopsies showed histological features of KS . The proliferating spindle cell expressed CD34 and PDPN . Anti-HHV8 antibodies were detected in the blood. A diagnosis of KS was made.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】PET scan imaging: (A) PET scan on January 2018 at the time of diagnosis, shoving hypermetabolic paraclavicularic, retropectoral and axillary lymph nodes .

(H) NLPHL with positive LMP1 expression noted in the LP and T cells (original magnification 400x).\n\n【19】At the moment of the diagnosis, the patient had a white blood cell count of 5300 with 1760/mm <sup>3 </sup> lymphocytes (734.58/mm <sup>3 </sup> CD4+ and 378.40/mm <sup>3 </sup> CD8+). His immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were in the normal range (IgA 1.95 g/L, IgG 8.87 g/L and IgM 0.69 g/L). Thus, no abnormalities in the immune status were detected. The patient was negative for HIV antibodies, but EBV DNA and HHV6 DNA were detected in the blood. Then, the patient was found with right axillary lymphadenopathy. In January 2018, a PET scan at the time of diagnosis showed hypermetabolic axillar and subclavicular lymphadenopathies . Morphological and immunohistochemical studies of the affected lymph node biopsy showed a picture of the nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). He received a total of five cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin 40 mg IV, KD 80 mg; bleomycin 15 mg IV/KD 30 mg; vinblastine 10 mg IV/KD 20 mg; and dacarbazine 600 mg, KD 1200 mg) during days 1–15 of the course. The PET scan in May 2018 revealed a complete metabolic response . The colonoscopy and endoscopy were normal. In December 2019, 19 months after the last ABVD course, our patient was still in complete remission of his lymphoma . The DNA of the EBV and HHV6 viruses became undetectable in the blood. No sign of KS recurrence was found in the gastrointestinal tract, but the patient had several new KS nodules on his right foot . The patient is under continuous observation.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】Based on the cases described in the literature, it is possible to conclude that KS development is typically associated with a patient’s immunosuppression of different origins, such as HIV and/or herpes virus infections, post-transplantation therapy and anticancer chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, cases of KS in HIV-negative patients without deterioration of the immune status also have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. In the case of our patient, we did not find any changes in the immune status. All parameters were in the normal range: IgA 1.95 g/L, IgG 8.87 g/L, IgM 0.69 g/L, CD4 42.2% (N 36–55) and CD8 21.5% (N 17-37)). No concomitant immunosuppressive diseases or HIV infection was found. However, we found HHV6/EBV DNA and an antibody against the HHV8 virus in the patient’s plasma.\n\n【22】Every virus in this combination is involved in carcinogenesis. Moreover, KS is associated with HHV8, whereas EBV plays an important role in the development of classical HL (cHL), and HHV6 establishes latency in lymphocytes and possesses a strong immunomodulatory capacity that can trigger both immunosuppressive and chronic inflammatory pathways.\n\n【23】In our case, we made the NLPHL diagnosis using morphological and IHC studies . The NLPHL is a rare subtype of HL, representing 5% of all cases. In contrast to cHL, it is generally considered EBV negative (4–5% EBV-positive cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the biopsy of our patient, we found the EBV marker LMP1 and weak CD30 positive staining, which is typical for the EBV-positive NLPHL  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Hence, our patient had a rare type of HL associated with EBV.\n\n【24】These facts support the hypothesis that the combination of viruses plays a key role in the development of NLPHL and KS in our patient. The precise mechanism of this process is not yet clear, but the influence of EBV/HHV6/HHV8 on lymphoid cells may lead to the deterioration of the apoptotic process and the development of indolent immunodeficiency, which triggered the development of two neoplastic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, we would like to note an aggressive course of KS, which is atypical for HIV-negative patients. Multiple foci of skin lesions on the upper and lower extremities, damage to the gastrointestinal tract and, consequently, repeated bleeding provide a characteristic picture of the increasing anemia. In the literature, the recommended therapy for KS is liposomal doxorubicin, vinblastine and taxane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u> The patient’s polychemotherapy courses for the underlying disease (HL) contained the recommended doxorubicin and vinblastine. Thus, the therapy was equally successful in achieving the remission of both diseases: KS and HL. The patient remains in complete PET/CT remission for 19 months after the end of HL therapy. The KS lesions were not detected by the control colonoscopy and endoscopy, but new lesions appeared on the skin of the lower limb. The DNA of the herpes virus was not detected by the PCR. Further follow-up of the patient will continue.\n\n【25】Thus, we described for the first time the case of the parallel development of HL and KS on the background of the infection with three herpes viruses. This demonstrates the importance of viruses in cancer development, although further studies of the precise mechanisms are needed.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】No conflict of interest declared.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】This work was approved by the ethical committee of the Main Military Clinical Hospital named after N.N.

It is followed by hyperglycemia, and other systemic diseases. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea associated with the same etiology have been reported, but cases with different etiologies have rarely been reported. We report a case in which the patient experienced both strokes and post-stroke-related hyperglycemic hemichorea. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain appeared different in these two episodes. Our case demonstrates the importance of evaluating every patient presented with recurrent hemichorea carefully, as the disorder may be caused by different conditions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The unilateral movement disorder, hemichorea, commonly stems from acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of contralateral cerebral lesions and is typically followed by hyperglycemia and other systemic diseases, such as hypoglycemia, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Several cases of recurrent hemichorea have been reported and associated with the same etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–5 \\]</u>, However, different etiologies could contribute to the recurrence of hemichorea in the same patient.

In this work, we report a case of recurrent same-side hemichorea with different etiologies diagnosed by brain MRI images.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 58-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes for 12 years was presented at our hospital 4 years ago. Because of poor compliance, the patient has not been able to achieve the target glycemic treatment goal during the past 4 years. We observed two episodes of right hemichorea resulting in similar involuntary movements but in different brain MRI images and etiologies.\n\n【6】### The first episode\n\n【7】The first episode of right hemichorea brought him to our emergency room 2 weeks after a fall. Hyperglycemia (712 mg/dl) was also noted at that time. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain disclosed no specific findings. He was admitted and an MRI scan of the brain showed an old lacunar infarct at the left basal ganglion . His right hemichorea was resolved the day after admission without any treatment of the disorder. He had no neurologic deficit. Basal bolus insulin therapy was given for blood sugar control, and aspirin was given to prevent recurrent stroke after discharge.\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】MR FLAIR image demonstrated one tiny hyperintensity lesion on basal ganglia (arrow) in patient’s first admission.\n\n【11】### The second episode\n\n【12】After 4 years of follow-ups in the outpatient department, the patient’s compliance was still poor. He was hospitalized because of involuntary movement in his right upper limb and right jaw for 2 weeks. The involuntary movement subsided when he fell asleep. The neurological examination showed that muscle power and sensation of bilateral limbs were intact. His blood sugar was high (671 mg/dl) without ketoacidosis. The serum creatinine level was normal, and the HbA1c was 17.3%. A CT scan of brain showed increased density in the left basal ganglia . Further MRI scan was also performed to exclude acute stroke and disclosed an increased signal intensity on the T1-weighted image in left basal ganglion , which was compatible with hyperglycemic hemichorea. Initially, we prescribed Clonazepam and haloperidol for the hemichorea and basal bolus insulin for the hyperglycemia. His blood sugar improved dramatically, but the hemichorea only improved a little after 10 days of hospitalization. He was discharged with Clonazepam 0.5 mg QD for the hemichorea, and basal insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control. Two weeks later at an outpatient visit, his hemichorea improved gradually because the blood sugar was better controlled.\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Brain CT scan showed increased density in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.\n\n【16】Figure 3\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】T1 MRI showed hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia (arrow) during patient’s second admission.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】We reported a case of recurrent hemichorea in a 58-year-old man exhibiting different etiologies demonstrated by specific brain MRI findings. The most common cause of hemichorea is acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and the second is hyperglycemic hemichorea. Other causes including hypoglycemia, Sydenham’s disease, uremia and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome have also been reported. These different etiologies of hemichorea result in different brain imaging appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Typically, in hyperglycemic hemichorea, CT scans show hyperdense lesions at the contralateral basal ganglia and T1 MRI shows hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Both the CT and T1 MRI of our patient showed similar features. In an acute stroke, the MRI demonstrates lesions with hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images and with hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In an old ischemic stroke, MR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images demonstrate hyperintensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In hypoglycemia, T2 hyperintensity was noted at the basal ganglia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In uremia, T2 hyperintensity lesions with edematous and a rim enhancement were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, the MRI is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of the causes of hemichorea.\n\n【21】In addition, hyperglycemic hemichorea is a rare neurologic complication of poorly controlled diabetes, which was first described by Bedwell in 1960 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Most cases were old Asian women. The prognosis of hyperglycemic hemichorea was good and rare recurrences were reported after blood sugar was better controlled. The mean recovery days of hyperglycemic hemichorea is about 69 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, according to a recent report in Korea. Blood sugar control is key for the recovery of hyperglycemic hemichorea and neuroimage findings on follow-up MRIs are usually reversible as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In our patient, recurrent hemichorea with different etiologies was diagnosed primarily based on different neuroimaging findings, but also based on differences in the durations of the courses. The duration of the hemichorea was short for the first episode and diagnosed to be stroke related. The duration of the hemichorea was longer for the second episode and was diagnosed to be hyperglycemia related. This could be caused by the different etiologies or by hyperglycemic stress superimposed on the same atherosclerotic lesion.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【23】None.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】This work was supported by grant FEMH-2022-C-013 from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】None required.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】A written and signed informed consent for publication of clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the patient.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Rong Lin is the guarantor of this case report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer. At the time of diagnosis, a patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presented with voiding difficulties, feeble stream, terminal dribbling and incomplete voiding. The urethral tumor was diagnosed using cystoscopy, and biopsy was thereafter performed. Histopathology of the urethral tumor microscopically resembled to that of esophageal cancer. On immunohistochemistry, the urothelium markers uroplakin 2 and GATA3 were negative in the carcinomatous component; however, GATA3 was detected on the lesion’s surface. This case demonstrated that esophageal cancer metastasized to the urethra. Medical oncologists should consider this diagnosis in patients with cancer presenting with dysuria.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】More than 30% of patients with esophageal cancers are diagnosed with metastatic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, adrenals and bone. Urethral malignancies are rare, accounting for less than 1% of malignant tumors, and can cause urethral stenosis, which often occurs with dysuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Urethral metastasis commonly arises from prostate and bladder cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. No previous information was found in literature reporting on urethral metastases secondary to esophageal cancer. We report a case of urethral metastasis of esophageal cancer that was diagnosed via urethrocystoscopy in a patient complaining of dysuria.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 61-year-old Japanese man presented with anorexia noted 2 months prior. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable. He had been drinking three bottles of beer daily for over 40 years and smoking one to two packs of cigarettes daily for more than 45 years. The patient was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma of the lower thoracic segment based on the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings. At the same time, endoscopy also exposed a superficial hypopharyngeal cancer as a synchronous malignancy. Endoscopic biopsy and histopathology revealed non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography showed multiple pulmonary and liver masses and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. This included the right supraclavicular, mediastinal, paraaortic and right inguinal lymph nodes. Accordingly, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer with distant metastases (cT4aN4M1, stage IVB, according to the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification system 8th edition).\n\n【6】At the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis, the patient also reported voiding difficulties, specifically, a poor stream, terminal dribbling and incomplete voiding. Routine urine tests revealed no traces of blood or protein remnants. The urine red blood cell count was 2.2/HPF and the white blood cell count was 2.6/HPF. Atypical cells were not detected on urine cytology. The patient was referred to a urologist, who performed a cystourethroscopy for a palpable penile lump. Cystourethroscopy revealed a smooth nodular, 5-mm mass in the penile urethra . A transurethral biopsy was then performed. The bladder mucosa was smooth, and there were no notable abnormalities in the left and right urethral openings.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Cystourethroscopy revealed a 5-mm smooth nodular mass in the penile urethra.\n\n【10】Microscopically, the urethral tumor showed abundant nuclear pleomorphism and was identified as a non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Its characteristics were similar to those of the esophageal tumor . Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for p40, indicating a squamous cell carcinoma . On immunohistochemistry, the urothelium markers, uroplakin 2 and GATA3 were negative in the carcinomatous component ; however, GATA3 was detected on the surface of the lesion . Accordingly, the urethral tumor was diagnosed as a metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】The urethral tumor showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma consistent with esophageal cancer (A); immunohistochemical section of urethral tumor was positive for (B) p40 and negative for (C) uroplakin 2 and (D) GATA3; GATA3 expression at the normal urothelium was observed (E).\n\n【14】The patient underwent immediate radiotherapy and chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) to achieve local control. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the patient underwent chemotherapy with 5-FU and CDDP for metastatic disease. Following treatment, his dysuria was resolved, and he could urinate without discomfort. The follow-up period was ~3 months.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】We have reported a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer. This case highlights two essential findings. First, esophageal cancer can metastasize to the urethra, resulting in voiding difficulties. Second, cystoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool for metastatic urethral tumors.\n\n【17】Esophageal cancer can metastasize to the urethra, and urethral metastatic tumors should be suspected in cancer patients presenting with dysuria. Metastatic tumors of the urethra occur more frequently than primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several reports of metastasis from the colon and rectum, lungs and breast are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>; however, urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer has not previously been reported.\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】The esophageal tumor contained moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【21】Urethral metastasis was diagnosed by histopathological analysis of the sample obtained via transurethral biopsy. Cystoscopy revealed a smooth nodular mass that did not extend to the surrounding urothelium. Primary urethral tumors commonly extend beyond or above the surface. Moreover, they exhibit a cobbled appearance with a papillary surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, the tumor’s characteristics differed from the typical primary urethral carcinoma. Microscopically, it was diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. The carcinomatous component was negative for GATA-3 and uroplakin II on immunohistochemical analysis. However, these markers were positive on the surface of the normal urothelium surrounding the tumor. GATA-3 and uroplakin II are novel markers for primary urethral carcinoma and are positive in 99 and 80% of malignant urothelial tumors, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The immunohistochemical findings, in this case, indicated metastasis of esophageal cancer to the urethra, and the tumor might have arisen from the stroma, which is beneath the urothelium.\n\n【22】The proposed hypotheses for urethral metastasis include the lymphatic, arterial or venal routes or direct invasion, although direct invasion is anatomically impossible. Kaushal _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported a case of inguinal lymph node metastasis from a gastroesophageal junction carcinoma. The patient had bilateral inguinal lymph node swelling with multiple enlarged paraaortic, iliac and pelvic lymph nodes. The authors hypothesized that metastasis was due to the retrograde flow through paraaortic nodes to the pelvic and inguinal nodes. While our patient had right inguinal node swelling, he did not have pelvic lymph node metastasis; therefore, it is likely that the underlying mechanisms differ. In a study describing unexpected sites of metastases secondary to esophageal cancer, distal isolated metastases via the lymphatic route were scarcely explained. The authors postulated that tumor embolisms pass through the main artery to the distal isolated organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We propose that distal urethral tumors flow into the right inguinal lymph node via the hematologic route. Although inguinal lymph node metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer is rare, we should consider the possibility of a urethral tumor in patients presenting with inguinal lymph node swelling.\n\n【23】Herein, we report a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Despite its rarity, medical oncologists should consider this diagnosis in cancer patients presenting with dysuria.\n\n【24】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【25】We want to thank Editage  for English language editing.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】None of the authors received any funding for this study.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】This case report was approved by the institute’s Institutional Review Board.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Written consent was obtained from the patient for this publication.\n\n【34】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【35】Ikumi Kuno is the guarantor of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The tumor clinically behaves in a benign manner and has a good prognosis. In some cases, however, PSP reportedly displays pathologically malignant characteristics such as lymph node metastases and necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These heterogenetic cases suggest that PSP has a clinico-pathological diversity. Herein, we present a case of a large PSP with massive necrosis and vascular invasions.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 64-year-old woman presented with a cough and breathlessness. She was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow over the whole left chest area and a mediastinal shift on chest radiography . Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 15 × 14 × 10 cm mass filling almost the entire left thoracic cavity, which had an extensive low-density area on enhancement . There were also multiple nodules in the opposite lung . Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT revealed a mild Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation within the tumor in the left thorax and one nodule in the right lung, and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) were 6.5 and 2.3, respectively . Although the large tumor size, massive necrosis and the multiple nodules in the opposite lung suggested advanced lung cancer, the mild accumulation of FDG seemed atypical. Furthermore, her general condition was relatively good considering advanced cancer. Subsequent CT-guided tumor biopsy showed a proliferation of round cells with central bland nuclei and low nuclear atypia that were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and low Ki-67 labeling index (<5%). These findings raised PSP as a differential diagnosis in a multidisciplinary board. We, therefore, performed a left pneumonectomy to obtain the definite diagnosis and to palliate the symptoms caused by the rightward mediastinal shift.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Results of laboratory imaging techniques. ( **A** ) Chest radiography and ( **B** ) chest CT revealed a large mass measuring 15 × 14 × 10 cm in size present in the left lung with an extensive low-density area in the center of the tumor, thereby raising a suspicion of hemorrhage and necrosis; chest radiography also revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung. ( **C** ) Multiple small nodules ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 cm in diameter were also found in the right lung. One nodule was located in the upper lobe, and the others were in the lower lobe. ( **D** ) PET–CT confirmed a weak FDG accumulation within the large mass and in only the right upper lung nodule, with SUV <sub>max </sub> of 6.5 and 2.3, respectively.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Histopathological findings (B–F: hematoxylin and eosin (HE) method). ( **A** ) The resected specimen contained a well-demarcated yellowish tumor with massive central necrosis, encompassing 80% of the tumor mass. ( **B** ) Papillary growth shows a dual population of cuboidal surface cells overlaying stromal round cells. ( **C** ) Each tumor cell was uniform, round or polygonal, with round bland nuclei having no nucleoli and a fine chromatin. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic, and nuclear fission was scarcely observed.

The tumor progressed expansively in the lungs and was well encapsulated. There were a dual population of cuboidal surface cells overlaying stromal round cells  with little nuclear atypia , showing various proliferation patterns: papillary, solid, sclerotic and hemorrhagic . There was no lymph node metastasis; however, endobronchial locations and vascular invasions were observed . The Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed overall labeling index of 5% with partially highly-proliferating areas of up to 30% . Tumor cells were positive for TTF-1, epithelial membrane antigen, progesterone receptor and vimentin and focally positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and cytokeratin-7 . The patient was consequently diagnosed as atypical PSP with massive necrosis and vascular invasions.\n\n【13】**Figure 3**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Unusual Pathological findings and IHC findings. ( **A** ) Endobronchial lesions were observed in the tumor (hematoxylin and eosin (HE) method). ( **B** ) Vascular invasion occurred in the tumor (Verhoeff-van-Gieson (VVG) method). ( **C** ) Ki-67 labeling index was totally <5% with partially highly-proliferating areas of up to 30%. ( **D** – **F** ) The tumor cells were positive for (D) TTF-1, (E) epithelial membrane antigen and (F) progesterone receptor.\n\n【16】Six months after the primary surgery, the largest nodule in the right lung was resected because of increase in size from 1.3 to 1.9 cm and was diagnosed as PSP with similar pathological findings to the left lung tumor: dual population of tumor cells with various proliferation patterns, positivity of IHC, such as progesterone receptor, and multiple vascular invasions. We inferred that the nodules were multiple synchronous diseases, but it was difficult to distinguish from metastasis from the left tumor.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】PSP is relatively rare benign tumor with four distinct histological patterns: solid, papillary, sclerotic and hemorrhagic. According to some recent studies, PSP is considered to originate from primitive respiratory epithelium and is characterized as a tumor of pneumocytic origin with a dual population of cuboidal surface cells and stromal round cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. Therefore, PSP was reclassified as adenoma from the previous category of miscellaneous tumors in the 2015 World Health Organization Classification, and its name was changed from ‘sclerosing hemangioma’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PSP clinically behaves in a benign manner. One study showed that the doubling time of PSP is 660–1250 days, which is slower than that of malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The prognosis after surgical resection is generally good, and deaths have not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】On the other hand, clinically malignant findings such as lymph node metastasis are reported to occur in approximately 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>, which makes difficult to distinguish from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (predominantly solid subtype). Histopathological characteristics such as dual population of tumor cells with little nuclear atypia, various proliferation patterns and IHC results confirmed the definitive diagnosis, however, the present case had some atypical characteristics for PSP as follows.\n\n【20】Firstly, the tumor size of 15 cm was noteworthy. Although two previous reports have reported PSPs of more than 10 cm, the present case was the largest one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Secondly, a massive necrosis, endobronchial lesion and multifocal lesions were observed. Previous reports showed that necrosis, multifocal and endobronchial lesion were rarely observed in PSP, and the incidences were 8% 4% and 1%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Thirdly, vascular invasion was observed, which has not been reported to date.\n\n【21】We did not perform genetic studies because its utility to distinguish synchronous PSPs from metastasis reportedly has not been established at this time. However, recent study of genetic analysis for multiple synchronous PSP identified mutations in genes, which may provide the clues to elucidate the nature of PSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Further, histopathological and genetic studies are very interesting and may clarify the feature and diversity of PSP.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this case suggested that PSP had a variety of histopathological findings and sometimes could show an aggressive clinical feature like advanced lung cancer.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding\n-------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval\n----------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National Cancer Center Hospital IRB approval number: 2017–418.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent\n-------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We obtained comprehensive informed consent from the patient before this study.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Guarantor\n---------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5c9bffd0-0462-4fb6-847c-ba7d5a566d62", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT\n--------\n\n【1】Cardiac amyloidosis has been strongly associated with postoperative intractable circulatory failure, and intestinal amyloidosis could lead to intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The latter can be treated with neostigmine, which is notorious for its brief bradyarrhythmic complications. The amyloidosis patient presented herein, suffered an iatrogenic left main dissection, failure of bailout stenting and finally underwent urgent surgery. Meticulous fluid and drug management was key to keeping this patient stable. Postoperative atrial fibrillation was treated with amiodarone. The postoperative course was complicated with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, which was ultimately resolved with neostigmine. This short-lived cholinesterase inhibitor interacted with amiodarone and caused a previously undocumented prolonged complete atrioventricular block that resolved 48 hours after both drugs’ discontinuation. The neostigmine amiodarone interaction warrants clinical vigilance and is speculated to be due to their partially shared second messenger pathway involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis could maintain hemodynamic stability perioperatively.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Timely diagnosis of amyloidosis can be a challenge. The first manifestations, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, should raise suspicion as they may occur many years before cardiac involvement which is very common and associated with increased mortality. Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple manifestations, including restrictive cardiomyopathy, angina and conduction abnormalities. Often, suspicion arises from the granular appearance of the myocardium in cardiac ultrasound. The cardiac walls are thick while the QRS voltages are low. Ischemia in these patients frequently results from small vessel disease, whereas the epicardial vessels are typically spared. When the latter are involved, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been associated with intractable circulatory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal tract has multiple manifestations as well. They include abdominal pain and distention, tenderness, malabsorption, bowel dilatation, mesenteric adenopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO). Surgery has been suggested as the last resort for the latter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, which is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Neostigmine has been proven invaluable for the treatment of intestinal pseudo-obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, yet it has been inculpated for several side-effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, such as arrhythmia, while some of its interactions may remain unknown.\n\n【5】We, hereby, present an amyloidosis patient with iatrogenic left main stem dissection who survived urgent CABG. Postoperative management with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation (AF), and neostigmine for IPO led to a previously undocumented, prolonged complete atrioventricular block with potentially grave consequences, had it not been for the pacemaker.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 74-year-old male presented with exertional angina. He was a well-built farmer in no distress, complaining of intermittent substernal pain and peripheral edema. His medical history was significant for constipation and prostatic hyperplasia treated with silodosin. The clinical and laboratory tests were within normal limits but imaging was revealing . The electrocardiogram showed trifascicular block . The ultrasonography revealed thickened cardiac walls, small pericardial effusion and biatrial enlargement. Thus, suspicion of amyloidosis was raised. The ejection fraction by Simpson’s biplane method was estimated to 50%, with no regional wall motion abnormality. However, longitudinal myocardial systolic strain by 2D speckle tracking showed far more significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Global longitudinal strain measured −13.2% (normal −15.9% to −22.1%) and regional strain values were greatly reduced in the basal and mid LV, yet preserved at the LV apex. The coronary angiogram, using 6Fr Judkins right 4, and Judkins left 4 catheters, demonstrated two vessel disease, but it was complicated with dissection of the left main stem. The initial attempts for bailout stenting failed, thus urgent surgery was indicated despite the unfavorable results in amyloidosis patients.\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Preoperative imaging. At the left, the cardiac ultrasound demonstrated the sparkling pattern of the thickened myocardial walls, especially the intraventricular septum (red arrow) (video online). The atria were enlarged (asterisks). In the middle, the global longitudinal strain was measured −13.2% against a normal range of −15.9% to −22.1%. Regional strain values were greatly reduced in the basal and mid LV, yet preserved at the LV apex. At the right, the coronary angiography was complicated with dissection of the left main stem (black arrow).\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Preoperative electrocardiogram showing trifascicular block.\n\n【14】The patient underwent urgent grafting of the left anterior descending and the obtuse marginal arteries, while temporary epicardial pacing wires were placed as part of the standard surgical procedure. Biopsy specimens were collected  and confirmed light chain amyloidosis. The patient was extubated on the first postoperative day (POD). The perioperative fluid management was meticulous to prevent hemodynamic deterioration, bet- blockers were not administered, and silodosin was withheld to avoid hypotensive vasodilation. Mild positive fluid balance was the mainstay of early postoperative management, and electrolyte control was tight.\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Amyloid deposits were found in atrial and ventricular walls.

Panel D: Same area as C observed by polarizing microscope. Note the green-apple birefringence of the deposits. Magnification ×400).\n\n【18】Early postoperative mild abdominal distension with absence of gas and stool passage was managed expectantly until POD 3. There were decreased bowel sounds and no tenderness on palpation. The abdominal x-rays revealed small bowel ileus  and the computerized tomography showed no evidence of mechanical obstruction, suggesting IPO. Bowel rest, intravenous (IV) fluids, avoidance of opioids, administration of IV metoclopramide, nasogastric tube placement and low enemas were unsuccessful. Gastrografin per os and repeat colonic evacuation provided only partial relief. The distressed patient lapsed into atrial fibrillation on POD 5 and was managed with IV amiodarone. The loading dose was 5 mg/min (300 mg in 1 hour), and the maintenance dose was 0.65 mg/min (900 mg in 23 hours) to 0.83 mg/min (1200 mg in 24 hours). These rates of IV infusion did not affect the pre-existing heart block. On POD 7, sinus rhythm was restored and amiodarone was changed to per os.\n\n【19】Figure 4\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Dilated bowel loops with fluid levels on the fifth POD. The intestinal pseudo-obstruction was resolved with acetylcholinesterase blockage.\n\n【22】On POD 7, IV neostigmine was administered, despite the concern of complete heart block. The loading dose was 2.5 mg over a few minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg per day. If block occurred, it was anticipated to be brief. This calculated risk evolved into a sustained threat attributed to a yet unknown interaction between amiodarone and neostigmine. On POD 9, the IPO resolved at the expense of a complete heart block. Neostigmine and amiodarone were discontinued and the pacemaker kept the heart beating. Despite expectations, return to sinus rhythm was significantly delayed. Even though neostigmine has a half-life of up to 2 hours, its interaction with amiodarone caused a prolonged complete heart block that persisted ~2 days after the discontinuation of both. The rest of the course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on aspirin 160 mg/day, furosemide 20 mg/day and esomeprazole 40 mg/day. He was referred for hematologic evaluation and further management. At 1 month follow-up, he was still in good general condition. Given the significant cardiac involvement and advanced age, the patient was deemed ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. He was treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD). Diuretic therapy was maintained.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】PCI is strongly preferred for patients with cardiac amyloidosis that require coronary revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, CABG is inevitable under certain conditions, as the case presented herein. It was demonstrated that circulatory failure can be evaded with meticulous perioperative fluid and drug management. Beta-blockers were withheld. Amiodarone monotherapy was event free with IV infusion rates that are much lower than the recommended dose for life-threatening arrhythmias (15 mg/min for 10 minutes). Silodosin, a selective a1A adrenoceptor antagonist, was also withheld to avoid its hypotensive side-effect and the recognized detrimental interaction with amiodarone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Early postoperatively, the patient developed IPO. This acute, life threatening condition is typically associated with gastrointestinal amyloidosis and poor outcomes in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Neostigmine was administered, as the last resort before urgent bowel surgery, and it was proven effective. The conversion of the preoperative trifascicular block to a complete heart block by neostigmine was anticipated. However, coadministrating amiodarone led to the significant prolongation of the block, which was not anticipated, and to an extended dependence on the external pacemaker.\n\n【26】Coadministrating neostigmine and amiodarone appears to have a previously unreported, prolonged drug–drug effect on the cardiac conduction system. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, thus the parasympathetic output to the atrioventricular nodal cells is enhanced by increased acetylcholine concentration. Acetylcholine acts on the muscarinic-2 receptors which mediate, via Gi proteins, a strong inhibition of adenylyl cyclase which leads to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), decreased intracellular calcium, and blunted excitability. This effect on atrioventricular nodal cells is further exacerbated by amiodarone. This drug’s inhibition of the delayed rectifier outward potassium current at phase 3 of the action potential describes its chronic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The acute effect is mediated by decreasing the activity of the L-type calcium channels and blocking the beta 1 adrenergic receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, thus inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and decreasing cAMP, as neostigmine does, though via Gs proteins.\n\n【27】The take home messages include avoidance of amiodarone and neostigmine coadministration in patients without a pacemaker, especially those with conduction disease. Should this prolonged bradyarrhythmia be triggered, its prognosis depends on the hemodynamic impact and the prompt implantation of a pacemaker. In the presence of a temporary pacemaker, amiodarone and neostigmine management might be considered as the prognosis of this bradyarrhythmia appeared good. A permanent pacemaker would render this drug–drug interaction clinically irrelevant. It was also shown that post-CABG prognosis of patients with cardiac amyloidosis might be good if perioperative fluid and drug management is meticulous.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【29】Not applicable.

Among the many cardiac morbidities encountered is that of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CIC) phenotype, with a varying response to therapy in terms of eventual full recovery, and the time required for its attainment. Prevalence of a diagnosis of cancer per se, irrespective of chemotherapeutic drugs used in its management, has been found to be high in patients presenting with takotsubo syndrome (TTS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the mysterious acquired acute cardiomyopathy, which as a rule is completely reversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Increasingly cases of TTS are reported, which are attributed to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, raising concerns among clinicians as to how to proceed with the management of their cancer patients, i.e. to continue employment of their choice combination chemotherapeutic regimen, or seek an alternative. These CIC and TTS conundrums will occupy us all increasingly in the time to come.\n\n【1】Cases in point are the two reports that have been recently published in the _Journal_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The first case by Malley and Watson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> described a 73-year-old woman who suffered TTS on the final day of her 7-day course of chemotherapy with lomustine, cytarabine, cyclophosphomide and etoposide, which she had received for a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The authors appropriately noted that in such cases of chemotherapy-induced TTS, the ‘causality remains to be established and the mechanism of action is not yet fully understood’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The authors refer to the rarity of TTS in patients receiving anthracyclines (contrary to the rather frequent occurrence of CIC) with the more frequent occurrence of TTS with 5-FU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and the association of cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide with CIC, and cytarabine and cyclophosphamide with TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In the absence of specific guidelines to inform a decision about the choice of further chemotherapy (rechallenge with a different drug) in patients who had suffered TTS, avoidance of known cardiotoxic agents appears advisable, and employment of a drug like busulfan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> may be a good choice.\n\n【2】The second case was reported by Abdulrahman _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> on a 41-year-old woman with metastatic esophageal cancer who suffered TTS on Cycle 1, Day 3 of FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy, after disconnection of the infusion pump (‘it is of interest that symptoms occurred following pump disconnection, and that previous doses had been well tolerated’), with symptoms resolving over 2 days, and a return to normal of her transiently compromised left ventricular function (LVF) within 2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The seemingly offending drug (5-FU) was replaced by another fluoropyrimidine agent (capecitabine), commencing in 3 weeks after Cycle 1, without untoward incident, as also noted in a previous report. It is conceivable that the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin is implicated herein, considering the intensified cardiotoxicity when these two agents are administered together 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Also, the third ingredient of FOLFOX (i.e. oxaliplatin) has been linked to TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The authors make a distinction between CIC and TTS resulting by chemotherapeutic agents, refer to CIC recurring in about half of those rechallenged with 5-FU, and provide examples from the literature of many cases of 5-FU associating with CIC or TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】There are many things we do not know and need to delineate in these _perceived_ associations among cancer, chemotherapy and TTS (and this also applies to CIC): (i) The physical stresses of procedures and surgeries, and the internal turmoil of having cancer, often nor apparent or verbalized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, may be at the roots of TTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. (ii) The increased sympathetic tone and catecholamine release promoted by cancer and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> have not been explored. (iii) Using β-blockers in patients with cancer and/or undergoing chemotherapy has not been systematically considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. (iv) The fuzzy boundaries between CIC and chemotherapy-triggered TTS need exploration. Although the clinical course in TTS is more short-lived in comparison with CIC, this is not always the case since there are cases of CIC with rapid recovery and incidences of TTS with marked delays in the restoration of the LVF to the baseline. (v) It is conceivable that if we start being proactive in checking for rise of catecholamines and cardiac biomarkers and implementing echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, we may find that atypical or milder cases of TTS are more frequent than currently thought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u> in patients with cancer and those receiving chemotherapy. (vi) For patients with cancer and/or receiving chemotherapy, cardiac complaints communicated to their physicians can be further characterized using a patient-operated, ‘smart-phone’-based technology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> in their ambient ambulatory environment. All the above will teach us a lot about cancer, chemotherapy, CIC and TTS, which we do not currently comprehend.\n\n【4】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【5】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It has an estimated rate of heterozygosity in the population of ~13% in Africa, 4% in Asia and 2% in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Acute splenic sequestration crisis (ASSC) is a well-recognized complication in children with SCD but is a rare manifestation in adults with sickle β <sup>+ </sup> \\-thalassemia, and reports are sporadic. It is also not known to occur as a first presentation of the hemoglobinopathy. We report a case of a young female without any significant medical history who presented with symptoms consistent with ASSC and found to have S-β <sup>+ </sup> thalassemia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 20-year-old Guyanese female of Indian descent with no significant medical history presented with a 5-day history of fever and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. This was associated with chills, generalized weakness and abdominal distension. She reported dark brown urine and yellowish discoloration of her eyes but denied nausea, vomiting or change in bowel habits. She had no previous history or family history of anemia, sickle cell disease or any hemoglobinopathy. Vital signs revealed fever with a temperature of 103F and tachycardia. Physical examination was remarkable for conjunctival icterus, abdominal distension, left upper quadrant tenderness and splenomegaly, which was palpable about 12 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies revealed Hb of 6.5 (11.5–15.5) g/dl, hematocrit of 19 (34.5–46.5)%, mean corpuscular volume 64.8 (79.0–95.0) fl, mean corpuscular Hb 22.2 (26.0–32.0) pg and elevated leukocyte count of 14.72 (4.0–11.0) K/uL with a left shift. Iron and total iron binding capacity were low 28 通用删除7(英):<u>(37–170)</u> ug/dl and 168 通用删除7(英):<u>(265–497)</u> ug/dl, respectively, and ferritin elevated: 737 (6.2–137) ng/ml. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated 3420 通用删除7(英):<u>(313–618)</u> u/l with decreased haptoglobin < 15 通用删除7(英):<u>(43–212)</u> mg/dl, and elevated reticulocyte percentage 7.5% (0.5–2.5)%. Liver function test revealed hyperbilirubinemia. Peripheral blood smear showed markedly hypochromic microcytic red blood cells and target cells with increased reticulocytes. Blood culture, urine culture, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, Malaria, Babesia, Bordetella, Brucella, Coxiella, Leptospirosis, Hepatitis and acid fast bacilli were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast revealed massive splenomegaly (22 cm) with a markedly abnormal appearance, consisting of circumferential peripheral and centrally diffuse infiltrative cystic attenuation within the parenchyma . Also, mild hepatomegaly and multiple non-obstructing gallstones were noted . An acute hemolytic anemia was suspected based on the clinical presentation, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH, hemosiderinuria and decreased haptoglobin. Coomb’s test for autoimmune hemolysis was negative as was osmotic fragility test and G6PD assay. Sickling test done was positive and Hb electrophoresis revealed sickle cell trait (AS) with Hb percent consisting of HbA-48% (>96%), HbS-26.8% (0.0%), Hb F-24.0% (<2%) and normal HbA2–1.2% (<3.3%). DNA test for beta globin gene mutation was pending. She was initially managed conservatively with blood transfusion and empiric antibiotics. Symptoms persisted despite supportive treatment; therefore, splenectomy was performed on Day 5 of admission. Pathologic examination of the spleen demonstrated a spleen weighing 1183 gm and measuring 25x14.5x7 cm with peripheral serpiginous yellow infarcts , acute inflammation surrounding the infarcted areas and small capillaries plugged with sickle cell shaped red blood cells consistent with splenic sequestration . Postoperatively, there was a gradual improvement in her clinical symptoms and improvement of Hb to 10.6 g/dl. She was then discharged home with appropriate follow-up. At presentation to clinic 2 weeks later, she was completely asymptomatic. DNA test for beta globin gene mutation revealed heterozygous positive for HbS and c.380\\_396de117 beta-globin mutation consistent with a diagnosis of sickle cell-beta <sup>+ </sup> thalassemia.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Coronal section of CT abdomen with contrast showing massive splenomegaly.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Axial section of CT abdomen with contrast showing massive splenomegaly.\n\n【12】**Figure 3**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Spleen showing subcapsular paler areas corresponding to underlying infarcts.\n\n【15】**Figure 4**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Cross section of the spleen showing peripheral serpiginous yellow infarcts.\n\n【18】**Figure 5**\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】H&E, 40x.

It presents with splenomegaly followed by a sudden drop in Hb. This phenomenon is known to occur in children with sickle cell disease (Hb SS) and adults with Hb SC but occurs rarely with sickle cell-beta thalassemia (Hb S-β thalassemia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> despite the common finding of splenomegaly in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. According to various case reports the association of S-β thalassemia with splenic sequestration crisis is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Based on the complete absence or reduced amounts of beta globin chains, S-β thalassemia is categorized to sickle cell-beta通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>0 </sup></u> thalassemia and sickle cell beta <sup>+ </sup> thalassemia, determined by the level of HbA. The clinical and hematologic severity of S-β thalassemia is an inverse function of HbA quantity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. HbA is absent in Hb S-β <sup>o </sup> thalassemia and has more severe clinical course, similar to SS disease. Hb S-β <sup>+ </sup> thalassemia usually has 20–30% of HbA and a milder clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This may possibly explain the late onset sickling phenomenon and few sickling crises afterward. The quantity of HbA in our patient was 48%, which is higher than the reported average and might explain the lack of clinical symptoms until adulthood. There are no apparent precipitating factors for S-β thalassemia associated ASSC in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, even though some hypothesize that high altitude and infections can precipitate the crisis. In our patient, there was no obvious precipitating factor. Several authors have implied a possible relationship between the acute splenic sequestration syndrome and massive splenic infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Sickling of erythrocytes in efferent channels of the spleen sets off a chain reaction that progressively involves more afferent channels until the entire spleen is infarcted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The findings of substantial infarction at the time of splenectomy, which occurred in this patient as shown in Fig. 3 , is unusual as it has rarely been reported in the literature. Diagnostic modalities include 99mTc/sulfur colloid scan, which shows complete lack of splenic uptake, or CT scan, which may reveal multiple, peripheral, non-enhancing low-density areas or large diffuse areas of low density in the majority of the splenic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> as demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Pathologic examination of the spleen during ASSC reveals marked splenomegaly, with weights, reported up to 1870 grams 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The spleen in our patient weighed 1183 grams. Microscopic examination shows extensive pooling of red blood cells within the splenic cords with extensive sickling and numerous areas of necrosis and infarction as also seen in our patient. Supportive care with blood transfusion, intravenous fluids, oxygen and pain control can reduce the severity of the crisis. In cases with recurrent splenic sequestration crisis, splenectomy can be an option for those who achieve remission following the recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Splenectomy can also be considered in cases of double heterozygous sickle hemoglobinopathies with ASSC and suspicion for massive splenic infarction which fail to show clinical improvement following blood transfusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, as was the case in our patient.\n\n【26】In conclusion, this case highlights the wide variety of clinical phenotype encountered with S-β + thalassemia. Severe complications such as ASSC causing massive splenomegaly is rare in HbAS/B <sup>+ </sup> thalassemia, more so as an initial manifestation of the disease in an adult without any prior history or symptoms of anemia. A high index of suspicion should therefore be maintained in such clinical scenario to minimize unnecessary testing and ensure prompt and appropriate management.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【28】No conflict of interest reported by each author.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】No funding was obtained for this manuscript.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】No institutional review board (IRB) approval was needed.

Staphylococci and streptococci are the most common causative agents of infective endocarditis, with _Streptococcus gordonii_ being a rare cause. We present a case of infective endocarditis in a young patient who presented with an acute abdomen 2 months after being diagnosed with cerebrovascular accident. An abdominal computed tomography revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, and infarct in the right kidney and spleen as a result of systemic septic embolism. Echocardiography showed numerous vegetations at the aortic and mitral valves. Infective endocarditis was diagnosed based on echocardiographic findings and positive blood cultures for _S. gordonii_ . He was treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin and was also referred for surgical intervention.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Infective endocarditis is a potentially fatal condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Among the most common complications of infective endocarditis were heart failure, periannular abscess, systemic embolization, mycotic aneurysm and neurological complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Streptococci are the second most common cause of infective endocarditis after staphylococci. The viridans group streptococci (VGS) were found to be responsible for one-third of all streptococcal infective endocarditis cases, with _S. mitis_ group streptococci being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】_S. gordonii_ infection can cause infective endocarditis, septic arthritis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of _Streptococcus gordonii_ infective endocarditis complicated by systemic embolization to multiple sites.\n\n【6】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 28-year-old Bangladeshi man with no prior medical history initially presented with right-sided body weakness, and a brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed left middle cerebral artery infarct. Due to financial constraints, he was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 150 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. Two months later, he presented to our hospital with 3 days of generalized, colicky abdominal pain and 1 week of fever. He had no diarrhea, vomiting, recent abdominal trauma or surgical history.\n\n【8】His initial vital parameters revealed a blood pressure of 119/50 mm Hg and a temperature of 38.2°C. He was also tachycardic but saturating well in ambient air. On general examination, there was a collapsing pulse and finger clubbing, but no other signs of infective endocarditis. An oral examination revealed dental plaques but no caries. A thorough cardiovascular examination revealed the presence of an early diastolic murmur over the Erb’s point and a pansystolic murmur over the apical region radiating to the left axillary area. There were no signs of heart failure. A neurological examination revealed residual weakness in the right upper and lower limbs, with power of 4/5 compared to the left side. An abdominal examination revealed generalized tenderness throughout the abdomen, with the umbilical region being the most tender.\n\n【9】The initial full blood count revealed a white cell count of 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin of 8 g/dl, and normal platelet counts. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The chest and abdominal radiographs were normal. The patient was referred to the surgical team for an acute abdomen with a provisional diagnosis of perforated appendix. As a result, an urgent abdominal CT was performed, which revealed superior mesenteric artery thrombosis as well as right renal and splenic hypodense lesions, indicating infarction from septic emboli . There were no signs of a perforated appendix.\n\n【10】Figure 1\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Computed tomography of the abdomen showing (a) thrombosis at the distal part of the superior mesenteric artery, (b) a wedge-shaped hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen, (c) a hypodense lesion in the midpole of the right kidney.\n\n【13】An urgent echocardiography was scheduled due to the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. The ejection fraction was normal, with severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation and a bicuspid aortic valve as an incidental finding. Vegetations were discovered at the tips of the anterior and posterior aortic valves, measuring 1.1 cm × 0.6 cm and 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm, respectively. Another vegetation was discovered at the body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring 0.5 cm × 0.8 cm .\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Echocardiography showing vegetations at the aortic and mitral valves (anterior aortic valve = yellow arrow; posterior aortic valve = blue arrow; anterior mitral valve leaflet = green arrow).\n\n【17】He was diagnosed with infective endocarditis, which was complicated by septic embolization to multiple sites, including the brain, mesentery, kidney and spleen. Three sets of blood cultures were taken from three different sites at different times, and he was started on empirical antimicrobial treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. His condition improved after antibiotics, as his fever and abdominal pain subsided.\n\n【18】After two days of incubation, _S. gordonii_ was isolated from all blood cultures using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry method . The isolate was susceptible to penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.016 microgram/ml. He received benzylpenicillin 3 MU intravenously every 4 hours for a total of 6 weeks. He was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for surgical intervention due to the high risk of further septic embolization from multiple vegetations, the large size of vegetation (>1 cm), and previous systemic embolism. The patient was planned for surgical excision of the vegetations and valve reconstruction. He, however, decided to return to his home country for further treatment and valve surgery.\n\n【19】Figure 3\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Gram stain of the blood culture showing gram-positive cocci grouped in chains.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【23】VGS are catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci arranged in chains on microscopic examination. The VGS can be classified into six major groups, namely _Streptococcus anginosus_ group, _S. mitis_ group, _S. sanguinis_ group, _S. bovis_ group, _Streptococcus salivarius_ group, and _S. mutans_ group. The _S. sanguinis_ group is further divided into _S. sanguinis_ , _Streptococcus parasanguinis_ , and _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】_S. gordonii_ colonizes oral biofilms on tooth surfaces and is involved in the formation of dental plaques. Bacteria can be released from oral biofilms and enter the bloodstream via tooth brushing, tooth extraction or oral trauma, resulting in systemic infection. _S. gordonii_ bacteremia can cause platelet aggregation and hyperinflammatory state, which contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had no recent dental procedures. Nonetheless, dental plaques were discovered during a physical examination, which could be the source of _S. gordonii_ .\n\n【25】_S. gordonii_ is a rare causative agent of infective endocarditis. Mosailova _et al._ reported a 31-year-old man with mitral valve infective endocarditis caused by _S. gordonii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Besides that, Komorovsky _et al._ reported a case of _S. gordonii_ \\-related infective endocarditis in an 11-year-old girl with Barlow’s mitral valve disease in which _S. gordonii_ was cultured from the resected vegetation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Systemic embolism is a devastating and potentially fatal complication of infective endocarditis that occurs in up to 50% of cases. In patients with infective endocarditis, this is usually caused by fragmentation of vegetation or cardiac tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Millaire _et al._ reported that nearly half of patients with infective endocarditis developed systemic embolic complications, with the central nervous system being the most common, followed by the spleen, kidney, lung, liver, bone and joint, iliac artery, and mesenteric artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Infective endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-susceptible VGS, including _S. gordonii_ , can be treated with parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone. Gentamicin should be added for the first 2 weeks of penicillin treatment in patients with relatively penicillin-resistant VGS infective endocarditis. Early surgical intervention, in addition to targeted antimicrobial therapy, has been shown to reduce mortality and embolic events by lowering the risk of systemic embolism in patients with large vegetations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In conclusion, infective endocarditis should be considered in young patients who have stroke-like symptoms. _S. gordonii_ is a rare cause of infective endocarditis and is associated with dental plaques. Multiple, large-sized vegetations can predispose to systemic emboli, which must be treated promptly with antimicrobial therapy and early surgical intervention.\n\n【29】*   Abbreviations\n\n【30】*   VGS—Viridans group streptococci\n\n【31】*   CT—computed tomography\n\n【32】*   MALDI-TOF—matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight\n\n【33】*   MIC—minimum inhibitory concentration\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】None declared.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】Not required.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】Edmund LC Ong is the guarantor.\n\n【42】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【43】Not applicable.

The patient initially was treated for empyema with antibiotics but later represented to hospital with worsening symptoms. He underwent a surgical Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure and lung biopsy, which revealed a diagnosis of mesothelioma. The young age of the patient as well as absence of significant risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis unexpected. The patient had total body irradiation (TBI) therapy for leukaemia as a child, which increases the risk of developing cancer. However, there are limited studies exploring the risk of pleural mesothelioma post-TBI. Young patients who represent to hospital, with limited response to initial treatment, and suspicious radiological features should be considered for lung biopsy to reduce the risk of a missed diagnosis. Patients with a background of TBI should also be considered for follow-up to monitor for any subsequent malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Mesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the mesothelium, most commonly presenting in the pleura. In the UK, it accounted for 1% of all deaths between 2016 and 2018. Mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos fibre exposure, and patients often have a background of occupational exposure. Other non-asbestos mineral fibres and therapeutic radiation are less common risk factors for developing mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Almost 20% of patients diagnosed with mesothelioma have no prior history of asbestos exposure. There are other identified causes of mesothelioma including: erionite mineral fibre, carbon nanotubes, irradiation treatment, thorium dioxide, viruses including the avian leukosis virus and also chronic serosal inflammation, such as that seen in familial mediterranean fever and chronic empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The presentation of symptoms can be as long as 40 years from asbestos exposure and deaths in the UK from mesothelioma commonly occurred between the ages of 85 and 89 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】This case report discusses an atypical presentation of pleural mesothelioma in a young patient in his 30s with no significant risk factors and absence of asbestos tissue in the body. The report considers total body irradiation (TBI) therapy contributing towards the diagnosis of mesothelioma and the clinical manifestations in this young patient.\n\n【5】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【6】A 34-year-old male patient presented to hospital with a short history of persistent cough, shortness of breath and fever. The patient has a background of leukaemia as a child for which treatment included TBI. He also had thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a history of mental health issues. There is no family history of note. The patient reported having symptoms for three weeks prior to admission but no history of chest pain. On examination, he was noted to have reduced air entry on the left and was not clubbed. He was a non-smoker and there was no history of asbestos exposure. Blood results did not show raised inflammatory markers. The patient had a CT scan of the thorax which revealed marked pleural thickening with a left sided effusion . The patient refused pleural aspiration during this admission. The working diagnosis was empyema for which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient refused surgical intervention during this admission and his background of anxiety may have contributed to this decision. He was discharged with a prolonged course of oral antibiotics, with a view to early follow up.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】CT scan of the thorax that shows left sided pleural thickening. CT scan of the thorax.\n\n【10】Two months after his initial presentation to hospital, he was re-admitted due to worsening shortening of breath and chest pain. A repeat CT scan showed significant progression of his left sided pleural thickening with a new right sided effusion. Blood results again did not demonstrate a significant rise in infection markers. Microbiological and cytological analysis of pleural fluid did not reveal an obvious diagnosis .\n\n【11】Table 1\n\n【12】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【15】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\n【16】Open in new tab\n\n【17】Table 1\n\n【18】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n| Pleural/serum protein . | 37/60 g/L . |\n| --- | --- |\n| LDH | \\>1200 U/L |\n| pH | 7.269 |\n| Glucose | 1.7 mmol/L |\n| Microbiology and cytology | No organisms seen, no growth |\n\n【21】Results of aspiration of the left pleural fluid.\n\n【22】Open in new tab\n\n【23】With further counselling, he underwent a left Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure with pleural biopsy. The appearances were noted to be atypical for empyema as well as malignancy. There were post-inflammatory changes seen with a significantly thickened pleura, but no frank pus visible. Biopsies were taken from left lung parietal pleura, which confirmed an unexpected diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma T4 N1 M0 .\n\n【24】Figure 2\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】H&E x100—Parietal pleural tissue extensively infiltrated by epithelioid tumour cells forming cords, nests and tubular structures.

Sadly, the patient passed away 17 months after his initial presentation at the age of 35.\n\n【31】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【32】The young age of the patient along with the absence of significant asbestos-related risk factors for mesothelioma made the diagnosis of mesothelioma unexpected. Other factors should be explored which may have contributed to the development of mesothelioma.\n\n【33】The incidence of mesothelioma in those aged under 35 years old in the UK was 4 per 100 000, with the trend of incidence significantly increasing with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The young presentation of the patient without any known asbestos exposure would have suggested a low clinical suspicion of mesothelioma.\n\n【34】The patient underwent TBI therapy for the treatment of leukaemia during his childhood. The risk of developing cancer is increased after TBI. The latency of mesothelioma development after TBI was 29 years in our patient. The level of radiation along with age at which treatment was received can influence the clinical risk. A study looking at patients over a 45-year period found that higher dose radiation as well as treatment under the age of 20 significantly increased the risk of developing cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A further study also demonstrates that pulmonary toxicity increases after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】There is a difference in risk of secondary carcinogenesis between local radiation therapy and total body irradiation. A study looking at leukaemia in patients with cervical cancer who received local radiotherapy found that the risk of leukaemia increased two folds (RR = 2.0; 90% confidence interval = 1.0-4.2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The risk of malignant neoplasms increased by 2.8-fold after TBI (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval = 2.6-3.1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The study suggested lifelong monitoring for early detection of secondary carcinogenesis following TBI. There have been reported cases of peritoneal mesothelioma after TBI, however studies looking at reported cases of pleural mesothelioma are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The British childhood cancer survivor study that looked at outcomes of children diagnosed with cancer who may have received cancer treatment did not report any cases of pleural mesothelioma after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A systematic literature search has not shown any similar prior cases and, to the best of our knowledge, our case is the first of its kind.\n\n【36】The young age of onset of mesothelioma in this patient is an uncommon finding and the diagnosis could be missed or delayed in the clinical setting. In young patients diagnosed with clinical features of extensive pleural thickening, with a low suspicion of an infective aetiology, radiological investigation and subsequent biopsy should be considered early.

Morbidity and mortality most commonly occur secondary to pump failure or ventricular arrhythmias; however, a more infrequently seen complication is the formation of mural thrombi. More commonly seen within the left ventricle, thrombi can embolize leading to stroke or end organ infarction. We present the case of a male who presented with decompensated heart failure. The presence of biventricular thrombi was found on echocardiography and subsequent cross-sectional imaging revealed these had embolized resulting in the rare complication of extensive abdominal aortic thrombosis with renal and testicular infarction. Biventricular thrombi are rare but high risk due to the potential for embolization as demonstrated in this case. Prompt recognition and management with anti-coagulation are essential, followed by treatment of the underlying pathology, which resulted in the formation of thrombi to prevent recurrence.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Heart failure is an epidemic resulting in significant health care expenditure and morbidity for patients. Mural thrombus is a rare complication most commonly seen in the left ventricle (LV) following anterior myocardial infarction. Biventricular thrombi have been infrequently described; we present a case of biventricular thrombi resulting in extensive embolization and end organ infarction.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male smoker presented with exertional dyspnoea and scrotal swelling, without testicular pain, on a background of hypertension and excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was consistent with decompensated heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure, anasarca, peripheral and scrotal oedema.\n\n【6】Initial blood tests revealed an N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level of 27 594 pg/ml (<400 pg/ml) with deranged liver and renal biochemistry including an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 2266 u/l (<50 u/l) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 35 ml/min (>90 ml/min). Echocardiogram confirmed LV systolic impairment with an ejection fraction of 10%, moderately dilated LV and right ventricular (RV) cavities and severe functional mitral regurgitation. In addition, apical thromboses were present in the LV and RV .\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Transthoracic echocardiogram. ( **a** ) Focused RV view with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow). ( **b** ) Two-chamber view of the LV with thrombus visualized in the apex (arrow).\n\n【10】Given the presentation of gross peripheral oedema, scrotal oedema and deranged ALT, a post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude metastatic disease, specifically liver metastases. The CT study confirmed biventricular dilatation and apical thromboses . No evidence of malignancy or metastatic disease was demonstrated; however, important incidental findings included extensive occlusive abdominal aortic thrombus, which extended from the level of the superior mesenteric artery into the distal external iliac arteries where there was re-opacification of the vessels .\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】( **a** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT chest demonstrating biventricular apical thrombi (white arrow—RV thrombus, black arrow—left ventricular thrombus).

( **c** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the left kidney in keeping with infarction (Arrow). ( **d** ) Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen demonstrating reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally in keeping with infarction ( <sup>* </sup> ).\n\n【14】The left renal artery was completely occluded with reduced enhancement of the left kidney, consistent with infarction . The inferior mesenteric artery was also occluded at its origin although there was distal opacification and normal mucosal enhancement of the colon was preserved. In addition, there was reduced enhancement of the testes bilaterally with occlusion of the testicular arteries .\n\n【15】Given the history of excessive alcohol consumption, this was presumed to be the most likely aetiology of the patient’s heart failure which subsequently resulted in the formation of biventricular thrombi leading to embolic extensive aortic thrombosis. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was deemed unlikely given the absence of anginal symptoms or ischaemic electrocardiogram changes. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy would be an alternative differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation. An underlying thrombophilia such as anti-phospholipid syndrome accounting for the multiple sites of arterial thrombosis was considered; however, a thrombophilia screen was negative.\n\n【16】A multifaceted management approach to this patient initially included treatment of heart failure with intravenous furosemide infusion and commencement of ramipril. His heart failure medications were further optimized with the addition of eplerenone and ivabradine with good symptomatic benefit. The patient was strongly encouraged to cease further alcohol consumption.\n\n【17】With regards to the extensive aortic thrombosis, a surgical approach was deemed prohibitively high risk given the patient’s poor cardiac function. A percutaneous thrombectomy via the femoral approach was attempted but was unsuccessful, and therefore the patient was managed conservatively with a heparin infusion and subsequently converted to warfarin.\n\n【18】Serum testosterone levels were found to be low at 1.3 nmol/L (7–26 nmol/L) due to testicular infarction, and therefore replacement was commenced. Following improvement in symptoms and renal and liver biochemistry, the patient was discharged on oral diuretics and long-term warfarin therapy with an INR target of 2–3 in keeping with guideline recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Follow-up.\n\nThe patient developed sepsis |$\\\\sim$| 2 months following the initial presentation, from the right femoral access site which was persistently discharging following the previous attempt at femoral thrombectomy. A post-contrast CT chest, abdomen and pelvis study was performed to exclude other potential sources of sepsis, confirmed a right groin collection. There was persistent extensive aortic occlusive thrombus as seen previously; however, there was evidence of new collateralization from rectus abdominis and paraspinal arteries filling the external iliac and femoral arteries. The biventricular thrombi had resolved and there was no evidence of propagation of the aortic thrombus or new arterial thrombosis.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【22】The formation of LV thrombus in the context of cardiomyopathy with LV impairment and reduced ejection fraction is well-documented; however, biventricular thrombosis is a rarer occurrence complicating up to 23.9% of LV thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Biventricular thrombi have been previously reported in the literature complicating acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>. The proposed mechanism for ventricular thrombus formation in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy, as in this case, is blood stasis secondary to cavity dilatation and hypokinesis. A hypercoagulable state can also predispose to the formation of biventricular thrombi including conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. A thrombophilia screen should therefore be performed as part of the investigation for biventricular thrombi.\n\n【23】Complications of biventricular thrombi include systemic and pulmonary embolization which can result in significant end-organ damage such as pulmonary emboli, stroke, acute limb ischaemia and visceral ischaemia. Contemporary data suggest an annualized embolism rate of 3.7% despite treatment with anti-coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Ventricular thrombi complicated by such extensive aortic thrombus have not previously been reported in the literature to our knowledge. There was evidence of end-organ damage with left renal infarct and bilateral testicular infarcts. No pulmonary emboli were demonstrated in this case.\n\n【24】A high index of suspicion is required when predisposing factors for the formation of ventricular thrombi exist such as apical hypokinesia particularly following a large anterior myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial investigation of choice and has 35–60% sensitivity and 90% specificity for LV thrombus detection. Although CT has similar detection rates to TTE, delayed enhancement cardiac MRI is the gold standard for LV thrombus detection with 88% sensitivity and 99% specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】There are no guideline recommendations for the treatment of biventricular thrombus. In practice, patients are treated with low molecular weight heparin before being established on oral anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only approved oral anticoagulant for LV thrombus; however, emerging evidence suggests direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in selected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for up to 6 months for treatment of LV thrombus, with duration guided by surveillance TTE and consideration of bleeding risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thrombolysis remains a treatment option, however carries a risk of catastrophic embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thrombectomy should be considered in patients with a larger, more mobile thrombi which carry an increased risk of embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Conservative management in the present case with warfarin resulted in the resolution of ventricular thrombi; however, due to persisting aortic thrombus, the decision was made to continue long-term anti-coagulation.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【28】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】There were no sources of funding associated with this case report.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】No ethical approval was required for this case report.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】Written patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.\n\n【35】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【36】Dr Saad Ezad.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The causative lesion is located in the thalamocortical projections, thalamus or brainstem and is usually due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. We report a case of a patient with brain stem cavernous malformations presented as pure COPS with additional sensory disturbance in the thorax. We report this case to raise awareness of these very rare syndromes and demonstrate that mildly presenting symptoms can be caused by an underlying devastating condition.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cavernous malformations (CMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels lined with endothelial cells that do not exhibit intervening tight junctions, lack muscular and elastic layers and are filled with blood at varying degrees of thrombosis. The incidence of cerebral CMs ranges from 0.4 to 0.8%; they comprise 10–15% of all vascular malformations in the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. CMs present in a sporadic typically single-lesion form and a familial form, which usually has multiple lesions, comprises 30–50% of cases, and are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in one of the _CCM1_ , _CCM2_ or _CCM3_ genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patients with brainstem CMs can present with a broad range of symptoms including cranial nerve deficit, hemiparesis and hemisensory loss, but asymptomatic lesions are found in 20–50% of all CMs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of brainstem CMs presented with pure cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome (COPS).\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 56-year-old man presented with an abnormal tingling sensation around the right side corner of the mouth, and in the hand, foot and lateral thoracic region . He had a history of dyslipidemia and anxiety disorder, for which he was taking simvastatin and escitalopram. His body temperature was 36.7°C, his pulse was 90 bpm, and his blood pressure was 128/86 mmHg. Neurologic examination revealed that the patient was alert, his cranial nerves were intact, his motor power was grade V in all extremities, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal. Objective sensory deficit was not seen. We suspected COPS with additional thorax involvement. COPS is usually due to a lesion in the thalamocortical projections or thalamus and brainstem. The differential diagnosis of COPS in this patient included lacunar infarction because he had a risk factor for dyslipidemia, hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral vascular malformations such as CMs, and arteriovenous malformations were also possible differential diagnosis.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】The patient had paresthesia around the corner of the right side of the mouth, and in the hand, foot and lateral thoracic region of the same side.\n\n【9】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined lesion in the left side of the dorsal pons, measuring 1.2 × 1.1 cm and showing T1 hyperintensity without enhancement, T2 hyperintensity with a hemosiderin rim and surrounding edema, and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and was diagnosed with a bleeding CM . Because his symptoms did not disturb his quality of life and the lesion was located in the deep pons, where the morbidity associated with the intervention is high. Observation was considered and gabapentin was prescribed at 300 mg/day. His sensory symptom was gradually decreased, and he had only mild tingling sensation with no additional symptoms after the 16-week follow-up period.\n\n【10】**Figure 2**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】MRI.

COPS was first described in patients with midbrain and pontine hemorrhagic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A further report documented unilateral sensory disturbances in the thoracic region, in addition to the hand, mouth and foot regions due to lesions in the thalamus and thalamocortical projections; additional symptoms included headache, diplopia and/or hemiparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with very rare COPS with thoracic region involvement without additional symptoms. COPS could be explained by partial involvement of the medial lemniscus, thalamus or thalamocortical projections. In the medial lemniscus in the pons, the closeness of the sensory fibers from the head, arm, trunk and leg can be explained by COPS with thoracic involvement in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient was high risk of misdiagnosis because he presented with unfamiliar sensory symptoms without other abnormal symptoms along with a history of anxiety disorder.\n\n【15】Brainstem CMs account for 20–35% of all CMs and have higher incidence rates of hemorrhaging and re-hemorrhaging than non-brainstem CMs (2.8 vs. 0.3%, and 32.3% vs. 6.3% per patient-year, respectively) and a low mortality rate of 2.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The risk factors of CMs hemorrhaging include young age, female sex, prior hemorrhage and a deep location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice, especially SWI sequences and gradient echo sequences that demonstrate the area of prior hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Brain MRI of our patient showed hyperintensities on both T1-and T2 weighted sequences and an associated blooming susceptibility artifact on SWI sequence due to their subacute hemorrhage.\n\n【17】Management options include observation or surgery: surgical resection, radiosurgery or stereotactic laser ablation. Observation may be preferred despite a lesion being symptomatic if the intervention risk is high, such as with deeply located CMs. Postoperative brainstem CMs morbidity occurred in 34.8% including motor deficits, sensory deficits, tracheostomy/gastrostomy requirement and other cranial nerve deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. If repeated hemorrhages lead to progressive neurological morbidity, surgery may be considered. In our patient, observation was considered because he had only sensory symptoms. and the lesion was located in the deep pons, where the morbidity associated with the intervention is high.\n\n【18】We report this case of brainstem CMs presented with isolated COPS with additional thorax involvement to raise awareness of these very rare syndromes. We consider COPS an underreported condition because the mild sensory symptoms can be easily misdiagnosed by a physician, and the patients may not be concerned about their symptoms, which are linked to serious conditions. The occurrence of COPS as a presentation of neurological disease should be investigated in neurological patients, especially stroke patients, to raise awareness and prevent misdiagnosis of serious conditions.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【20】Not applicable.\n\n【21】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【22】None declared.\n\n【23】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【24】This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【25】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【26】This study was approved by the Prapokklao Hospital Ethics Committee.

The patient’s growing weakening, manifested as muscular atrophy, hyperreflexia, fasciculations and muscle cramps, is the most striking feature of the disease. However, the sensory function remains unaffected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We describe a case of ALS presenting bulbar onset with neurodegeneration, dysarthria and dysphagia.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 73-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension arrived at our neurology clinic complaining of speech difficulties and voice changes that had been going on for ⁓4 months. During the assessment, the patient displayed dysarthria and slurred speech. She had trouble swallowing both liquid and solid food and was constantly drooling. Her respiratory function was preserved. Upon examination, the patient displayed tongue fasciculations that were more noticeable on the left lateral side. The left hemibody showed more signs of atrophy in the thenar and hypothenar eminences, and the interosseous muscles of the hands. The biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris muscles both had clear fasciculations. The patient had a broad decline in muscle strength that scored 4/5 in the right hemibody and 3/5 in the left. The clinical examination revealed enhanced osteotendinous reflexes in the four limbs. The bilateral palmomental reflex was more pronounced on the left side. The patient also presented a snout reflex. In the left hemibody, Hoffman, Babinski and more obvious bilateral clonus were found. On pharyngeal examination, the gag reflex was not elicited, the left side palate was slightly dropped and the uvula showed deviation to the right. The differential and erythrocyte sedimentation rates on the hemogram were unaltered. Creatine phosphatase (CPK) measured 380 U/I. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) scans of the skull and spine revealed no abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord. Fibrillations, positive sharp waves and fasciculations were detected spontaneously by electromyography in the investigated muscles (biceps, pronator teres, spinal cord and tibialis anterior). The notching and enhanced polyphasic amplitude of the motor unit potentials were visible.\n\n【6】In the differential diagnosis, entities that affected the first and second motor neurons were assessed from compressive causes in the stem and spinal cord, intoxications, demyelinating diseases and primary lateral sclerosis. Cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF) showed an albumin-cytological dissociation with a protein of 151 mg/dl and the cell count of 2/mm <sup>3 </sup> . CSF oligoclonal band study was negative. Acetyl cholinesterase receptor antibodies and anti-muscle specific kinase antibodies were negative, ruling out the possibility of myasthenia gravis. The serological testing of cytomegalovirus using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) classes was negative. Thus diagnosis of bulbar onset ALS was made based on clinical, serological, CSF and electophysiological findings. The patient was put on symptomatic and supportive treatment with neuroprotective agents: Riluzol, Vitamin E and co-enzyme Q10. General measures were provided with gentle rehabilitation, amantadine and psychological support. At follow up visits, the patient had shown rapid functional deterioration and decline in life quality.\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】ALS, referred to as classic MND, impacts motor neurons on both the upper and lower limbs. Typical bulbar onset ALS patients develop progressive limb symptoms within first 6 months. Patients with a duration of >20 months from bulbar onset to first significant limb involvement are more likely to have isolated bulbar palsy (IBP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with bulbar onset ALS had poor prognosis and the disease course and survival time was significantly shorter. Early signs of bulbar onset ALS typically include bulbar muscles. Individuals gradually lose their strength, ability to speak, eat, move and even breathe, and practically all of the muscles they can control voluntarily become afflicted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Within 2–3 years for cases of bulbar onset ALS and 3–5 years for patients with limb onset ALS, the paralysis progresses and results in death due to respiratory failure. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 55 and 75, while the disease can strike at any age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The patient in this case had both lower motor neuron (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) bulbar signs. While Karam et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> found no evidence of a significant difference between UMN and LMN bulbar signs between the two groups, Burrel _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> discovered that UMN bulbar signs were more prevalent in IBP.\n\n【10】ALS presents with significant clinical heterogeneity. The most common causes of diagnostic delays in ALS are frequent referrals to specialists, misdiagnosis, the location of disease onset, age at which it first manifests and comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The trait of female gender predominance in bulbar onset ALS suggests that genetic factors may be involved. Most ALS cases have been described as sporadic, and more research on the pathophysiology and genetic susceptibility of ALS is required.\n\n【11】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【12】None.\n\n【13】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【14】There is no conflict of interest.\n\n【15】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【16】None.\n\n【17】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【18】All the available data has been presented in the manuscript.\n\n【19】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【20】Not applicable.\n\n【21】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【22】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of the manuscript.\n\n【23】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【24】Ajay Singh.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The patient was presumed to be adherent on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and was initiated on respective treatments for the opportunistic infections but continued to deteriorate. On further reviewing, he was found to be poorly adherent to ART and was advised enhanced adherence counselling after which his condition improved. We report this case to emphasize the importance of adherence to ART medications in the management of patients with HIV.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have high morbidity and mortality owing to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Early diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of management in patients with advanced HIV. Although a lot of stress is laid on the initiation of therapy, monitoring of compliance and importance of adherence in management is often neglected. We present a case of advanced HIV with multiple opportunistic infections to emphasize that adherence to ART is the most effective tool in managing patients with advanced HIV, and poor treatment adherence is associated with adverse outcomes.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old gentleman who worked in the para-military forces presented to a secondary care hospital with intermittent high-grade fever associated with loss of appetite and weight (around 10 kg) for a year. He was found to be positive for HIV-1 infection and was advised ART. He did not initiate ART and presented 2 months later to us with fever, shortness of breath and loose stools for 15 days. He was found to have a CD4 count of 62/mcl. A chest X-ray and computed tomography of the chest was done for these complaints, which was suggestive of _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia. He was managed in the intensive care unit with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and steroids. After 2 days of initiation of treatment, he developed erythema over forearm, neck, chest and extremities. This was accompanied by oral mucosal involvement and punctate keratopathy. He was diagnosed as Steven Johnson syndrome-toxic epidemo-necrolysis overlap secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was immediately stopped, and he was put on steroids. His lesions resolved in next 2 weeks and he was started on tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz along with dapsone prophylaxis. ART was not started earlier as both tenofovir and efavirenz could have worsened the skin condition. He was discharged in a stable condition. He reported proper compliance in all his out-patient visits. Eighteen months into the illness, he started to have dysphagia and small bowel type of diarrhoea (15–20 times/day, non-bloody, not associated with abdominal pain and tenesmus) for which he was admitted. On upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, he was found to have oesophagal candidiasis and was started on fluconazole. Stool microscopy revealed _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts, and he was initiated on nitazoxanide. However, he continued to have diarrhoea with multiple stool samples detecting _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts and had persistent dyselectrolytemia for which oral supplementation was given. He continued to deteriorate and was found to have features of dehydration, severe wasting, candidiasis (oral) and diffuse ichthyosis on examination. Dosage of nitazoxanide was increased, and azithromycin was added once daily for cryptosporidiosis to which he responded partially.\n\n【6】His CD4 count was zero, and viral load was high. His previous CD4 counts done at six-monthly intervals after the baseline count of CD4 of 62/mcl were 104/mcl and 76/mcl. With suspicion of failure, he was started on zidovudine, lamivudine and atazanavir/ritonavir. Single-tablet regimen with a protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitor was not available under the national scheme for use in this patient. HIV resistance genotyping did not detect any resistance to any of the tested drugs. On reviewing the history, he reported decreased adherence to the ART medications as he avoided taking his medications in front of his co-workers on outstation postings. He also seemed to be extremely worried about his ill health. He was counselled about the severity of his condition and the importance of adherence. He was referred to a trained psychologist for evaluation. He was found to be depressed and was started on anti-depressant by the psychiatrist. He was continued on a PI-based therapy, owing to its higher barrier to resistance, considering his history of non-compliance.\n\n【7】He continued to have persistent diarrhoea along with dysphagia not responding to fluconazole. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis was suspected in addition to candidiasis based on raised CMV viral load and UGI endoscopy findings. He was started on valganciclovir after which his CMV viral load became negative. His diarrhoea and dysphagia eventually improved and was discharged on PI-based ART, dapsone prophylaxis and fluconazole. He was also registered for regular follow-up with the psychologist and psychiatrist.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【9】Cryptosporidiosis is commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV with an overall prevalence of 8.7%. These patients present with a diarrheal illness which may last for months resulting in weight loss, malnutrition and extended hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although nitazoxanide is approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, it is often ineffective. Other agents like azithromycin and PIs have been tried with minimal success. Effective ART is probably the most effective tool in managing patients with cryptosporidiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】CMV infection is associated with rapid HIV disease progression and consequently, more acquired immune deficiency syndrome related events. ART is not only effective in controlling HIV replication but also decreases CMV-related adverse events by the restoration of CMV-specific immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. CMV-related gastrointestinal disease is seen in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression. Oesophagus and colon are the most important sites that are affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ganciclovir/valganciclovir, along with the initiation of effective ART, is the treatment of choice.\n\n【11】India has a total of >2 million HIV-positive individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most of these patients are managed in ART centres linked to the national programme. The national programme was initiated in 1992, and it has been giving free ART to all HIV registered HIV patients since 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The programme continues to give free ART to all the registered patients despite the decrease in its funding. The national programme has tried to keep up with the recommendations on the treatment given by the World Health Organisation. Since 2013, the first-line treatment has been a single-tablet regimen of tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For those who fail the first-line treatment, they are shifted to a two-pill regimen containing atazanavir/ritonavir. While the programme works fairly well for most patients, in this patient, there were certain challenges. At the time, the patient presented routine viral load monitoring was not available for all patients at the centre. It was done only for those patients where immunological failure was suspected. Despite access to free ART, the number of centres that dispense medications is limited, leading to high patient turn over in each centre. Due to the high patient turn, the time spent with each patient is suboptimal, leading to a poor patient–physician relationship. Also, adherence is measured by pill counting method and therefore, it is easy to miss non-compliance. Single-tablet regimen with dolutegravir has been recently introduced in the national scheme, but it was not available at the time, the patient was being managed.\n\n【12】Variable drug adherence was noted (47–90%) in the studies from Indian centres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The problem of drug adherence is further compounded by high pill burden, poor health literacy and treatment-related side effects in patients with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART is associated with inadequate viral suppression, increased resistance and increased opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. It is essential to spend time with the patient and understand his/her problems during the initiation of ART. Patients are often scared of revealing their medical condition to their employers for fear of being judged and losing their job. It is also essential to empowering the patient about their rights 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Poor treatment adherence to ART, due to various socio-economic factors, is often missed by healthcare staffs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It is imperative to consider the social aspects like living conditions, economic support, working conditions and family support.\n\n【13】Potential solutions to improve adherence include better education and motivation of patients, early referral for diagnosis and treatment, home visits, an increase in human resources and, creating social support groups. Patient education programmes are essential not only in the hospital but also in the communities near patients’ residence. This would help to dispel the misconceptions and stigma associated with HIV infection. Adherence counselling, although a time-consuming process is an advantageous intervention in terms of overall patient outcome.\n\n【14】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【15】Nil.\n\n【16】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【17】None declared.\n\n【18】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【19】None to declare.\n\n【20】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【21】Not applicable.\n\n【22】Consent was taken prior to publications.\n\n【23】Guarantor—same as the corresponding author.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5ffa2684-933c-4bf8-b0dd-f43b0eb3a316", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】Actinomycosis is a rare bacterial infection with a broad clinical presentation that is seldom reported after elective cholecystectomy. We present an as-of-yet unreported case of actinomycosis in an 81-year-old gentleman who was found to have right-sided peritonitis and small bowel obstruction 11 months after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A complex loculated lesion was found on laparotomy with a protracted course of antibiotics being needed for treatment. The rarity of this condition will mean it remains a surprise diagnosis to many clinicians. However, it is important that clinicians maintain some index of suspicion to prevent unnecessary surgery and are aware of the protracted course of antibiotics that is needed for successful treatment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Actinomycosis refers to a progressive suppurative and granulomatous disease process attributed to a member of the actinomyces family; of which, _Actinomyces israelii_ is the most common causative organism. These microaerophilic bacteria are usually contained within the gastrointestinal, oral and genitourinary tracts, although if the mucosa is breached they can give rise to pathology. The common sites for infection are cervico-facial (60%), abdomen (20%) and pelvis (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, with a subacute to chronic infective course possibly due to the relapsing and remitting nature of actinomycosis. As a result, it can take many years for actinomycosis to present clinically.\n\n【4】To further complicate the clinical features of abdominal actinomycosis, any organ within the abdomen can be affected as tissue planes can be crossed and fistulae or sinuses formed. Unsurprisingly, actinomycosis has been confused with tumours, inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, diverticular disease and peri-anal pathology. Various case reports reflect on pseudotumour-like syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, intra-abdominal collections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and varying degrees of peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This has led to actinomycosis being described as ‘a master of disguise’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】There have also been reports of iatrogenic actinomycosis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6–8 \\]</u>. These case series all report biliary spillage, a lost stone or a gangrenous gall bladder at the time of surgery. Nevertheless, although such spillage is a relatively common intraoperative occurrence, progression to actinomycosis is rare. We present an as-of-yet unreported but life-threatening presentation of actinomycosis peritonitis in a patient with a recent history of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 81-year-old male was admitted to hospital with a 1-day history of faeculent vomiting and a 3-week history of a change in his bowel habit. He also described right-sided rib and hip pain, which required opiate analgesia prescribed by his general practitioner. On direct questioning, he admitted two stones of unintentional weight loss. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation (on warfarin) and hypertension. He had undergone an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy 11 months earlier for gallstone disease. At the time of surgery, there was minimal bile and stone debris spillage, which was nevertheless thoroughly irrigated and washed out.\n\n【8】On this admission, he was apyrexial, normotensive and normocardiac. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension with generalized abdominal pain and right flank/right upper quadrant peritonitis. Bowel sounds were absent, and rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. Laboratory testing revealed a high leucocyte count of 22.7 (10 <sup>9 </sup> /l) and a C-reactive protein of 290 (mg/l). Plane abdominal and chest radiographs showed dilated loops of proximal small bowel and faecal loading; however, no evidence of pneumoperitoneum was present. A subsequent abdominal CT scan confirmed this pattern of bowel dilatation and while no clear cut-off point was visible, a right sub-hepatic multiloculated collection extending down the right lateral abdominal was seen . Generalized pneumobilia was also noted .\n\n【9】Figure 1:\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】A complex and loculated collection almost surrounding the liver and tracking down the right paracolic gutter. Faecal loading is also noted.\n\n【12】Figure 2:\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Peri-hepatic fluid is shown with marked pneumobilia present.\n\n【15】With both the clinical and radiographic pictures pointing towards small bowel obstruction in the presence of a collection, perforation, ischaemia and underlying tumour were all possible differential diagnoses despite the CT findings. Due to the clinical uncertainty and the presence of obstruction, it was felt that the patient should undergo emergency laparotomy rather than percutaneous drainage of the collection to help identify and rectify the underlying pathology and relieve the obstruction. However, during the procedure, no perforation was found. The large purulent right upper quadrant collection was identified. Pus was aspirated and sent for microbiological culture, but was not examined for sulphur granules nor retained for subsequent examination. No other gross pathology was found, and a thorough abdominal lavage was performed. His postoperative improvement was slow and complicated by significant sepsis requiring intensive care admission for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and inotropic support. Eight days later, _A. israelii_ was isolated , and under microbiological guidance, treatment with tazobactam and piperacillin (Tazocin™) 4.5 g three times daily was continued.\n\n【16】Figure 3:\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Image of the species of _A. israelii_ grown.\n\n【19】After completing a 2-week course, he was discharged home with a further 2-week course of intravenous Tazocin, followed by oral penicillin. Routine blood testing by the general practitioner showed persistently raised inflammatory markers. A repeat ultrasound scan of the abdomen at 8 weeks post discharge revealed a collection of extra-luminal fluid adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall measuring 8 × 9 × 7 cm. This was drained under ultrasound guidance, and the patient commenced on a further 3-month course of oral penicillin after which he made a full recovery.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】Intra-abdominal actinomycosis is a rare complication of abdominal surgery with a variety of presentations from subacute infection to florid peritonitis with obstruction. The period between insult and presentation can vary from 1 to 11 years due to its low virulence potential and a relapsing–remitting course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Yet it is not just the rarity of actinomycosis that complicates its diagnosis. The presenting symptoms are usually non-specific including pain, malaise, fever, weight loss and the pressure effect of the granuloma on adjacent structures. Even when the disease process is identified, culture of Actinomyces is negative in up to 76% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The precipitating causes described in the literature are also broad, and include appendicitis, diverticulitis, intestinal perforation, trauma, bowel infarction, haemorrhage, cholecystitis, use of interuterine devices and bowel surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The severity of infective sequelae means that clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion for two reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention, although preoperative microbiological culture may not be possible. Secondly, without prolonged and specific antibiotic treatment, relapse can occur causing further morbidity and mortality. Suggested treatment regimens include surgical drainage and removal of affected tissue, with a 6- to 12-month course of high-dose penicillin.\n\n【23】In summary, although both perforation causing sepsis and pseudotumour-like obstruction are recognized in the literature, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first account of bowel obstruction caused by intra-abdominal sepsis in the absence of perforation. We feel that the most likely source of sepsis was either bile or stone fragment spillage, or transposition of bacteria while the gallbladder was inflamed. The rarity of actinomycosis means it will continue to be a surprise diagnosis in a majority of cases.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【25】None declared\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【27】We would like to thank Dr Mark Alexander, Consultant Radiologist, Department of Radiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital and also Dr Rohinton Mulla, Consultant Microbiologist, Department of Microbiology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Current British Society of Rheumatology advice is to stop TCZ 3-months pre-conception. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with extensive TA treated with TCZ, azathioprine and glucocorticoids in pregnancy. She was closely monitored with MDT input and TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy as the benefits were thought to outweigh the risks. Our case also highlights the importance of accurate blood pressure monitoring in an appropriate anatomical location, given the extent of her disease. Our patient’s disease remained stable throughout the antenatal and post-partum period with a successful pregnancy outcome and no maternal or foetal complications. TCZ is suitable for select cases of refractory TA during pregnancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) is a large vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology. Glucocorticoid therapy is a mainstay of treatment. More recently, tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, has been approved in resistant or refractory disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Because of the limited data in pregnancy, current British Society of Rheumatology guidance is to stop TCZ 3 months prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】### CASE REPORT\n\n【5】We report a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian lady (Gravida 2, Para 1) with TA treated with TCZ throughout pregnancy at a tertiary specialist Foetal and Maternal Medicine—Rheumatology combined clinic.\n\n【6】The patient gave a 4-year history of daily headache with photophobia diagnosed previously as migraine. In January 2017, she presented with 3 days of malaise with typical headache and right sided upper limb aching with incoordination. The following day she presented with repeated 10-min episodes of left facial and upper limb weakness and word-finding difficulties. She was reviewed by neurology team and her workup suggested a right carotid territory dissection with parietal cortex involvement on MR imaging; however, MR angiography revealed widespread large vessel vasculitis with proximal right brachiocephalic, right common carotid artery, left carotid artery origin and left Subclavian involvement . Given the findings she was diagnosed with TA.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Comparison of the MR angiographic findings between January 2017 (Image 1) and December 2018 (Image 2). The arteries are labelled numerically as follows: brachiocephalic artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>, initially stenosed, subsequently progressed with occlusion from aortic arch to the vertebral artery origin. Right common carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> was severely narrowed with only a trickle flow proximally and occluded up to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the right internal carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> is severely narrowed initially and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan. Right vertebral artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> was initially severely attenuated, with only a trickle flow, and shows reconstitution on subsequent scan and appeared almost normal. Left common carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> was initially severely narrowed over a short segment from the aortic arch origin becomes occluded from the arch to the carotid bifurcation, whereas the left internal carotid artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>, initially normal, subsequently shows moderately severe narrowing in the neck. The left subclavian artery has a short segment of severe stenosis, which had progressed slightly, whereas the distal subclavian artery narrowing in the supraclavicular fossa had resolved. Left vertebral artery 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> is dominant and was not affected initially, and becomes hypertrophic on subsequent scan.\n\n【10】Initial treatment was with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1 gram and IV cyclophosphamide. IV methylprednisolone was given for 5 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisolone. The inflammatory markers improved but had not normalized. Following the seventh course of cyclophosphamide, she had a left middle cerebral artery embolic event in late 2017. Angiogram showed progression of the disease in the major arteries of the neck . Because of refractory disease, her treatment was changed to subcutaneous TCZ (162 mg weekly), azathioprine and a weaning dose of prednisolone (25 mg). Azathioprine was started at 50 mg daily and escalated to 100 mg. She conceived on this combination and was assessed first time in our combined Rheumatology/Obstetrics clinic at 14 weeks gestation (March 2019). She had no other co-morbidities and was a non-smoker. Baseline blood pressure (BP) in her thigh was 130/84 mmHg and 90/68 and 67/53 mmHg in her left and right arms, respectively. Her Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS) at first pregnancy visit was 0 (scored retrospectively by INB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and her CRP was 5 mg/l (normal < 5.0). Given her extensive disease and previous life-threatening complications and following detailed discussion with the patient and her partner, a decision to continue TCZ was made, with close monitoring and multi-disciplinary support. A steroid-taper of 5 mg every 4 weeks was initiated, and she was started on aspirin 150 mg at night and tinzaparin 4500 IU daily.\n\n【11】BP monitoring used her thigh or calf and at 22 weeks, amlodipine 5 mg daily was added as her BP was 170/70 mmHg. Ultrasound assessments of placental function were performed at 17 and 22 weeks. There was normal foetal growth and both uterine artery dopplers demonstrated normal resistance waveforms. Because of risk of pre-eclampsia urine protein ratio was check at each clinic visit and this remained within normal range (0–30 mg/mmol).\n\n【12】Prednisolone was further tapered to 7.5 mg daily by 34 weeks and maintained through the rest of her pregnancy. Systemically, she had no TA flares; at her 34-week visit her ITAS score remained 0 and her CRP was <1.0 mg/L. There were concerns over the risks of vaginal delivery, and an elective caesarean section (CS) was planned at 39 weeks gestation. However, spontaneous labour occurred 2 days before her scheduled admission date and she had an emergency CS. She delivered a baby girl weighing 2768 grams with no peri-partum maternal or foetal complications. TCZ and azathioprine were withheld during the peri-partum period for 2–3 weeks until her CS wound healed and she had IV hydrocortisone 25 mg three times daily for 48 h and then prednisolone was continued at 7.5 mg daily.\n\n【13】Few months later 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>, she underwent MRA brain and carotid to assess disease status. Imaging was discussed at neuroradiology multidisciplinary team meeting; the stenotic lesion remained stable and there were no radiographic features to suggest disease progression.\n\n【14】Subsequently she has been maintained on TCZ and AZA and her prednisolone was tapered to 5 and 7.5 mg alternate days. More recent imaging 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u> confirms disease stability. At the time of reporting, her baby is 40 months old and is healthy.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Relapsing, resistant TA poses significant challenges during pregnancy. Whilst biologics are discontinued prior to pregnancy or early in the first trimester; uncontrolled or flaring disease can put both the mother and foetus at risk of complications such as worsening hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity and/or intra-uterine growth restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. High-dose glucocorticoids also contribute to BP dysregulation and impaired glucose tolerance, thus adding to overall pregnancy risks.\n\n【17】TCZ provides good disease control and is steroid sparing. No relevant placental transfer of IgG1 occurs in the first trimester; however, transfer can increasingly occur through the second and third trimesters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Current guidelines suggest stopping TCZ 3 months prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Data regarding TCZ safety in pregnancy are mainly from RA patients. One case series of prenatal or early first trimester exposure to TCZ found that in 180 prospective and 108 retrospective cases there was no substantial increase in the rate of congenital malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The rate of spontaneous abortion (21%) was similar to the general population (10–20%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A retrospective analysis of 61 Japanese RA patients on TCZ found that the rate of spontaneous abortion (18%), congenital abnormalities (none) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (10%) were similar to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this study, only one patient continued TCZ throughout pregnancy and delivered a baby with a low birth weight (<2000 g).\n\n【19】We found two cases of patients taking TCZ in pregnancy for TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. As with our case, both had refractory disease with extensive damage. TCZ was continued throughout pregnancy in one patient and stopped at 6 weeks gestation in the other. Pregnancy outcomes were favourable apart from one case developing neonatal jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】More recently TCZ has been widely used for the management of severe COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ten pregnant patients were included in trial; however, no specific maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted. In another retrospective study of 12 pregnant women with COVID-19 receiving TCZ, all pregnancies resulted in live births, there were two reports of transient hepatotoxicity and one of cytomegalovirus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. To gain further understanding and effect of immunomodulators on pregnancy and neonatal outcome, a more robust regulatory structure for recruiting pregnant patient in clinical trial is warranted.\n\n【21】Our case had aggressive TA and since the benefits of continuing TCZ to maintain stable disease outweighed the theoretical risks, TCZ was continued through pregnancy with a successful outcome. This case also highlights the need for accurate monitoring BP in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. In selected cases, TCZ therefore has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy.\n\n【22】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【23】In selected cases, TCZ has a role in managing refractory TA in pregnancy. It is pertinent to monitor BP accurately in an appropriate anatomical location guided by angiographic findings. Our case report also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary team role in managing such complex cases.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】No specific funding was received from any bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】No approval required.\n\n【28】CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n-----------------------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Capillary Blood Glucose was 29 mmol/L. HbA1c was 133 mmol/L. Non-contrast computerised tomography (CT) scan of the brain was normal suggesting that the cause of her seizure was hyperglycaemia. However, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed infarcts in the left paracentral lobule and caudate nucleus. It also identified loss of signal flow void in the intracranial segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) raising the suspicion for thrombosis secondary to dissection. This was later confirmed on CT angiogram. This case demonstrates how the initial CT Head was non-diagnostic. We stress the importance of taking a careful seizure history and subsequently obtaining an MRI scan to fully exclude structural pathology.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】The annual incidence of carotid artery dissection is approximately 2.5–3 per 100 000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Causes are either traumatic or atraumatic. Presentation can include seizures, headaches or even focal neurological deficits which can become permanent due to prolonged ischaemia causing cerebral infarcts. We report the case of a 36-year-old Type 2 diabetic woman, initially thought to have had a hyperglycaemic seizure, who instead had cerebral infarcts secondary to a left ICA dissection which was likely the true cause of her seizure. We stress the importance of taking a careful history of the seizure and we caution against the reliance on a CT scan to exclude structural pathology.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a witnessed seizure which resulted in loss of consciousness. In particular, she described shaking of the right hand which progressed sequentially to involve the right arm and then the right leg. She then lost consciousness for approximately 2–3 minutes after which she regained consciousness but remained drowsy. In the preceding 48 hours, she reported that she had two episodes of shaking in her right hand. These lasted approximately 2–3 minutes and resolved spontaneously. She had no previous seizure history. On examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15 and she had no neurological deficits as a result of the seizure. She had a 21 year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus which was managed with oral hypoglycaemic drugs. She had no other significant medical history. Her capillary blood glucose level was 29 mmol/L and her HbA1c level was 133 mmol/L. Her HbA1c had ranged between 114 and 144 mmol/L over the last 6 years indicating poor glycaemic control. Her remaining blood tests were normal. Apart from the patient’s ethnicity (South East Asian) and diabetic status there were no other cardiovascular risk factors for a stroke. A non-contrast CT scan of her brain was normal. A lumbar puncture ruled out intracranial infection as it showed mildly raised cerebrospinal fluid glucose and protein levels. At this point, it was felt that hyperglycaemia was the most likely cause for her seizure. Accordingly, her glycaemic control was optimised and preparations for discharge were made.\n\n【6】Nonetheless, an MRI scan of the brain was organised to definitively exclude structural pathology. This MRI showed that the patient had a subacute infarction of her left paracentral lobule as well as an infarction of the head of her left caudate nucleus. In addition, the MRI also showed that she had loss of the normal vascular flow void of the intracranial segment of the left ICA raising the suspicion of thrombosis of the vessel secondary to a dissection. Consequently, a CT angiogram was arranged and it confirmed near complete dissection of the left ICA. This pathology is depicted in Figs 1 – 5 .\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Images A and B are coronal views of the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence of the brain.

The derived CT angiogram demonstrated reduced filling in the left ICA. There was preservation of flow in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and left anterior cerebral artery (ACA), possibly due to adequate interhemispheric flow via the anterior communicating artery . She underwent further blood tests for anti-nuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-immunoglobulin G antibody anti-cardiolipin antibodies, all of which were negative. As part of a wider serological work-up, she also had negative results for lyme serology, hepatitis serology, human immunodeficiency virus, treponema pallidum and paraneoplastic antibodies. She was then started on anti-epileptic and anticoagulation therapy as management. She was reviewed via telephone 9 months later, at which point, she reported no further seizures or any other residual symptoms. She mentioned that she was back to her usual quality of life at this time.\n\n【23】Figure 6\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Images A and B show the CT perfusion map appearances of cerebral blood volume and mean transit time, respectively.

Moreover, ICA dissection is known to account for approximately 20% of stokes that occur in patients under 45 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. Collectively, these results stress the importance of ruling out other causes of focal-onset seizures such as ICA dissection when assessing a patient presenting with a new focal onset seizure even the context of convincing factors such as hyperglycaemia. The involuntary shaking of the right hand followed by sequential progression of seizure activity to the entire right body suggested that the focus of her seizure was the left primary motor cortex. This is well correlated with infarction in her left paracentral lobule given its anatomical proximity to left primary motor cortex. We felt that the left caudate nucleus infarction was likely secondary to seizure activity for two reasons. Firstly, it was of a lower hyperintensity as compared with the infarction in the left paracentral lobule. Secondly, the anatomical location of the left caudate nucleus infarction did not correlate as well with the clinical description of the seizure.\n\n【31】This case also demonstrates how it is insufficient to rely on CT to exclude structural pathology. Recent studies have revealed that CT failed to detect abnormalities which were detected on MRI in 26–57% of cases of a newly presenting seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guideline \\[CG137\\] section 1.6.21 states that MRI \\`is particularly important' in any patient with a seizure who has \\`any suggestion of a focal onset on history, examination or \\[electroencephalogram\\] (unless clear evidence of benign focal epilepsy)’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This case serves as a rationale behind the existence of such guidelines and provides some context in which these guidelines should be interpreted. In conclusion, we stress the importance of taking a careful history when evaluating a patient presenting with a new focal-onset seizure and we advise clinicians to always rule out other causes of seizures even in the context of convincing factors.\n\n【32】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【33】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【34】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【35】No sources of funding.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】Not applicable.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】The patient has provided written consent for publication of this manuscript.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】Anmol Pandey.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A clinical case report of a 11-year-old girl was diagnosed with frequent fecal incontinence four or more times daily for more than two months. An electroencephalogram (EEG) study suggested a prominent interictal spike and sharp wave discharge on the left hemisphere, mainly at the frontotemporal region without loss of consciousness or even speech disruption. This could be due to the normal EEG study of the dominant hemisphere. A magnetic resonance imaging study was done to exclude space-occupying lesions or focal lesions of the left hemisphere of the brain. An impression was made with abnormal EEG showing focal epileptiform activity as a final diagnosis. The patient was treated with Leviteracetam anti-epileptic drug 250 mg twice daily with significant clinical improvement at a 3-month follow-up.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Recently, vast attention was brought toward epilepsy with an explosion of information regarding etiology, pathophysiology, and different behavioral, medical and surgical management approaches. Epilepsy is a common condition seen very frequently in neurological practice having a great impact on health with variable cognitive, psychiatric and functional comorbidities with a negative social impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among 1% of the population diagnosed with epilepsy during their life, 75% are of the pediatric age group, with focal epilepsy being the most common subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】As a major type, focal epilepsy could be defined as a surge in brain activity arising from a localised area of the cerebral cortex. Variable signs and symptoms were reported depending mainly on the area of brain activity. However, according to symptoms variety, focal epilepsy may be sub-classified in different categories including motor, sensory, autonomic, and cognitive subtypes. Additionally, many focal epileptic patients experienced a warning sign (aura), such as the loss of awareness, strange smell, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 11-year-old, right-handed girl weighted 36 kg and no previous history of epilepsy or febrile convulsion. She was born by normal vaginal delivery after a full-term pregnancy with no remarkable medical conditions such as brain infection, brain trauma or any diagnosed metabolic disease. No previous history of convulsions was recorded. However, the patient was diagnosed by her family as having frequent fecal incontinence four or more times daily for more than 2 months. No other symptoms, triggers or warning signs were noted.\n\n【8】The following possible differential diagnoses were excluded through proper medical history, examination and investigations: chronic constipation, cerebral palsy, neurogenic bowel, Hirschsprung disease, coeliac disease, anorectal malformation, spina bifida, spinal dysraphism, myelomeningocele, neurogenic bowel and tethered spinal cord.\n\n【9】The abdominal ultrasound, abdominal X-ray with contrast, bowel motility study, rectal wall biopsy, Coeliac immunological screen, brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging all showed normal results.\n\n【10】The whole workup re-evaluation was done aiming to find out the diagnosis for this presentation. A breakthrough piece of information in the medical history caught the attention of the treating physicians when the family told them about a family history of epilepsy. In our community, such a disease could be considered as social stigmata and people are trying to avoid discussing these issues. Then, considering her family history of epilepsy, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered and performed.\n\n【11】While the patient was conscious, alert and cooperative, an EEG examination (with Cadwell ARC essentia device brand) was performed through 18 channels in a bipolar mode of activity with a microvolt sensitivity of 10. A 20-min waking period was obtained, including opening and closing of the eyes, with 3 min of hyperventilation and intermittent photic stimulation at 10, 20 and 30 frequencies as an evocative procedure. Results were suggested as a well-organised background activity in the range of complex partial seizures (CPS), responses to eye-opening and closing were normal, hyperventilation causes slowing of clear asymmetry and transients of fronto-temporal sharp were noted; the detailed EEG information shown in Figure 1 . A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was done to exclude space-occupying lesions or focal lesions of the right hemisphere of the brain. An impression was made with abnormal EEG showing focal epileptiform activity as a final diagnosis. The patient was treated with Leviteracetam anti-epileptic drug 250 mg twice daily with significant clinical improvement at a 3-month follow-up with no potential side effects of prescribed anti-epileptic medication reported.\n\n【12】Figure 1\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】( **A** ) EEG (bipolar montage) with left frontotemporal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharge. ( **B** ) Multifocal epileptiform discharge (average montage) most prominent over the left frontotemporal region.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Studies showed that some seizure types could be followed by many unusual symptoms such as fecal incontinence with some degree of unconsciousness, like Benign Rolandic Epilepsy. Regarding this case, the patient underwent fecal incontinence without a loss of consciousness with a prominent interictal spike and sharp wave discharge on the left hemisphere, mainly at the frontotemporal region on EEG study without a loss of consciousness or even speech disruption. This could be due to fact that most of insular area in human is found on the left hemisphere with a high connection with the prefrontal area, so ictal activities or lesion effects in this area may cause painless distended rectum and defecation to occur accidentally with totally intact consciousness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Several cases were reported as fecal incontinence or an urge to defecate, but with the presence of intermittent fall as the main manifestation. A previously published short communication reported two children with idiopathic partial epilepsy associated with fecal incontinence, pointing out to the role of alteration in the cortical area involved in the regulation of muscular tone of pelvic floor muscles through nearby epileptic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Another case report has discussed a middle-aged female with partial epilepsy and an urge to defecate associated with visual symptoms and a secondary generalized tonic–clonic fit, suggesting a cortical lateralization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, in our reported case, normal neurological examination and brain MRI with abnormal focal epileptiform discharge on the right frontotemporal region confined the diagnosis to idiopathic focal epilepsy that led to fecal incontinence and a significant clinical improvement following antiepileptic treatment after a 1-month follow-up. Other studies with a specific emphasis on pathophysiology are required to confirm and explain rare symptoms.\n\n【17】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【18】None declared.\n\n【19】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【20】Authors declare no funding to be reported.\n\n【21】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【22】Not required.\n\n【23】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【24】A written consent was obtained from patient’s parents for research and publication.\n\n【25】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【26】Laith Al-Ameri.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It was more for distance than during near work. He did ~8–10 hours of near work without using glasses as it reduced his diplopia.\n\n【8】The patient had no history of head trauma, use of systemic medication or systemic illnesses. Ophthalmic examination revealed unaided visual acuity (VA) of 2/60 in both eyes and used −5.75 DS in the right eye (RE), giving VA of 6/36 and −5.75DS/−0.50 DC @180 in the left eye (LE), giving VA of 6/24.

The mechanism of Beilchowsky-type AACE is thought to be uncorrected myopia with excessive near work, resulting in the inability to maintain the balance between the converging and diverging forces of the eye, and the subsequent development of increased tonus of the medial rectus muscle, leading to esotropia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a study of acquired distance esotropia associated with myopia in young adults by Zheng K _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, 11 adult myopic patients with distance esotropia were studied, who were engaged in near work for an average of 12 hours per day. Among them, seven underwent a pathological examination of their LR muscles, which showed no muscle fibers but rather collagenous fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In another study by Zhu M _et al._ , it was found that ACCE was more common in young adults who performed excessive close visual activities and used digital devices late night 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Since most of our daily activities are performed over smart phones, smartphone use is the majority of ‘near work’. Decreasing near work activities can help decrease the progression of esotropia in myopia in young adults.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】I extend my sincere thanks to the patient for trusting me with his treatment.

The lesions were first noticed on his chest, upper extremity and back **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Figure 1 **\\]</u>.** The rash was extremely pruritic resulting in insomnia for the previous 2 nights which went unrelieved despite oral diphenhydramine. Also concerning to him and his wife was the whip like nature of the rash which was somewhat linear and run vertically right down his back in a manner unlikely to be produced by simple excoriation. In addition, he denied reaching for or scratching his back in any manner. Review of systems was negative, and he denied any recent history of travel, similarly sick contacts or recent outdoor contactants or change in body soaps or laundry detergents.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Patient with very characteristic linear rash involving his back(left), neck and antecubital fossa (right).\n\n【12】He denied any prior history of similar rashes and his past medical history was non-contributory. A detailed exposure history revealed the patient had eaten mushrooms 48 hours ago during dinner at a Chinese cuisine buffet. He admitted to ingesting great quantities of a medley of cooked and raw mushroom including the Shiitake mushroom variety.\n\n【13】Physical examination was striking with a truncal dominant but generalized rash in a centripetal distribution . The lesions consisted of raised, relatively uniform erythematous papulovesicles arranged in linear arrangement. Close-up views **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Figure 2 **\\]</u>** confirmed the papulo-vesicular nature of the rash with multiple small papules grouped both along the breadth and length of each linear streak within an erythematous background.\n\n【14】**Figure 2**\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Close up view from the back revealing an erythematous papulovesicular rash. Note multiple papules along the streaks, both longitudinally and side to side along the breadth.\n\n【17】Given the clinical history and presentation the diagnosis was consistent with a shiitake dermatitis. Flagellate patterns of eruption have also been noted in drug reactions particularly to bleomycin, peplomycin (a bleomycin derivative), docetaxel, adult-onset Still’s disease, and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> **.**\n\n【18】The patient was put on a mid-potency topical steroid (Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment applied to affected areas twice daily). The rash resolved within 1 week. It has been reported that shiitake dermatitis can also resolve spontaneously.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】Shiitake dermatitis is a unique condition that is primarily characterized by the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions that it leaves on the extremities and trunks of patients. The first report of this dermatitis was in 1977 in Japan. Nakamura had observed that the ingestion of uncooked or under cooked shiitake mushrooms ( _Lentinula edodes_ ) was causing these peculiar skin eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> **.** There have since been many more cases reported not only in Asia, but in Europe and the Western Hemisphere as well. It is expected that as the popularity of shiitake mushrooms continues to grow there will be more cases of shiitake dermatitis reported.\n\n【21】There is little known about underlaying pathophysiology. In many cases reported there is often a delay of 24–72 hours between the consumption of the mushrooms and when the eruptions become noticeable, but the possibility of seeing eruptions sooner than that has been reported. In one case reported eruptions started only 5 hours after consuming raw shiitake mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> **.** Lentinan, a polysaccharide that is found in shiitake mushrooms is believed to play a role in causing the eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> **.** Whether it is a toxic reaction or a late hypersensitivity reaction, once ingested the polysaccharide will elicit the secretion of interleukin-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> **.** This cytokine promotes an inflammatory response in the body that results in the whiplash or flagellate patterned eruptions. Heat favors this theory because when fully cooked shiitake mushrooms are consumed no dermatitis is visible. The heat that is used when cooking the mushrooms denatures the lentinan making it nonfunctional.\n\n【22】Bleomycin a drug used in many cancer therapies also could induce flagellate dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinically it may appear that bleomycin and shiitake mushrooms cause the same cutaneous effects, but a major distinguishing characteristic that is seen in bleomycin induced flagellate dermatitis is the visible hyperpigmentation that occurs at the site of the eruptions.\n\n【23】Typically, treatment options for shiitake dermatitis also known as flagellate dermatitis are similar; clinicians can prescribe oral antihistamines and/or topical corticosteroids to help reduce the inflammatory response. As to the duration of the cutaneous eruptions when the dermatitis is caused by the consumption of shiitake mushrooms, most eruptions will clear up within days. Simple avoidance is also important in the prevention of further eruptions. With regards to bleomycin in most cases patients must change their cancer therapy regimen or wait until their regimen is completed before the eruptions begin to resolve. Even after completion it can take several weeks to months for the eruptions to clear up.\n\n【24】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【25】Hubert Huho Chavez, with HubLab LLC for researching trends in Mushroom consumption in the world and specifically in the United States and reviewing and editing the manuscript and photos.\n\n【26】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【27】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【28】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【31】None required.\n\n【32】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【33】Signed by patient.\n\n【34】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【35】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is frequently used to evaluate for vitreous hemorrhage, foreign bodies, retinal detachment, optic neuritis and posterior vitreous detachment; however, it can also be used to evaluate for a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). A POCUS can reveal a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface, and this is referred to as a retrobulbar ‘spot sign’ (RBSS). We present the case of an 88-year-old male that presented to our community ED with a painless loss of vision to his right eye. A POCUS revealed an RBSS of the central retinal artery and he was subsequently diagnosed with a CRAO. At his 1-month follow-up, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision, however, remains with significant visual impairment.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】A central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis. Research has shown that within 90–100 min of infarction, the retina begins to develop permanent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Some case reports show that the visual recovery beyond this time frame is related to the collateral flow, intact cilioretinal artery and incomplete occlusion of the central retinal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. The incidence is 8.5 per 100 000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This type of cerebral vascular accident has a mean age of 60–65 years, with over 90% of the cases involving patients over the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 88-year-old male presented to our emergency department (ED) with an acute onset of a painless loss of vision to his right eye. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (on apixaban). He stated he was lying in bed reading when he had a sudden painless loss of vision to his right eye, described as a curtain closing, for which he presented to our ED ~24 h later. He denied any other symptoms including headache, scalp pain, jaw claudication, focal weakness, numbness, angina or shortness of breath.\n\n【6】Vitals on arrival to the ED were as follows: 36.9°C, heart rate of 62 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, blood pressure of 123/53 mmHg and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. His cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. His neurologic exam was notable for a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of +2 for complete unilateral vision loss to the right eye. Intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg bilaterally. His remaining physical exam was notable for a right afferent pupillary defect (APD). To further assess the eye and its structures, a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was then performed. Utilizing the high-frequency linear probe to the right eye, a transverse view demonstrated a retrobulbar spot sign (RBSS) in the distal portion of the central retinal artery within the optic nerve sheath . He had normal blood flow in his left eye , and no blood flow was seen to the central retinal artery of the right eye, with the yellow arrow pointing to the RBSS . The patient was then transferred to our tertiary referral center (TRC) for specialist consultation.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Transverse view using the high-frequency linear probe of the right eye; arrow demonstrates RBSS within the optic nerve sheath.\n\n【10】**Figure 2**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】( **a** ) Normal retinal blood flow in left eye; ( **b** ) CRAO with no blood flow seen to the central retinal artery or retina in right eye, yellow arrow highlights RBSS.\n\n【13】Ophthalmology visualized a plaque on the dilated fundoscopic exam with associated retinal ischemia. Given the onset of ~24 h prior to arrival, the risks of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) outweighed the benefits, as such, the patient was medically managed. His head computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable for acute changes. A magnetic resonance imaging MRI could not be done, secondary to his pacemaker not being compatible. His carotid duplex was without severe stenosis or thrombus. His echocardiography showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, which was similar to previous studies.\n\n【14】Overall, his workup was without evidence of carotid artery disease or vasculitis and it was suspected to be cardioembolic in origin related to his atrial fibrillation. On further questioning, it was found that the patient’s family member had passed away 2 weeks prior, leading to depression and multiple missed doses of his anticoagulation. Compliance of his anticoagulation was stressed on discharge. At his 1-month follow-up after his hospital admission, he has regained light perception and 15% of his vision.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】A CRAO is a rare presentation in the ED; however, it is an ophthalmologic emergency with a poor overall prognosis which requires a high index of clinical suspicion. The clinical presentation of a CRAO in the ED typically involves a patient with an acute, painless unilateral loss of vision, with the possibility of temporal sparing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The pertinent differential diagnoses for acute painless vision loss include optic neuritis, central retinal artery/vein occlusion, retinal detachment, temporal arteritis and atypical/complex migraines, to name a few. Optic neuritis may present with painful eye movements and temporal arteritis may have associated craniofacial pain despite the neuropathy being painless.\n\n【17】The ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies the central retinal artery. The central retinal artery provides blood supply to the inner retina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An acute occlusion of the central retinal artery results in ischemia to the inner retina, which may appear pale and edematous.\n\n【18】On the physical exam, patients may have an APD. A fundoscopic exam may show a ‘cherry red spot’, with a pale retina that is seen in ~90% of patients, or ‘box car segmentation’ that is seen in ~15% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For many causes of acute painless loss of vision in the ED, a dilated fundoscopic exam has been considered the gold standard. However, not many emergency physicians feel comfortable performing this, especially in a setting without ophthalmology coverage and with potentially limited resource settings. Alternatively, ultrasound (US) can provide a rapid and useful diagnostic tool.\n\n【19】A US of the eye can be performed at the bedside to evaluate for blood flow and for a hyperechoic density in the optic nerve sheath just proximal to the retinal surface. When this density is seen, this is referred to as the RBSS and can indicate the type of embolism responsible for clinical symptoms. This RBSS is the actual clot responsible for the loss of vision; it is likely a cholesterol and fibrin clot that occludes the ophthalmic artery and retinal blood supply 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. RBSS on US been seen in up to 51% of CRAOs and is found to have 100% specificity for thromboembolic CRAO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–9 \\]</u>. When present, RBSS has been shown to have a poor long-term prognosis, and visual symptoms are poorly responsive to thrombolytics or other therapeutic interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. If an RBSS is not visualized, other etiologies for CRAO should be considered and evaluated. An ocular US can also be used to assess for blood flow in the central retinal artery and vein using color Doppler imaging. In the setting of CRAO, there will be reduced or no blood flow in the central retinal artery in the affected eye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. CRAO is considered a stroke-equivalent, so patients in the ED should undergo further evaluation and be admitted for risk factor modification.

Various maneuvers are often attempted for patients presenting within 24 h of symptom onset. Techniques include ocular massage (direct and intermittent pressure over a closed eyelid for 10–15 s at a time with a rapid release to facilitate a pressure gradient that could potentially dislodge any embolism) and anterior chamber paracentesis (this allows for an acute decrease in intraocular pressure that could dislodge any embolism). Medications include intraocular pressure lowering agents (topical timolol, intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol), vasodilatory agents (e.g. nitroglycerin) and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Overall, little data exist to show that any of the above methods will improve the patient outcomes compared with observation alone, with some evidence showing they may actually worsen the visual outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Further, no clinical trials have demonstrated any improvement compared to the observation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Other potential treatment modalities include the use of thrombolytics. Since a CRAO is a vaso-occlusive phenomenon, there has been interest in using tPA, with some published reports showing some improvement; however, it is not considered as the standard of care and is considered as an unproved benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

The aneurysm was treated successfully. Six years later, however, she presented with a progressive _en coup de sabre_ deformity, leading to the diagnosis Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS), a rare diagnosis characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones and often associated with various non-specific intracerebral abnormalities. In this patient retrospective analysis of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging imaging indeed revealed intracerebral calcifications and aspecific white matter lesions. Remarkably, in this patient the giant intracranial aneurysm turned out to be the presenting symptom of PRS years before the characteristic facial deformities became apparent.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS) is a slowly progressive syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones. It is a heterogeneous disorder with an incompletely understood pathogenesis. Several etiologies have been proposed, including auto-immunity, vascular dysfunction, trauma, infection, autonomic dysfunction, neural crest migration disruption and a possible genetic predisposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. PRS is suggested to be part of a larger disease entity, which encloses linear scleroderma en coup de sabre as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most frequent systemic manifestations of PRS are neurologic, affecting up to 20% of patients. These neurological symptoms include seizures, migraines (sometimes leading to hemiplegia), brain atrophy, cranial neuropathies, intracranial aneurysms and other intracranial vascular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Ophthalmologic abnormalities include enophthalmos, uveitis, retinal vasculitis, ptosis and abnormal ocular movements due to muscle paresis or weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>.

Except for intermittent headaches, occurring approximately once every month, there were no other clinical symptoms. Neurological examination showed no other abnormalities, including normal ophthalmoscopy.

She was referred for neurosurgery, where balloon occlusion of the aneurysm was performed successfully.\n\n【36】Postoperatively, we observed minimal right sided ptosis and slight difference in pupil size, the right pupil being smaller . The patient complained of headaches along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, which was successfully treated with carbamazepine for 6 months.\n\n【37】On routine check-ups, a progressive en coup de sabre deformity was noted on the right forehead, where originally the hemangioma was located . Retrospectively, the brain CT showed right occipital intracerebral calcifications . Furthermore, the brain MRI showed white matter lesions in the area of these intracerebral calcifications, possible vascular degenerative (developmental venous angioma) . The patient still complained of right sided migraines. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PRS was made 6 years after surgery.\n\n【38】Currently, the patient is 20 years old. Routine yearly check-ups including brain imaging show a slight progression of the hemifacial atrophy, unchanged appearance of the occluded aneurysm and no expansion of intracranial calcifications and white matter lesions . Furthermore, no additional aneurysms have been found.\n\n【39】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【40】PRS is a rare syndrome characterized by hemifacial atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bones. While symptoms are mostly neurological, various other organ systems can be affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 – 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】Intracranial aneurysms in PRS are rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 10 \\]</u>. In these cases, the patients were already diagnosed with PRS years before aneurysm development. By contrast, in our patient, the initial symptom was a right abducens nerve palsy caused by an intracranial aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The diagnosis PRS was only made a few years later, when the hemifacial atrophy became more apparent. Both the hemifacial atrophy and the intradermal capillary hemangioma were located on the right forehead, but the location of the hemangioma did not fully correspond with the extent of the atrophy. Therefore, the atrophy cannot be explained by the presence of the hemangioma.\n\n【42】To our knowledge, this is the third report describing an association between PRS and intracranial aneurysms in childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Bosman _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> describe a 10-year-old patient with a giant intracranial aneurysm and two additional smaller intracranial aneurysms. Schievink _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> report a patient with PRS who had multiple and progressive intracranial aneurysms that required treatment at the age of five, 12 and 21 years old.\n\n【43】In conclusion, there might be an association between PRS and intracranial aneurysms and a intracranial aneurysm can be the presenting symptom of PRS. In case of a intracranial aneurysm in PRS, these aneurysms can be multiple and progressive, therefore regular follow up is advised.\n\n【44】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【45】We thank our patient for her consent to publish the case and the related pictures.\n\n【46】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【47】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【48】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【49】The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\n\n【50】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【51】Informed consent was taken from the patient for publication of the case report.\n\n【52】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【53】Patient's written consent was taken for publication.\n\n【54】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【55】L.A.

Patients with this syndrome may also have adermatoglyphia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis, and acral dorsal nonscarring blisters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Very few occurrences have been reported in the literature but none of the cases presented with beard alopecia, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first case of this extremely rare syndrome reported from Syria.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 38-year-old Syrian man presented to the Dermatology department at Tishreen University Hospital with main complaint of multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard associated with diffuse brown reticulate hyperpigmentation. The patient was born to Syrian second-degree relatives with no family history of similar disorder. However, he had a cousin who was born with the same symptoms. The patient had normal physical, social and mental development without prominent medical, surgical or drug history.\n\n【7】On examination, the reticulate hyperpigmentation involved the neck, trunk, extremities  and was more obvious on axilla  and palms . It began at birth and became severe in adulthood; the intensity of hyperpigmentation slightly decreased at the age of 30 but remained present. The oral mucosa was not affected, no oral leukoplakia or pallor. No dental abnormalities were found. Scalp and body hair was thin since childhood. No eyebrow, axillary or pubic hair loss was noted. Nine months ago he developed multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard . The hair pull test was negative. The morphology of the hair shaft was normal on clinical and microscopic examination. Onychodystrophy of many fingernails and toenails was found, it started at 13 years of age then the fingernails improved during the last 10 years while the dystrophy of toenails became worse . Nail clipping for fungus and a fungal culture were negative. There was a history of hyperhidrosis along with hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints over fingers and toes .There was not palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or acral dorsal nonscarring blisters.\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Reticulate hyperpigmentation on neck, trunk and extremities.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Reticulate hyperpigmentation on axilla.\n\n【14】**Figure 3**\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Reticulate hyperpigmentation on palms.\n\n【17】**Figure 4**\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Multiple nonscarring alopecia on the beard.\n\n【20】**Figure 5**\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Onychodystrophy of many fingernails and toenails.\n\n【23】**Figure 6**\n\n【24】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【25】Hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints.\n\n【26】**Figure 7**\n\n【27】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【28】Hypoplastic dermatoglyphics of fingerprints.\n\n【29】Neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, auditory and visual examination was normal.

Since first described by Hauss and Oberste-Lehn in 1958 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, DPR has been acknowledged as a very rare disorder with approximately 21 reported cases among the regions of America, Europe and Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is characterized by a triad of diffused reticulate hyperpigmentation, nonscarring alopecia that may include the scalp, eyebrows or axillary hair and onychodystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of DPR can be made clinically based on the previous triad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Other associated features include: hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis, acral dorsal nonscarring blisters, adermatoglyphia and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>. The reticular pigmentation of DPR occurs at birth or in early childhood on the trunk, neck and proximal limps, it presents throughout life without spontaneous fading.\n\n【43】Other diseases fall under the category of reticulated pigmentary disorders that should be considered and excluded are: Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadasson syndrome (NFJS), Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC), Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditary (DUH), Dowling-Degos disease, reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura, acromelanosis progressiva and hereditary symmetric dyschromatosis of Dohi.\n\n【44】NFJS is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndrome manifested with poorly developed dermatoglyphics, onychodystrophy, abnormal sweating, and palmoplantar keratoderma. It is distinguished by reticulate hyperpigmentation that fades after puberty, and severe dental anomalies leading to early dental loss which does not correlate to the manifestations of our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【45】DKC is an x-linked disease characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation, nail dystrophy, adermatoglyphia and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Other features of DKC mainly include bone marrow failure, oral leukoplakia and abnormal dental findings. However, our patient did not show any of these features thus DKC was excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditary is a rare genodermatosis characterized by small irregular hyper-and hypopigmented macules present in early childhood on the trunk and extremities but palms and soles usually are not involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This dyschromatosis is associated with high-tone deafness that was not present in this case.\n\n【47】Dowling-Degos disease or reticulate pigmented dermatosis of the flexures was also excluded as it presents in adult life where distinct distribution of pigmentation in the flexural areas (groin, axillae and inframammary), facial pits and perioral scars are found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】While in reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura, acromelanosis progressiva and hereditary symmetric dyschromatosis of Dohi, hyperpigmented macules can be observed especially on the dorsal aspect of the hands and feet in a reticular pattern.\n\n【49】Based on previous studies, it is the first time that we report a DPR patient with beard alopecia which suggests that nonscarring alopecia in DPR may include other sites of the body not just the scalp, eyebrows or axillary hair.\n\n【50】Histologically, some distinctive features such as perivascular localization of spindle and epithelioid melanophages with some large forms containing prominent coarse melanin granules were noted in our case.\n\n【51】Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for DPR but we can manage some cutaneous distress such as palmoplantar keratoderma by keratolytic and topical retinoids.\n\n【52】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【53】DPR is a very rare disorder usually misdiagnosed but it should be taken into account when seeing the triad of generalized reticulate hyperpigmentation, nonscarring alopecia and onychodystrophy. This case suggests that alopecia in DPR may include other sites of the body not just the scalp, eyebrows or axillary hair. Therefore, correlation with future reported cases will be required.\n\n【54】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【55】The authors are grateful for Bardisan Gawrieh, Pediatric Surgery Department, Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria; Mariana Haydar, Department of pediatrics, Pediatrics and Obstetrics Hospital, Lattakia, Syria, for their valuable support.\n\n【56】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【57】There is no funding.\n\n【58】_Conflict of Interest statement._ No conflicts of interest.\n\n【59】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【60】No approval was required.\n\n【61】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【62】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and the figures related to it.\n\n【63】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【64】Lama Elias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

These swellings appeared spontaneously or after trivial injury and either used to resolve spontaneously or they ossified into mature bone. These flares of heterotopic ossification resulted in gradual restriction of movements of neck, trunk, shoulder, elbow, hip and knee joints. There was associated congenital hallux valgus bilaterally . There was no history of similar illness in her family. The radiographs of the girl showed certain characteristic features of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).

A CT scan of dorso-lumbar spine showed a peculiar ‘Y-shaped’ soft tissue ossification extending from the inferior angle of bilateral scapulae to the midline soft tissue of posterior back (lattisimus dorsi muscles and thoracolumbar fascia). It also demonstrated dorso-lumbar scoliosis and fusion of posterior elements of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae .\n\n【2】Figure 1:\n\n【3】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【4】( **a** ) Characteristic malformed great toe and hallux valgus.

During the first decade of life, sporadic episodes of painful soft tissue swellings (flare-ups) occur which are often precipitated by trivial injury. These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone causing restriction of movements of various joints. The flares may partially respond to a short course of steroids, but overall prognosis is reduced with median lifespan of 40 years.

Single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy prior to 22 weeks of gestation has been reported to be strongly correlated with double twin demise. To our knowledge, there are no case reports on the natural course of a surviving co-twin in an MM twin pregnancy resulting in live birth after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation. Here, we report a case of a surviving co-twin, after a single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation in a MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage leading to porencephaly, and live birth at 36 weeks of gestation.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Monochorionic monoamniotic (MM) twin pregnancy is the least common type of twin pregnancy and carries a high risk of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Single IUFD in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is a devastating condition for the surviving co-twin due to acute fetal hypovolemia and anemia through blood transfusion from the surviving fetus into the demised fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Previous studies have suggested that almost all single IUFDs that occur prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy have been reported to result in double twin demise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 4 \\]</u>. Here, we report on an extremely rare case of a surviving co-twin after single IUFD at 21 weeks of gestation due to cord entanglement in an MM twin pregnancy, with an antenatal diagnosis of renal hypoplasia and severe neurological damage, resulting in porencephaly and live birth.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 33-year-old female, gravida 2, para 2, was referred to our hospital for the management of an MM twin pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. At 20 weeks of gestation, the entanglement of the umbilical cords was observed on ultrasound. At 21 weeks of gestation, IUFD of one fetus was confirmed and the surviving fetus displayed mild hydrops fetalis with the findings of subcutaneous edema and pleural effusion. Increased middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was observed (42 cm/s: >1.5 MoM), suggesting that acute anemic status caused by blood transfusion from the surviving fetus to the demised fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Serial counseling was provided for the mother and her family regarding the expected poor prognosis of the surviving co-twin and the possibility of severe neurological impairment and double IUFD; however, the mother chose to continue with the pregnancy.\n\n【6】At 23 weeks of gestation, the hydropic changes of the surviving fetus disappeared. However, atrophy of cerebral parenchyma with an enlarged posterior horn of the lateral ventricle was observed. At 26 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus revealed severe ventriculomegaly, atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum . Additionally, at 26 weeks of gestation, oligohydramnios with amniotic fluid index (AFI; normal range: 5–25 cm) of 1.8 cm acutely emerged. At 30 weeks of gestation, bilateral renal hypoplasia became apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> . Interestingly, the volume of the amniotic fluid started to increase gradually from 28 weeks of gestation up to AFI of 15 cm at 34 weeks of gestation .

The live male infant had a weight of 2775 g with an Apgar score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Seven days after the birth, a head MRI revealed the characteristic findings of microcephaly and porencephaly . Additionally, bilateral renal hypoplasia was also apparent \\[long axis length of right/left kidney: 18 mm/31 mm (normal range: 39–51 mm)\\] 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Two days after the birth, the serum creatinine level was 1.44 mg/dl; however, it spontaneously decreased to 0.80 mg/dl at 11 days after birth. The general condition of the infant was good, and the infant was discharged 12 days after the birth without any medication. The infant is currently under follow-up and has only slight rigidity in the limbs, predominantly on the left side, at 3 months of age .\n\n【17】Figure 4:\n\n【18】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【19】Transition of biparietal diameter (BPD).

In our case, the surviving fetus displayed not only neurological damage resulting in porencephaly, but also bilateral renal hypoplasia, which were speculated to be caused by acute detrimental circulatory changes on the brain and kidneys after single IUFD. To our knowledge, there have been no case reports that describe the antenatal course of a surviving co-twin after a single IUFD prior to 22 weeks of gestation in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【25】Genova _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported that severe kidney failure was recognized in only 1 of 44 cases (2.3%) of single IUFD in monochorionic twin pregnancies. In our case, the surviving fetus exhibited signs of kidney failure from the severe oligohydramnios and renal hypoplasia seen on ultrasound. It is noteworthy that the volume of the amniotic fluid started to increase continuously from 28 weeks of gestation up to a normal range. One possible explanation for this change is that the fetal renal function might be gradually ameliorated because of the recovery from aberrant circulatory status of acute blood loss and hypovolemia as a result of single IUFD. Additionally, it is speculated that a certain number of nephrons were still preserved even if bilateral kidneys were morphologically impaired, which is supported by the fact that a blood creatinine level spontaneously decreased after birth. Our case provides valuable evidence that severe renal damage during the fetal period could recover, resulting in a live birth. However, it is difficult to predict the long-term prognosis given the short 3-month follow-up. Further close attention to renal function is necessary to assess the risk of chronic kidney disease later in life.\n\n【26】In conclusion, this is a case report on a surviving fetus with an extremely rare clinical course after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy. The important aspect of this case is that a monoamniotic twin not only survived after early demise of its co-twin but also demonstrated recovery of renal function in the neonatal period despite the prenatal diagnosis of bilateral renal hypoplasia. We feel that this case report provides valuable information to enable both obstetricians and patients to make informed choice and furthers the understanding of the fetal pathophysiological changes after a single IUFD in an MM twin pregnancy.\n\n【27】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【30】None declared.\n\n【31】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【32】None.\n\n【33】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【34】N/A.\n\n【35】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【36】N/A.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In patients with cortical hearing loss (and in the absence of communication deficit, either total or partial, as in agnosia or aphasia), some attention-related or language-based disorders may lead to a wrong diagnosis of hearing impairment. The authors present two patients (8 and 11 years old) with no anatomical damage to the ear, the absence of neurological damage or trauma, but immature cortical auditory evoked potentials. Both patients presented a clinical history of multiple diagnoses over several years. Because the most visible symptom was moderate hearing loss, the patients were recurrently referred to audiological testing, with no improvement. This report describes the use of long-latency evoked potentials to determine cases of cortical hearing loss, where hearing impairment is a consequence of underdevelopment at the central nervous system.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】We report two cases of centrally related hearing loss in children (8 and 11 years old) affected by an underdeveloped maturational processing in the primary auditory cortex that is initially observable through objective and subjective hearing impairment. Traditionally, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) have been used to obtain information of the area of the brain where the auditory cortex (primary and secondary) is located 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Long-latency evoked potentials (LLEPs) are said to relate to attention, memory and auditory discrimination skills 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. We believe that LLEP is a robust test that can be applied to identify cortical hearing loss associated with immature central processing.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】An 8-year-old boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective hearing loss. The boy was initially diagnosed with a probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but no language-based learning disability had been found by a preliminary psychological assessment. A pure tone audiometry (250–4000 Hz) demonstrated thresholds of 45–60 dB hearing level (HL) for the right ear and 50–60 dB HL for the left ear . Tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) as well as crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflexes were normal. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. An EEG test to discard tumor/trauma showed normal results. A well-formed brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test was recorded bilaterally . Results in the perception test (identification of two-syllable words at different HL levels) proved 100% accuracy at 50 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 35 dB HL for the left ear. He then performed an LLEP test in three sweeps (80, 60 and 40 dB normal hearing level (nHL) tone bursts at 250–2000 Hz) in the right and left ears, alternatively, which shows the absence of CAEPs for the 40 dB nHL stimulation and polyphasic interwave morphology . The patient was widely awake during the procedure with eyes open.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Audiogram and BAEP results for the 8-year-old child (on the left) and the 11-year-old child (on the right).

CAEPs can be observed at 80 dB nHL with double negativity. Latency values are delayed for all CAEPs, especially for N2. Interwave morphology is very irregular, with multiple periods, which is not normal for pre-teen age. Cortical maturation of the older child is similar to the young boy, which recommends further neuropsychological testing.\n\n【13】### Case 2\n\n【14】An 11-year-old boy presented at the Otorhinolaryngology day ward with a medical history of moderate language-based learning disorders. The boy was referred to the ENT clinic with a suspicion of objective and subjective hearing loss. The patient had a previous pathology of bone dysplasia in the left malar. A pure tone audiometry showed normal hearing , the results of the tympanogram and TEOAE were normal and the acoustic reflexes (stapedius reflex) of the middle ear showed no anatomical disorder. Results in the perception test proved 100% accuracy at 40 dB HL for the right ear and 100% at 50 dB HL for the left ear. A neurological examination using CT scan revealed no significant findings in the anatomy of the ear. Neurological history was complemented with a BAEP test, which proved normality . The LLEP test shows that waves with polyphasic morphology plus no CAEP could be identified for the 60 and 40 dB nHL stimulations . The recording of CAEPs occurs while the patient was awake with eyes open.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Recent studies increasingly use CAEPs as an early indicator of cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present the same method adapted to children to identify immature cortical development that may only be appreciated through moderate hearing loss. Patients in this report present no lesion on the temporal lobe or any other neurologically related pathology. There is no visible damage to the anatomy of the auditory system or the peripheral nervous system. They share a long clinical history and moderate language-based deficit and/or attention. We have used latency (ms) but not amplitude as the measure to classify CAEPs 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1, N1a, N1b, P2 and N2)</u>. Amplitude may not be an objective measure for the population described here because its objective value decreases with attention, so it does not seem appropriate for younger patients or patients with a suspicion of attention deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Maturational changes in CAEPs include decreases in latency and amplitude as well as dynamic morphological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We have observed that interwave amplitude decreases with stimulus intensity, which was predictable. However, polyphasic morphology (multiple periods between CAEPs) should not be present in children older than 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. This fact is so obvious that it prevents from the identification of specific CAEPs. The neural generators of P1 originate in the thalamus–cortical projections to the auditory cortex and may represent the first recurring activity in the cortex. The emergence of N1, on the other hand, has been compared with the maturation of axon neurofilaments and various critical stages in speech perception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We could assume then that both P1 and N1 reflect second-order processing of the auditory cortex. Normal values for P1 can be found ∼97 ms for 7–8 years and ∼77 ms for 11–12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, these values seem normal (78 ms) for the 8-year-old child and slightly late (89.5 ms) for the 11-year-old child. However, more clear is the emergence of double negativity represented by N1a and N1b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Latencies are delayed for the rest of CAEPs. The P2 component measures were 291.5 ms in the case of the 8-year-old child and 312.65 ms for the 11-year-old child (vs. normal 150 ms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>). The N2 component is present in the two patients, with late latencies (∼400 ms for both patients). Studies have also shown that the N2 component may be used as an objective measure of temporal processing ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Normal values for N2 are 243 ms (for 8 years old) and 226 ms (for 11 years old).\n\n【18】Overall, the preliminary diagnosis of hearing impairment in these patients needs to be complemented as a case of cortical hearing loss. The case of the pre-teen is especially important because objective and subjective audiological testing discarded severe hearing impairment, yet LLEP test indicates similar late maturation when compared with the younger boy. These cases are becoming more recurring in our clinic, which advises for the use of LLEP for two reasons: first, to identify whether we are dealing with a case of cortical loss and secondly, to assess the need to complement with neuropsychological testing (in the absence of neurological trauma/pathology). In the cases reported, values of P1 (78 and 89.5 ms, respectively) were within the normal range, with double N1 component and late latencies for P2–N2 when compared with standard values (291.5 and 312.65 ms for P2, respectively, vs. normal 150 ms; ∼400 ms for N2 vs. normal 243–226 ms, respectively). CAEP amplitude was not considered, but the polyphasic morphology of the waves and the absence of some CAEPs at various intensity levels were used to demonstrate underdevelopment at the cortical area that advises for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【19】In conclusion, this case report gives evidence of two children who display some learning difficulties, as reported by caregivers and psychologists. The two children are initially diagnosed with light to moderate hearing loss by the delivery of subjective tests (pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry). However, TEOAE and immittance audiometry (stapedius reflex) proved normal for both patients. In the absence of any anatomical damage to the ear or neurological lesion/trauma as tested by CT scan and EEG, a combination of two electrophysiological tests (BAEP and LLEP) led to the final diagnosis of a centrally related hearing loss: with normal BAEP results, late latency in LLEP proved the lack of maturational central processes in both children, which coincide with psychological evidence. These results advise for complementary neuropsychological study.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【23】This work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (FFI2010-18205) and the Secretary of State for Research, Development and Innovation.\n\n【24】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【25】Research presented in this manuscript has obtained ethical approval by Hospital Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, and University of Seville (Spain).\n\n【26】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【27】Participants in this report and parents/tutors have been informed on details of the study, including benefits in participation, possible risks, right to leave without previous notice and all contact information from responsible researchers.

Availability of reports on PTs with size of 31 cm or more in diameter in the literature are extremely rare. Herein, the case of a 17-year-old female patient with a giant recurrent right breast PT is reported. Histologically, the tumour showed proliferation of stromal tumour cells consisting of spindle cells with uniform nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and proliferation labelling index for Ki67 of <10%. PTs require meticulous surgical excision due to the fact that they have a high rate of recurrence and status of surgical margins must be included in the pathology report. This is because recurrent cases of PTs tend to grow faster than the primary ones with a high chance of transforming to malignancy.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial tumours of the breast with incidence accounting for <1% of all breast tumours and 2.5% of fibroepithelial tumours, and they are classified as benign, borderline or malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These tumours are fast growing tumours and can reach a median size of 4 cm and sometimes can grow up to 50 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are few reported cases of PTs in adolescents. The mean age of PTs at diagnosis is 45 years (range 35–55 years) and commonly occur in third and fourth decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Until 2015, there were only 20 cases of PTs in adolescents that were already reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Approximately 70% of PTs are benign; however, 20% of them undergo malignant transformation whereas 10% are usually borderline at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Herein, an adolescent female with a highly recurrent and benign giant PT is being reported.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 17-year-old female was brought as an outpatient in the department of general surgery with a 2-year history of a huge ulcerating, painful and tender right breast mass. On physical examination, she was ill-looking, febrile and mildly wasted. She reported four different excisions in the past 2 years. Two excisions were done at a health centre and unfortunately the excised tumour masses were not evaluated histologically due to lack of pathology laboratory. The subsequent two excisions after recurrence were done at two different private hospitals. One histological report indicated fibroadenoma and the fourth report revealed benign PT. The right breast was very huge with ulcerating skin surface and was forming nodules . Ultrasound revealed a tumour, which measured 31 × 30 × 21 cm, calcified with regular borders and not fixed to the underlying tissue, but the left breast was normal. Chest X-ray showed clear lungs. Both fine-needle aspiration cytology and mammography could not be done because were not available. Modified radical mastectomy was performed by involving a significant amount of pectoralis major muscle. Macroscopically, the tumour was extensively necrotic, haemorrhagic and nodular. Grossly, the surgical margins were 3.4 cm far from the tumour . On microscopic examination, the tumour was hypercellular and was composed of uniform and slender spindle cells, and it was forming fascicles . The cells had uniform vesicular nuclear chromatin and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . A few mitotic figures <5 per 10 high-power fields were also seen . All ER, PR, HER2, SMA, S-100, vimentin and P53 antibodies were negative except Ki67 that showed proliferation labelling index of <10%. After a postoperative period of 8 months, she was found to be free from local recurrence or metastasis following evaluation with chest and abdominal computed tomography scan.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】( **A** ) Clinical appearance of the lesion; ( **B** ) cut surface of the tumour is showing haemorrhage and necrosis.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】( **A** ) Stromal hypercellularity of the lesion. The proliferating spindle cells are uniform and slender with vascularization in some areas (haematoxylin and eosin staining, ×100); ( **B** ) the packed hyperchromatic tumour cells are showing streaming of the cytoplasm in some areas with few mature lymphocytic infiltrate (haematoxylin and eosin staining, ×200); ( **C** ) the cells have spindle nuclei and some with prominent nucleoli and marked hyalinization (haematoxylin and eosin staining, ×400); ( **D** ) the plasma cells are proliferating in a stroma with marked oedema and vascularization (haematoxylin and eosin staining, ×200).\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Patients with PT usually present with round, mobile and painless breast lumps, which are more commonly in the upper outer quadrant with equal chance of the two breasts to be involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. About 20% of the patients have palpable axillary lymphadenopathy and a significant proportion of the patients have history of fibroadenoma with up to 20% of them being with high local recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis study done by Lu _et al_ . in China reported the pooled local recurrence rates for benign, borderline and malignant PTs to be 8, 13 and 18%, respectively. This shows that the tendency of PTs to recur locally increases with increase in aggressiveness of the tumour. The study also reported that mitoses, tumour border, stromal cellularity, stromal atypia, stromal overgrowth and tumour necrosis can independently predict development of local recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The categorization of PTs into benign, borderline and malignant was described in the study by Salvadori _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Confirmation of diagnosis of PTs is done by histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Mammographically, PTs are clearly defined masses with a smooth and occasionally lobulated border, whereas on ultrasound they often show smooth contours with low-level homogenous internal echoes, intramural cysts without posterior acoustic enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Mammographically, both PTs and fibroadenoma show coarse microcalcification, but ‘malignant’ microcalcification in PTs is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It has been found that the presence of both epithelial and stromal elements within the cytological smear supports the diagnosis of PTs and not fibroadenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Surgery is the initial treatment for PTs with preferred wide excision for clear surgical margins, particularly for malignant ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The mean time for local recurrence has been reported to be around 2 years. This is different from the present case in which there were three consecutive local recurrences within a period of 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Options for failure to obtain negative surgical margins include re-excision, radical resection of the chest wall and reconstruction using a composite mesh (inner polytetrafluoroethylene and outer vypro), pedicle latissimus dorsi flap and a split skin graft for the recurrent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiotherapy have no proven benefits in the treatment of PT in regards to its recurrence and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In a study by Kario _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> reported that stromal overgrowth increases the possibility of local recurrence by seven times, whereas surgical margin <1 cm increases the risk by five times.\n\n【18】The case described in this report sheds light on the importance of evaluating histologically all excised breast lumps in order to confirm the diagnosis and not generalizing that every benign looking breast lump is fibroadenomas. This may help to avoid missing of the proper diagnosis as it was in the present case. This report also explains the importance of wide local excision for giant PTs (>10 cm in diameter), which helps to prevent local recurrence.\n\n【19】In summary, PTs are extremely rare in adolescents and they grow rapidly with a high risk of local recurrence. Ensuring wide excision during surgery is of utmost importance for obtaining negative surgical margins in order to prevent possibility of local recurrence.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】No ethical approval was needed.\n\n【28】INFORMED CONSENT\n----------------\n\n【29】The author confirms that he had obtained a written informed consent from the patient’s parents for publication of the case details and any accompanying images.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by sustained hypereosinophilia associated with end-organ damage. Based on underlying molecular mechanism of eosinophilia, there are different subtypes of HES. Diagnosis of HES subtype can be challenging, especially in the absence of overt lymphoid/myeloid neoplasms or discernable secondary causes. Long-term outpatient follow-up with periodic complete blood count and repeated bone marrow biopsy may be needed to monitor disease activity. Somatic signal transducer and activation transcription 5b (STAT5b) N642H mutation was recently found to be associated with myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia. We report a case of HES who presented with pulmonary embolism and acute eosinophilic pneumonia, found to have recurrent STAT5b N642H mutation by next-generation sequencing, suggesting possible underlying myeloid neoplasm.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a group of disorders characterized by persistent eosinophilia and evidence of eosinophilia-related end-organ damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Recurrent somatic signal transducer and activation transcription (STAT5b) N642H mutation was recently reported to be associated with myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, however limited cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We report a case of HES who presented with pulmonary embolism and acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and was found to have recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation by NGS.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 72-year-old Caucasian gentleman without significant past medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring 0.7 FiO <sub>2 </sub> oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula. He was in his usual state of health until 2 weeks earlier when he traveled to CA, where he was briefly hospitalized twice for chest pain, fever and diarrhea. He was diagnosed with ‘type B aortic dissection’, pneumonia and viral gastroenteritis.\n\n【6】He presented to our institute with dry cough and shortness of breath. He was on beta-blocker for recent diagnosis of ‘type B aortic dissection’. On physical examination, he was hypotensive (84/44 mm Hg) without tachycardia (88/min), afebrile, tachypneic (22/min) and hypoxic (SpO <sub>2 </sub> 85% at room air). There were bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. Initial differential diagnosis included aortic pathology, thromboembolism, infection and hematologic disorders. Electrocardiogram and serum troponin were normal. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed marked leukocytosis (50 k/μl) with eosinophilia (4.0 k/μl), thrombocytopenia (82 k/μl) and normal hemoglobin level (15.6 g/dl). Chest X-ray showed mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1a **\\]</u>** . Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography ruled out acute aortic injury, but revealed acute pulmonary embolism in the right middle lobe, patchy peribronchial ground glass opacity, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1b **\\]</u>** . Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs was negative for deep vein thromboses. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. He was given oxygen by high-flow nasal canula, heparin infusion, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and was admitted to the ICU.\n\n【7】**Figure 1**\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】(a) Chest X-ray shows bilateral, perihilar mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates simulating pulmonary edema. (b) Chest CT shows bilateral patchy ground glass opacity, interlobular septal thickening (arrow) and several sub-6 mm lung nodules (arrowhead). (c) Abdomen and pelvis CT shows multiple peripheral low-attenuation areas in the spleen consistent with splenic infarcts (arrow).\n\n【10】Infectious workup including blood culture, stool ova and parasites, and serologic testing for _Strongyloides_ and coccidiomycosis were negative. Peripheral smear was absent for dysplastic eosinophils. Flow cytometry was negative for a B- or T-cell clonality. Cytogenetic testing of peripheral blood was negative. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple new splenic infarcts without hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 1c **\\]</u>** . To confirm eosinophilia-related end-organ injury and rule out infection, diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. It revealed a total nucleated cell count of 663 with significant eosinophilia (86%). Transbronchial biopsy showed focal interstitial pneumonitis, foci of organizing pneumonia and clusters of eosinophils within alveolar spaces and interstitium **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 2 **\\]</u>** .\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Histologic findings in the transbronchial biopsy (a) interstitial eosinophils  and small foci of organizing pneumonia (\\*\\*), H&E, 20×, ruler 80 μm.

Treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg (60 mg) was initiated. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia responded to prednisone **通用删除8(英):<u>\\[** Fig. 3 **\\]</u>** .

Prednisone was tapered off at 2.5 months. Repeated CT chest at 6 months revealed complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates. Patient followed with hematology/oncology service every 3 months. He continued to be asymptomatic with excellent performance status and no limitation in daily activities. However, 11 months after hospital discharge, CBC showed gradual worsening erythrocytosis (hemoglobin 18.8 g/dl and hematocrit 56%) with low serum erythropoietin level, and increase in eosinophils (3.2 k/μl). Bone marrow biopsy with NGS for myeloid mutation panel was performed at 4 months and 11 months post discharge. It revealed recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation and ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutation. Although no overt myeloid neoplasm was found, given reported association of STAT5b N642H mutation with myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, the working diagnosis evolved toward myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia. To control worsening erythrocytosis and eosinophilia, hydroxyurea 500 mg once daily was started. Cell counts subsequently improved. Given the inability to rule out myeloid neoplasm, patient was committed to long-term anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】HES with lung involvement can present as acute eosinophilic pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The radiographic manifestations can resemble pulmonary edema in the active phase with bilateral areas of ground glass opacity and smooth interlobular septal thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Persistent eosinophil infiltrates in the lungs can lead to intraluminal fibrosis that resembles organizing pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. HES is a hypercoagulable disorder. Thromboembolism, both arterial and venous thrombosis, is a common complication of HES and can be life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Recently, NGS targeting genes that are known to be associated with myeloid neoplasms have been increasingly applied to patients with idiopathic HES, especially when a clonal eosinophilia is suspected, but conventional cytogenetic testing is negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Frequently detected mutations by NGS are genes involving DNA methylation and chromatin modification, such as TET2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These mutations have also been frequently found in elderly general population (affecting about 10% of persons older than 70 years of age) and are associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus the detection of such mutations needs to be interpreted in the context of other clinical and pathological findings when establishing a diagnosis of clonal hypereosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Recurrent somatic activating STAT5b N642H mutation was recently found in seven cases of idiopathic HES and 20 cases of myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of STAT5b N642H mutation in patients with HES.\n\n【22】In summary, we reported a case of HES with recurrent somatic STAT5b N642H mutation, suggesting possible underlying myeloid neoplasm.

The rate of the tachycardia had been measured up to 250 bpm inducing marked dizziness. Slower ectopic rhythms around 100 bpm were also recorded. Various degrees of atrioventricular block could also be seen during tachycardia. The patient was initially treated with flecainide 100 mg bid but since 3–4 months the tachycardia recurred many times a week lasting from 1 minute to a couple of hours.

One sinus beat can also be seen (S).\n\n【20】Intracardiac measurements showed that during the premature beats and the tachycardia the high right atrium and the coronary sinus os were activated simultaneously and that the lateral wall of the right atrium was late.\n\n【21】At that point of time, the differential diagnosis based on right atrial mapping was: a focus in the right interatrial septum, a focus in the non-coronary aortic cusp, a focus in the left interatrial septum, a focus in the right upper pulmonary vein. The earliest atrial activation during the arrhythmia was found in the high right septal area with a prematurity of minus 30 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave. Pacing at that site was the best site to reproduce closely the timing and the morphology of the right intra atrial and coronary sinus electrograms during the arrhythmia.\n\n【22】One radiofrequency application at that site was unsuccessful. The left atrium was accessed via transseptal puncture. A Biosense Lasso catheter was positioned in the right superior pulmonary vein (RPSV) as well as a Biosense Thermocool Smarttouch D curve ablation catheter. These catheters were connected to a 3D electroanatomical system (Carto3, Biosense Webster, USA).\n\n【23】After placement of the Lasso in the RSPV, at the antero–inferior part of the Lasso (electrodes 7–10), small fragmented potentials with a prematurity of minus 100 ms in relation with the beginning of the P wave during extrasystoles were seen. There was also an inversion of the normal sequence of RPSV activation: the venous potential preceded the far field atrial potential on the premature beats , demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin.\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【26】The Lasso catheter (PV1–2 = > 9–10) is positioned at the ostium of the right superior pulmonary vein. PV 1–2 records the roof of the vein. One sinus beat (S) followed by one ectopic beat (E) is seen. The Lasso recording shows a normal sequence of activation on the sinus beat: a far field atrial activity (A) followed by a pulmonary vein potential (PV). The ectopic beat shows an inversion of the sequence of activation (PV precedes A) with fragmented PV potentials (PV 7–10) preceding the far field atrial potentials (A) and the beginning of the P wave by 100 ms and also preceding the other PV potentials recorded by the Lasso catheter demonstrating the pulmonary venous origin of the ectopy.\n\n【27】We could also see an alternation of sinus rhythm and RPSV regular atrial rhythm around 43 bpm with inversion of the normal sequence of activation of the pulmonary vein on the abnormal beats .\n\n【28】**Figure 4**\n\n【29】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【30】A regular atrial rhythm at 43 bpm is seen. The first three beat are ectopic (E), the fourth is of sinus origin (S), the fifth represents fusion between sinus and ectopic (F) followed by an ectopic beat and a sinus beat. There are only slight atrial cycle length changes during this sequence. (A) represents the far field atrial potential. PV represents the RSPV pulmonary venous potential. On Lasso PV 1–2 the inversion of the normal sinus sequence of activation (A-PV) can be seen during the ectopy (PV-A). This change is magnified at 100 mm/s on Fig. 3 .\n\n【31】The RPSV was isolated with an encircling lesion. After isolation was completed, a slow irregular dissociated rhythm with a cycle length between 380 and 680 ms was visible inside the vein. Mapping the dissociated rhythm within the RSPV with the ablation catheter showed fragmented potentials preceding the earliest Lasso activation by 35 ms. These were recorded a few centimeters inside the vein, beyond the right heart radiologic border.\n\n【32】During a 24 hour follow-up only the typical sinus node atrial activation could be seen.\n\n【33】The patient remains asymptomatic after a follow-up of 3 years.\n\n【34】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【35】This case report demonstrates that ectopy coming from the RPSV may cause rapid tachycardia but may also be responsible for very slow stable atrial ectopic atrial rhythm mimicking sinus rhythm. Pulmonary vein tachycardia has been shown to be associated with slow and fast ventricular rhythms in a limited number of cases. In some cases, it is, as in our case, due to slow and fast firing of the ectopic focus (3 cases described) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–3 \\]</u>. In two of them however the focus was situated in the left superior pulmonary vein. In some cases permanent rapid pulmonary venous firing mimicking sinus tachycardia caused heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】As far as the polarity of the ectopic P wave is concerned, it was in accordance with the RSPV localization suggested by Yamane _et al._ in their study on pulmonary venous pacing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Kistler _et al._ found in 27 cases that in the case of pulmonary venous ectopy 39% of the ectopic rhythms were coming from the RSPV and 39% from the left superior pulmonary vein. They also found that 93% of the pulmonary venous foci were ostial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This was not the case in our patient where the focus was situated inside the vein.\n\n【38】The main take home message is the following: changes in the polarity of the P waves, even subtle, despite a slow regular atrial rhythm should raise attention in patients complaining of paroxysmal tachycardia and could be a clue to the presence of an ectopic focus responsible for the complaints.\n\n【39】The polarity of the P wave may help in localizing the origin of the focus.\n\n【40】This also illustrates the ability of the RPSV to generate very slow or very fast ectopic rhythms in the same patient.\n\n【41】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【42】None.

ORN of the skull has not been reported following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We report two cases of ORN of the skull following SRS for recurrent meningiomas post-resection. Both patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps in areas that received high doses of radiation due to their proximity to the recurrent tumors. In each case, the ORN was asymptomatic and was detected on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging. Both patients were followed closely with imaging that ultimately revealed either stability or improvement in the ORN, confirming the diagnosis without the need for biopsy. The cases reveal a role for close imaging surveillance instead of immediate biopsy in patients with new enhancement involving bone in high-dose radiation treatment regions.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Osteoradionecrosis (ORN), ischemic necrosis of irradiated bone without evidence of persisting or recurrent tumor, is a known complication of radiation therapy, particularly in patients with head and neck cancer. The exact mechanism is unknown; however, the proposed mechanism is that radiation-induced vascular changes result in diminished blood flow and ultimately in a hypocellular, hypovascular and hypoxic environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While often asymptomatic, symptoms and sequelae of ORN can vary in severity and include pain, fracture, chronic non-healing wounds and superimposed infections. To date, literature review did not reveal any reports of ORN of the calvarium following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We present two cases of ORN of the calvarium following SRS for recurrent meningiomas after initial resection.\n\n【4】CASE REPORTS\n------------\n\n【5】### Case 1\n\n【6】The first patient is a 50-year-old woman with history of a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I meningioma in the parieto-occipital region, which was resected in 1999 with subsequent radiographic recurrence. Initial post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal residual tumor and annual MRIs were stable for 7 years. She was then lost to follow-up until 2012 when an MRI revealed a 25-mm contrast-enhancing lesion at the resection cavity consistent with meningioma recurrence, and corresponding computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of adjacent bone erosion . The patient was treated with linear accelerator-based, framed SRS (14 Gy in one fraction) to the recurrent meningioma. She did well without issues for 5 years except for the interval development a 9 mm focus of enhancement within the surrounding brain parenchyma that resolved in ~6 months without intervention and was ascribed to radiation treatment effect (RTE).\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Case 1 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI axial slice obtained at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (white arrow) and ( **B** ) comparable axial CT slice also obtained at the time of SRS; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 4 years post-SRS and ( **D** ) at the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **E** ) CT at the time of development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS (denoted by yellow arrow); ( **F** ) corresponding relative cerebral blood volume map (from dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging) reveals relative hypoperfusion of the enhancing lesion (denoted by white arrowhead; red = increased perfusion, blue = decreased perfusion).\n\n【10】The patient’s MRI at 5 years post-SRS revealed a new enhancing lesion immediately adjacent to the treated meningioma, which in retrospect may have begun developing 4 years post-SRS . This lesion involved the craniotomy bone flap, and a head CT confirmed a new 38-mm osteolytic focus involving that segment of the cranium . Perfusion MRI showed relative hypoperfusion at this site . After examination of all available images, including overlay of the SRS isodose cloud , the appearance was most consistent with ORN. Repeat brain MRIs and head CTs 6 months and 1.5 years later revealed the stability of this lytic lesion as well as the residual treated meningioma . The patient remained asymptomatic with the exception of rare episodes of minor focal scalp discomfort. Given the continued stability, this process was determined to be most consistent with ORN and biopsy was not pursued.\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Case 1 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion. Identical serial T1 post-contrast MRI axial slices obtained ( **A** , **B** ) at the time of the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS, with (B) showing the radiation isodose overlay (red corresponds to higher dose, blue to lower dose); identical CT head axial slices ( **C** , **D** ) at the time of the development of the lytic bone lesion 5 years post-SRS, with (D) showing the radiation isodose overlay revealing that the lesion is in the high-dose region; ( **E** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 6 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion and ( **F** ) comparable CT at the same timepoint; ( **G** ) T1 post-contrast MRI 1.5 years after the development of the lytic bone lesion and ( **H** ) comparable CT slice at the same timepoint.\n\n【14】### Case 2\n\n【15】The second patient is a 44-year-old woman, with a right posterior parasagittal WHO Grade II meningioma who underwent gross total resection in 2014 with post-operative imaging revealing no residual disease. No adjuvant therapy was pursued. She did well until a brain MRI in 2017 demonstrated a 2.1-cm recurrence along the superior sagittal sinus with no adjacent bone erosion on CT . She was asymptomatic and was treated with linear-accelerator-based, hypofractionated frameless SRS (30 Gy in five fractions) to the recurrent tumor. The patient did well for the next 2 years with significant tumor response except for the development of RTE in a small region of surrounding brain, which resolved without intervention.\n\n【16】Figure 3\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Case 2 prior to and at initial presentation of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained in 2017 at the time of SRS showing the initial meningioma recurrence (denoted by arrowhead) and ( **B** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice windowed for bone at that same timepoint; ( **C** ) T1 post-contrast MRI sagittal slice obtained at the time of development of an enhancing lesion involving bone at 1-year post-SRS (denoted by arrow) and ( **D** ) comparable head CT sagittal slice obtained at the that same timepoint revealing the lytic bone lesion at this site (denoted by arrow).\n\n【19】On serial imaging, an MRI 1-year post-SRS showed a new adjacent enhancing lesion that was associated with some bone lysis seen on CT without apparent growth of the treated meningioma . T1 post-contrast MRI and non-contrast head CT 3 months later revealed mild enlargement of the lesion . At this point, the differential diagnosis included ORN versus tumor progression. After discussion at tumor board, her case was felt to more likely represent ORN as the lytic lesion was within the high-dose region, as demonstrated on the isodose overlay . Further close interval monitoring was recommended. The next brain MRI 9 months after the development of the lytic lesion revealed stability of both the treated meningioma and the adjacent enhancing lesion , supporting the diagnosis of ORN.\n\n【20】Figure 4\n\n【21】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【22】Case 2 at initial presentation and subsequent follow-up of osteolytic lesion; ( **A** ) T1 post-contrast MRI and ( **B** ) comparable CT sagittal slices obtained 3 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion; ( **C** ) the radiation isodose is overlayed on the preceding CT showing that the high-dose region (red) corresponds to the location of the osteolytic lesion (presumed ORN) in this case; ( **D** ) sagittal T1 post-contrast MRI slice at 9 months after the development of the lytic bone lesion.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【24】To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of ORN of the skull following SRS. ORN is a known complication of radiation therapy most frequently reported following radiation to the head and neck. ORN can range in severity from being asymptomatic to causing pain, fractures, superimposed infection and chronic wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Management includes vitamin E and pentoxifylline for mild cases and hyperbaric oxygen and surgical resection for more severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The mechanism of ORN is thought to involve inflammation and fibrosis of the periosteal vessels, resulting in ischemia and avascular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The mandible is particularly susceptible due to its relatively low vascularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but ORN can affect other bones such as ribs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u> and vertebra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These two patients developed ORN in their craniotomy flaps after SRS to adjacent recurrent meningiomas.\n\n【26】After careful review in a multidisciplinary setting, the decision was made to follow the patients closely with imaging as opposed to proceeding with biopsy due to the high clinical suspicion for ORN. In each case, the craniotomy flap was within the high-dose region . The risk of ORN increases with increasing dose to the affected bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. It is likely that post-surgical disruption of blood flow to these flaps was confounded by vascular changes secondary to high-dose radiation leading to ORN.\n\n【27】Diagnostic considerations in such cases include ORN and tumor recurrence. The definitive way to make a diagnosis is through pathology review; however, an invasive procedure can often be avoided using serial imaging in asymptomatic patients. Stability of the lesion without intervention favors a diagnosis of ORN over tumor recurrence. Perfusion imaging can distinguish between malignancy and radiation necrosis in the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Radiation necrosis displays hypoperfusion, as was illustrated in the first case of ORN above, whereas malignancy displays hyperperfusion. While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to make the diagnosis, these cases demonstrate that, in patients with indolent courses, it is generally prudent to closely observe with imaging. In such cases, serial imaging revealing stability or improvement of the lesion(s) in question can solidify a diagnosis of ORN, avoiding an invasive procedure.\n\n【28】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【31】None declared.\n\n【32】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【33】None.\n\n【34】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【35】None required.\n\n【36】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【37】Consent was obtained from patients in both cases.\n\n【38】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【39】Ashley Schlafstein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In the immunocompromised patient, however, infections from unusual pathogens should also be considered. We describe the case of a 66-year-old male with a history of renal transplant who was diagnosed with flexor tenosynovitis by point-of-care ultrasound. Although initial wound cultures were negative, subsequent microbiological testing led to the underlying cause, a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Among patients presenting with evidence of forearm or hand infection, infectious flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) is an important diagnosis to consider, as failure to detect this condition may lead to severe morbidity and loss of hand function. The most common causes include _Streptococcus_ and _Staphylococcus_ species, including methicillin-resistant _Staph. aureus_ (MRSA), which may be introduced via a number of routes, including local trauma, contiguous spread or hematogenous spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

More recently, however, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has also been shown to be a rapid, effective adjunct for the diagnosis of FTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We present an atypical case of FTS in an immunocompromised patient diagnosed with the aid of POCUS, complicated by the presence of a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 66-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and renal transplant presented to the emergency department with several months of left hand swelling and pain. He denied any recent trauma or animal bites to his hand or arm.\n\n【6】On physical examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs. The fingers of his left hand were held in moderate flexion. He had swelling and tenderness of the volar distal forearm, hand and fingers, with pain on active and passive finger extension. No erythema and warmth were present. Sensation was intact with the exception of paresthesias of the distal fifth finger. Radial and ulnar pulses were intact.\n\n【7】Laboratory evaluation was notable for the absence of leukocytosis (white blood cell count 5.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) although C-reactive protein was elevated at 14.5 mg/L. Hand radiographs were unremarkable. A POCUS was performed using a high-frequency linear-array transducer on a Zonare ultrasound system (Zonare Medical Systems, Inc. Mountain View, CA) which demonstrated a large complex fluid collection surrounding the flexor tendons of the left mid-forearm extending to the volar aspect of the left hand . Fluid was also noted surrounding the flexor tendons of the left index finger .\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】In this transverse ultrasound view of the patient’s left palm, complex fluid  is seen within the synovial sheath surrounding the paired flexor tendons.

Operative findings included an extensive cavity of tenacious yellow/clear fluid with solid components extending from the left volar forearm through the carpal tunnel to the palm and volar thumb .\n\n【15】**Figure 3**\n\n【16】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【17】Intraoperative photo of the patient’s volar wrist and hand. Note the thick yellowish material adjacent to the surgeon’s finger as well as in the thenar eminence .\n\n【18】Blood, fluid and tissue cultures were sent, including gram-positive, gram-negative, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and fungal assays. The patient was empirically started on IV vancomycin, cefepime and fluconazole.\n\n【19】All initial cultures were negative, and preliminary AFB smear was negative. Three weeks later, wound culture results were positive for _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC). Further patient evaluation revealed the presence of a peripheral lung nodule with nodularity and cavitary changes concerning for atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient’s clinical course was complicated by the need for further operative debridement for residual MAC disease 5 months later. He was discharged on a 6- to 12-month course of azithromycin, rifabutin and ethambutol, as well as hand therapy.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】FTS is defined as inflammation of the tendon and synovial sheath and most frequently occurs in the upper extremities. Potential complications may include carpal tunnel syndrome, compartment syndrome, and even tissue necrosis requiring amputation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. FTS in immunocompromised patients may be caused by common skin flora or, as in our case, by more unusual pathogens. The broader differential diagnosis in patients with suspected infectious tenosynovitis should include infectious causes such as staphylococcus, streptococcus and mycobacterial infection as well as noninfectious causes such as injury, autoimmune or inflammatory tenosynovitis.\n\n【22】Soft tissue infections involving the wrist and palm may spread through the synovial sheaths that surround the flexor tendons of the hand. The common flexor sheath (also known as the ulnar bursa) contains the superficial and deep flexor tendons of the fingers, except for flexor pollicis longus, which is contained within a separate synovial sheath, the radial bursa. The ulnar and radial bursa communicate in 50–85% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, which may facilitate the progression of FTS to involve not only the palmar flexors but also the thumb, as in this case, requiring a separate thumb incision and debridement.\n\n【23】Ultrasonography has increasingly been recognized as a valuable imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with suspected FTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. On ultrasound examination, complex hypoechoic or anechoic fluid may be seen surrounding the flexor tendons within the fingers as well as in the hand and wrist, as in our case.

This report presents a new case of PCNSL that appears in an immunocompetent patient with two different rare genetic rearrangements and a necrotic histological appearance.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare highly aggressive extra nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the brain and spinal cord without systemic involvement. Most PCNSLs are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), accounts for 2–4% of CNS tumors and 4–6% of all extranodal lymphomas. Currently, immunocompetent patients represent the vast majority of patients with PCNSL. In addition, these patients are often diagnosed, mostly between the ages of 50 and 70 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This case study will present a 54-year-old woman diagnosed with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with _MYC_ and _BCL6_ rearrangements (double-hit lymphoma) rearrangements and a necrotic histological appearance. These results add a new case of rare MYC/BCL6 double-hit PCNSL to the literature.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 54-year-old Middle Eastern female patient presented to the emergency room for the evaluation of recurrent episodes of falling down for the past 6 months with preserved consciousness level. She had intermittent episodes of diffuse, progressive headaches lasting for 30 min. Her past medical history was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed mildly decrease in Power (4/5), hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski sign on the left side, with left side facial palsy. A brain CT scan performed at the local hospital showed a space-occupying lesion. The patient was then transferred to our hospital. After admission, a brain MRI was done and showed a large intra-axial lobulated solid mass centered in the right fronto-parietal region, measuring about 4 <sup>* </sup> 5.5 <sup>* </sup> 3.5 cm. The mass looked heterogeneous and hypo-intense on T1, hyper-intense on T2. The mass abuts the body and rostrum of the corpus callosum. There was vasogenic edema in the right front-parietal region, which extends into the contra-lateral side via the rostrum of the corpus callosum showing multiple hyper-intense FLAIR signals in the left periventricular region. There was compression of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle with midline shifting to the left side by 8 mm with subfalcine herniation. The mass looked highly vascular with no calcification or bleeding. CSF analysis was not done due to a mass occupying lesion with midline shifting on imaging .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Brain MRI showing right-sided fronto-parietal mass.\n\n【9】A resection and biopsy were done.

The patient clinically improved, she managed to walk independently, became free of headaches and her facial palsy improved _._ Microscopic features and immune-histochemical profile showed: positive for BCL2 and negative for CD10 raising the possibility for high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), although there were frequent tangible body macrophages resulting in a starry sky appearance which is typically seen in Burkitt lymphoma. CD20, MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6 were positive, while CD3, CD10, TdT and cyclin D1 immunostains were negative. Ki67 proliferation index is 98–100%. These all go along with HGBCL .\n\n【10】Figure 2\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】High-grade B-cell lymphoma.

There was no rearrangement of the BCL2 gene. According to these results, the diagnosis of PCNSL was made after a review in a multidisciplinary setting by a team involving in addition of neurosurgeon, a hematologist, a radiologist, a pathologist, etc.\n\n【13】Figure 3\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Pre-op vs. post-op brain CT scan.\n\n【16】The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group Score (IELSG) for the patient was 3/5, classified as a moderate-risk patient, correlating with 2-year survival rates of 48% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. After the diagnosis was confirmed, a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy were given, IV rituximab (375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> 600 mg d1) and IV high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) (3 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> 4.89 g d2), with supportive treatment. We did not proceed with MATRix and ASCT due to financial, resource and political issues, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient showed dramatic improvement in her symptoms of limb weakness, could take care of herself and could walk with no assistance. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative. Due to financial concerns, a PET CT and bone marrow were not performed. A whole-body CT scan was done and she was diagnosed with PCNSL. The follow-up brain CT scan showed a decrease in midline shifting and frontoparietal vasogenic edema.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION\n---------------------\n\n【18】PCNSL is a rare extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The gold standard for diagnosis is histopathological evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Genetic rearrangement in PCNSL carries a prognostic relevance and possible therapeutic potential. The majority of double-hit lymphomas (75%) are marked by MYC plus BCL2 translocations, while BCL6 translocation is less common. Lymphomas that morphologically resemble DLBCL but contain translocation in the MYC gene with rearrangement in BCL2 or BCL6 are described as double-hit lymphomas and considered high-grade B cell lymphomas rather than DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Approximately 5% of these lymphomas are double-hit lymphomas which are considered very aggressive tumors with worse prognosis if treated as DLBCL and are associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and earlier relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Without treatment, the survival is several weeks to months. However, treated patients have a 5-year survival of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A case series suggests that the therapy of these lymphomas needs to be targeted against the MYC gene and its proteins, as raising the dose of conventional chemotherapy has no effect on overall survival (OS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The IELSG score is used to estimate survival using five parameters (age, lactate dehydrogenase level, CSF protein concentration, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score and deep brain involvement). Low, moderate and high-risk patients have 80, 48 and 15% 2-year survival, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. Historically, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was used in the treatment of PCNSL. Despite the high response rate, it has limited survival benefits ranging between 12 and 18 months. Moreover, the neurotoxic effect that WBRT may have on patients has limited its use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Different chemotherapies were ineffective as they do not pass the brain–blood-barrier. Recently, the 7-year results of the IELSG32 trial were analyzed, providing the dramatic effect of the MATRix regimen (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab) with overall survival (OS) of 56%, MATRix plus consolidation therapy was associated with great durable outcomes and did a paradigm shift in PCNSL treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. MATRix has a better PFS and OS (52 and 56%) compared with the combination of HD-MTX/HD-AraC (20 and 26%) or rituximab/HD-MTX/HD-AraC (29 and 37%), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. PCNSL was treated with WBRT alone; the OS was 16 months, however, improved to 30 months using HD-MTX before WBRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. More recently, the (IELSG43) trial demonstrated that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) significantly improved outcomes compared with non-myeloablative chemoimmunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Patients undergoing surgical resection of a single lesion had a higher chance of complete remission 6 months postoperatively compared with biopsy. However, the OS and complication incidence were not statistically significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【20】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\n\n【21】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【22】This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【23】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【24】Nabil C.N.

On admission, his temperature was 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure of 104/50 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination was significant for chronically ill cachexic male with a BMI of 21 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , jugular venous distension, bilateral rales, tachycardia, RV heave and 4/6 pan-systolic murmur with a palpable thrill throughout the precordium. Blood cultures were obtained for suspected endocarditis and empiric intravenous antibiotics were started. An initial transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a large mass attached to the aortic valve leaflet measuring 3.2 × 0.6 cm (Supplementary Videos 1–2), severe aortic regurgitation with holodiastolic flow reversal in the aorta , mass attached to the flail anterior mitral valve leaflet resulting in severe mitral regurgitation , mass attached to pulmonic valve, significant pulmonic regurgitation  and severe pulmonary hypertension with Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure of 65 mm Hg. Additionally, dilatation of the aortic root along with fistula between the aortic sinus and the RV outflow tract was seen . Within 24 h, blood culture revealed gram-positive cocci in two out of two bottles, subsequently identified as Abiotrophia species. Patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further management. He underwent right heart catheterization demonstrating elevated filling pressures, low cardiac index and shunt fraction of 2.1. Emergent surgery revealed an aortic root abscess. He underwent prophylactic grafting of the left anterior descending coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery as the left main coronary Os was close to the aortic annulus. Patient also underwent bio-prosthetic pulmonary and mitral valve replacement, closure of the congenital VSD and closure of aorto-RV fistula using bovine pericardial patches in addition to an aortic root replacement with porcine root prosthesis. Post-operatively, patient developed atrial fibrillation and was subsequently started on amiodarone therapy. He was on intravenous penicillin and gentamycin during his hospitalization. Transesophageal echocardiogram, post intervention, revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45% and competent bio-prosthetic valves. Repeat blood cultures remained negative and patient was discharged on intravenous vancomycin via peripherally inserted central catheter.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Holodiastolic flow reversal in aorta.\n\n【10】Figure 2:\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.\n\n【13】Figure 3:\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.\n\n【16】Figure 4:\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.\n\n【19】Figure 5:\n\n【20】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【21】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【22】Figure 6:\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to pulmonic and aortic valves\n\n【25】Figure 7:\n\n【26】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【27】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).\n\n【28】Figure 8:\n\n【29】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【30】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to mitral valve.\n\n【31】Figure 9:\n\n【32】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【33】3D Transesophageal echocardiogram showing large vegetation attached to the mitral valve.\n\n【34】Figure 10:\n\n【35】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【36】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing possible flail mitral valve and large vegetation attached to aortic valve.\n\n【37】Figure 11:\n\n【38】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【39】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing vegetations attached to mitral and aortic valves.\n\n【40】Figure 12:\n\n【41】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【42】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe mitral valve regurgitation.\n\n【43】Figure 13:\n\n【44】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【45】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.\n\n【46】Figure 14:\n\n【47】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【48】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe aortic valve regurgitation and fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.\n\n【49】Figure 15:\n\n【50】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【51】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing severe pulmonic valve regurgitation.\n\n【52】Figure 16:\n\n【53】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【54】Transesophageal echocardiogram showing fistula between aortic sinus and the RVOT.\n\n【55】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【56】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【57】AD is a rare cause of endocarditis. However, few studies have estimated that AD is responsible for 5–6% of all cases of IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. AD is usually isolated from an immunocompetent host and is a very important cause of blood culture negative IE. It is often seen as a satellite lesion around other bacteria that secrete pyridoxal such as Staphylococcus. AD requires pyridoxine and Vitamin B6 for growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. AD is difficult to identify as it has unique nutritional requirements, is pleomorphic, and is a very slow growing organism. A rapid, yet simple and inexpensive method to identify AD is by using MALDI-TOF-MS (Matrix associated laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometer). AD endocarditis carries higher morbidity and mortality than endocarditis caused by any other streptococci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Multiple factors that add to the virulent nature of this organism are secretion of exopolysaccharide, ability to adhere to fibronectin and a special affinity for endovascular tissue. IE due to AD is also attributed to the preexistence of prior or congenital heart disease and has been reported to cause native and prosthetic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【58】Despite of the use of appropriate antibiotics, AD endocarditis is known to cause serious complications leading to heart failure, septic embolization and destruction of the valves. The recommended antibiotic treatment for AD endocarditis consists of penicillin or ampicillin with gentamicin for 4–6 weeks, according to the American Heart Association guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. _In vitro_ antibiotic susceptibility does not reflect clinical outcome. Heart failure is the most serious complication of endocarditis that often requires valve replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Aggressive treatment becomes essential with development of complications, with ~50% of the patients eventually requiring surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【59】In our patient, due to a definite embolization potential of the large vegetation and extensive multivalvular damage, a pulmonary, mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery was performed. A multi-disciplinary team comprising of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, infectious disease specialists and intensive care specialists contributed to the favorable outcome.\n\n【60】In general, Aorto-RV fistulas have been described to occur because of rupture of congenital and acquired sinus of Valsalva aneurysms. Other reported causes that result in aorto-RV fistula include blunt or penetrating chest trauma, aortic dissection, high ventricular septal defect repair and aortic valve surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report of AD endocarditis requiring replacement of pulmonary, mitral and aortic valves. This case also stands unique, as it demonstrates an association between Aorto-RV fistula and AD Endocarditis. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of Abiotrophia endocarditis that involved the aortic, pulmonary and mitral valve without an identified entrance route.\n\n【61】SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n----------------------\n\n【62】Supplementary material is available at _Oxford Medical Case Reports_ online.\n\n【63】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【64】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Our case report shows VZV reactivation following rituximab treatment in AAV patients. The recombinant zoster vaccine should be recommended before the start of induction treatment with rituximab.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels. AAV includes microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It may present with extrarenal manifestations with or without kidney involvement. Glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab for new-onset AAV are recommended as initial therapy. Although rituximab has been used for over a decade to treat AAV, there may be infectious complications during treatment.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 78-year-old woman had myeloperoxidase AAV and used a combination of induction regimens that incorporated oral cyclophosphamide and oral glucocorticoids. Due to refractory disease, she received remission induction therapy with three courses of rituximab. However, multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome after administration of the three courses of rituximab . She was diagnosed with a herpes zoster infection. After treatment with oral valacyclovir, significant remission of the background erythema with a gradual drying out of the old vesicles was noted after 5 days of antiviral therapy .\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Multiple grouped clear-fluid-containing vesicles erupted on erythematous plaques along the right T4 dermatome.\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Significant remission of background erythema with gradual drying out of old vesicles after 5 days of antiviral therapy.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Patients with AAV have higher mortality than the general population despite advances in treatment.

His history included refractory hypertension for 7 years, though he was receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs, including Valsartan (320 mg), Atenolol (50 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), spironolactone (75 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg). He also had a history of intracranial haemorrhage with complete recovery. His family history indicated a deceased cousin due to end-stage renal disease. On examination, he had elevated blood pressure (180/90), a distended but soft abdomen and a liver edge palpable 2 cm below the costal ribs.\n\n【13】Abdominal ultrasonography revealed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in addition to multiple cysts in both kidneys **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 1 **)</u>.** These findings were consistent with the ones in Multi-Slice Computerized Tomography (MSCT), in which three variable-sized cystic lesions were detected in both kidneys with a diameter of 32, 38 and 47 mm. The MSCT also showed the AAA that measured 3.6 cm, in addition to prostate hyperplasia. Furthermore, thorax MSCT images showed multiple aneurysms larger than 22 mm arising from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, the left circumflex and the right coronary artery. On echocardiography, there was an eccentric left ventricle hypertrophy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, while the electrocardiogram (ECG) uncovered a prominent left axis deviation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain showed an increased size of the cerebral ventricles in addition to multiple hypertensive lesions of 2–24 mm on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery and T2-Weighted Image. Laboratory tests revealed high levels of serum creatinine (6 mg/dl), urea (105 mg/dl), haemoglobin (9.1 g/dl) and platelets count (187\\*10 <sup>3 </sup> /dl). Twenty-four hours urinalysis showed an additional massive proteinuria of 4200 mg/dl, in addition to a trace of red blood cells without cellular casts in microscopic examination. The patient underwent a coronary catheterization in order to prepare him for renal transplantation, which clearly revealed ecstatic coronary arteries with multiple aneurysmal dilations in the three main coronary arteries **通用删除1(英):<u>(** Fig. 2 **)</u>** . Currently, the case is managed with haemodialysis sessions twice a week.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】Herein, we report a case of an association between ADPKD and coronary arteries aneurysms (CAA). To our best knowledge, this rare association is only described 16 times in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of ADPKD in our patient was based on the presence of multiple bilateral kidney cysts and extrarenal manifestations (Ravine’s Criteria), after ruling out other possible pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, the clinical course of the disease, the patient’s age and the normal values of inflammatory markers make Kawasaki disease in this patient less likely. On the other hand, patients with ADPKD have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms between 9 and 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, which suggests that the haemorrhagic stroke in our patient was probably underlined by a cerebral aneurysm. Further study with magnetic resonance angiography is recommended. Neves _et al._ deduced in their systematic review that 6 out of 23 ADPKD patients (40%) have multiple coronary aneurysms as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although these multiple involvements of coronary arteries are more frequently reported in ADPKD patients, aneurysms in the other vessels are still quite a rare association in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common associated vascular aneurysm with CAA is an AAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The association between multiple giant coronary aneurysms, which is quite rare, and other aneurysms including the AAA and the suspected cerebral aneurysm makes the presentation of our case extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, because the combination between these three pathologies in the context of ADPKD was never reported before.\n\n【16】Furthermore, the giant cardiac aneurysms were diagnosed accidentally in our patient who did not have any cardiac symptoms, and this is consistent with the findings of the aforementioned systematic review, which showed that 6 out of the 13 patients with coronary artery aneurysms were asymptomatic (21%). This should draw attention towards the significant asymptomatic cardiac manifestations in ADPKD, which might prevent grave prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although there are many recommendations regarding the isolated AAA and CAA, still such recommendation in the setting of ADPKD are unavailable. Boyer _et al._ recommended the surgical revascularization when a CAA involves the main stem of the left coronary artery, multivessel coronary artery disease is identified, a giant CAA is present or when other cardiac condition mandate surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence showed that all men aged 66 or more should be screened if they have not already been screened or they have one of the mentioned risk factors including hypertension. Additionally, they consider aneurysm repair for people with an unruptured AAA in case of symptomatic aneurysm, asymptomatic and larger than 4.0 cm with a growth by more than 1 cm in 1 year, or asymptomatic measuring ≥5.5 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Rare associations of vessels aneurysms might happen in patients with ADPKD, including the coexistence of AAA, giant multiple coronary aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms. Hypertension also represents a common manifestation of this entity and could be refractory as in our patient. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate for secondary causes in patients with refractory hypertension as early as possible and to screen for asymptomatic aneurysms in cases of ADPKD, in order to prevent serious complications.\n\n【19】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【20】We would like to thank Dr Jalal Habash for his support in preparing this report.\n\n【21】ABBREVIATIONS\n-------------\n\n【22】Autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), multi-slice computerized tomography (MSCT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\n\n【23】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【24】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【25】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【26】No funding was required.\n\n【27】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【28】Not required.\n\n【29】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【30】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the purpose of the publication of this case report and all accompanying images.\n\n【31】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【32】Assistant Prof. Sami Albitar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The earliest detectable abnormality in TA is a thickening of the vessel wall, but diffuse aortic wall calcification is very rare and is a late manifestation. Besides, the involvement of the coronary arteries is not a common finding in TA and frequently involves the right coronary artery (RCA). Multi-modality imaging has a fundamental role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and its complications. In this report, we want to present an unusual case with TA, diffuse aortic wall calcification and left main coronary artery ostial lesion, which is a rare combination.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Takayasu Arteritis (TA) is a type of vasculitis affecting aorta and its major branches, thought to result from an autoimmune process that targets large elastic-containing arteries. TA affects women eight times more frequently than men. Chronic inflammation of the vessel walls leads to aneurysm formation, stenosis or thrombosis. Cardiac involvement occurs eventually in nearly one-third of patients. Myocarditis also occurs in TA and causes potentially reversible congestive heart failure (CHF). Conventional angiography is invasive and provides the least sensitive method for visualizing wall thickness. Ultrasonography, and to a lesser degree, computed tomography (CT) can detect this early vessel wall thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can identify vessel wall thickening, stenosis, as well as aneurysm formation. Additionally, multi-parametric cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging assists in determining cardiac involvement, including myocarditis. In this article, we want to present a new case of TA with atypical features including diffuse aortic wall calcification, left main (LM) coronary artery ostial thickening, as well as myocarditis.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 37-year-old man, from Mazandaran, Iran referred to our hospital with a 4-month history of palpitation and dyspnea (NYHA functional class II). The patient had no medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. Also, no history of smoking or alcohol use, as well as shortness of breath and chest pain and angina symptoms during exercise was detected. However, he had a history of sudden cardiac death in his brother at the age of 37 years old, with no evaluation. Moreover, he had no evidence of arthralgia, fever, headache or dermatologic manifestation at the time of presentation. On clinical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg in both upper limbs, pulses were easily palpable, and there were no bruits. A systolic murmur with an intensity of II/VI heard at the apex and a diastolic murmur also heard in the aortic position with III/VI intensity. Furthermore, a small left cervical lymphadenopathy (short-axis diameter: 10 mm) was detected with no erythema or pain.\n\n【6】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, wright, coombs wright, 2-mercaptoethanol, the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests, lipid profile, liver function test and thyroid hormone levels were within a normal range. Notably, his hemoglobin level was 12.5 g/dl.\n\n【7】Since some researches have suggested an overlap between tuberculosis and TA, tuberculin test, sputum smear and culture for mycobacterium was carried out, which were all negative.\n\n【8】The echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with global left ventricular (LV) hypokinesia, mild LV enlargement, and moderate mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves regurgitation. To evaluate the coronary arteries, CT angiography was performed, which determined diffuse media thickening of the aortic root (5 mm), and a significant narrowing of the LM ostium . Besides, it displayed evidence of aneurysmal dilation of ascending aorta with extensive aortic wall calcification along its course . In this regard, coronary angiography confirmed CT results .\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】CT and angiography in TA. (A) CT angiography with multi-planar reconstruction shows significant LM lesion (arrow). (B) CT angiography of aorta without contrast injection depicts diffuse aortic wall calcification (arrow). (C) Invasive coronary angiography shows significant LM ostial stenosis (arrow).\n\n【12】CMR examination indicated severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, localized myocardial inflammation and subepicardial fibrosis in the inferior and anteroseptal LV wall in favor of active myocarditis . Furthermore, there was evidence of aortic wall thickening . In the MRA, aortic arch branches showed mild irregularity and focal narrowing, whereas the celiac trunk  and right renal artery had significant stenosis at their origin. In addition late gadolinium enhancement sequence revealed fibrosis of the aortic wall .\n\n【13】**Figure 2**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】CMR sequences in TA. (A) Late gadolinium enhancement image in candy can view shows gadolinium uptake of the aortic wall. (B) Axial localizer view shows thickening of the aortic wall.

(D) Late gadolinium enhancement image in basal short-axis view demonstrates LV lateral wall fibrosis.\n\n【16】Considering the mentioned findings (active inflammation of the aortic wall, myocardium, and LM stenosis as well as laboratory findings), all probable differential diagnoses evaluated by an expert rheumatologist, and ultimately the diagnosis of TA considered for the patient.\n\n【17】Regarding the clinical signs, findings of disease activity on CMR in both aorta and myocardial tissue, and decreased EF, intensive medical treatment selected for the patient.\n\n【18】The therapy started with 500 mg of methylprednisolone for 3 consecutive days and then continued at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, equivalent to 30 mg, daily, and reduced to 10 mg within 6 months.\n\n【19】In addition to steroid therapy, cyclophosphamide started for the patient at a dose of 500 mg for 3 consecutive months. The patient had two children and agreed to take the drug. However, we sent the patient’s sperm to the sperm bank for storage. Subsequently, treatment with injectable methotrexate at a dose of 20 mg per week continued. Due to CHF, anti-TNF drugs were not appropriate for the patient.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】TA is an idiopathic vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its branches, which results in the increased wall thickness of arteries, fibrosis, stenosis, aneurysmal formation or dilation, and thrombosis. In this report, we present an interesting case of TA diagnosed with a multi-modality imaging approach that had a combination of LM coronary artery involvement, entire aortic wall calcification, significant stenosis of the celiac trunk, and myocarditis, which is a rare combination in TA. Signs and symptoms characterizing the vascular inflammatory stage include, but not limited to, fatigue, fever, malaise, palpitation, headache, rash, hemoptysis and weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, disease activity may persist in the aortic wall, despite the patient being asymptomatic and all inflammatory markers may remain within normal limits. Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a marker of long-standing inflammation in TA, which is a very rare finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Coronary arteries, like other aortic branches, are involved in TA in 6–30% of cases. The right coronary artery is the most affected one. The most common site of coronary artery involvement is the ostium and proximal segments of the right and left coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The optimal coronary revascularization method for Takayasu patients is not known yet. Wong _et al._ concluded that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is better than percutaneous coronary intervention because the restenosis rate and major adverse cardiovascular events are more in PCI procedure than the CABG. More than a 9-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in the percutaneous procedure than CABG reported in this study. On the other hand, CABG in patients with TA has many difficulties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Because the left subclavian and internal mammary arteries are commonly affected, a saphenous vein graft is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3–5 \\]</u>. For the first time, Kuijer _et al._ reported a case in which a Dacron prosthetic patch utilize to insert the proximal anastomosis on an inflamed aorta. The patch prevented contact between inflamed tissue and the graft. They believe that in this way, the risk of graft failure will be reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Oishi _et al._ reported successful repair of ostial coronary artery stenosis using a femoral artery patch in Takayasu arteritis. It would be a reasonable surgical method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Therefore, three common surgical approaches are CABG, patch angioplasty of the LM coronary artery ostium, and transaortic coronary ostial endarterectomy. Although surgery is prohibited during the active stage of the inflammation, in a patient with unstable angina, it is applicable.\n\n【25】Hybrid CABG is an alternative technique. Preoperative stent insertion and subsequent off-pump CABG perform in the hybrid method. In the presence of the macroscopic calcification of the ascending aorta, conventional CABG is not the preferred technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thus, the Hybrid procedure is useful in patients with porcelain aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. As an alternative method, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can perform in Takayasu’s disease. This procedure has been offered in high-risk patients who refuse surgery or have severe pulmonary hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Because of the underlying inflammation and the higher rate of in-stent restenosis, interventional therapy was more associated with the re-interventions rate than the surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Diffuse aortic wall calcification is a late and rare manifestation of Takayasu arteritis. Multi-modality imaging using cardiac CT and CMR has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of vasculitis and portrays its complications.\n\n【27】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n--------------\n\n【28】No funding was received for this study.\n\n【29】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】All of the authors mention that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【31】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\n---------------------\n\n【32】All authors contributed to the data gathering and writing of the manuscript.\n\n【33】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【34】This study has ethical approval from the ethics committee of Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\n\n【35】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

He had increased sleep, muscle and bone pains, tingling and numbness of his fingers and in his lower extremities distally to his knees.\n\n【8】Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in January 2017 with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.9% which increased to 10.5% in December 2018 few months before presentation. His diabetes mellitus was being treated with Metformin which he was not compliant with. He also had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated with Gabapentin, right cerebellar gliosis 2/2 to right frontal ventriculostomy along with a history of depression and alcoholism (reports drinking 10 beers per day for 2 years. Each beer is 24 oz. He quit 3 weeks prior to presentation). He did not report any intake of antidepressant therapy or sedatives.\n\n【9】He is a thin, pale man of Asian descent. There were no signs of dehydration such as dry mouth, lips and eyes. Orthostatic blood pressures: 148/97 mm Hg while sitting and 93/64 mm Hg upon standing. Generally normal body and neurological exams. Neurologic exam was normal. Tilt table test was not performed because the hospital does not have the specific facility for the test. Pertinent initial laboratory findings were: HbA1c 10.2%, AST 87 mg/dL and normal ALT. An EKG showed long QT segment with QTc = 0.53 s.\n\n【10】He was admitted for further work-up of dizziness. Twenty-four hour telemetry were unremarkable. No cardiac echocardiography was performed. No dehydration was suspected due to normal laboratory work-up.\n\n【11】During hospitalization, he was evaluated by an endocrinologist and extensive laboratory studies including PTH, 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin B12, Free T4, ACTH, Cortisol, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin and IGF-1 levels all returned normal. Serum aldosterone and renin levels were normal excluding adrenal insufficiency as a cause for orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【12】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to rule out any liver injury secondary to alcohol use was normal. A CT brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial injury. A right cerebellar gliosis was evident along with prior right frontal ventriculostomy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild gliosis in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere underlying a right occipital craniectomy and a mild right frontal gliosis along a prior shunt tract .\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】T2 weighted MRI axial image showing right cerebellar gliosis related to a previous surgery.\n\n【16】He worked regularly with physical therapy and was taught posture stabilizing exercises, which improved his functional capacity and ambulatory abilities. He was diagnosed with dysautonomia secondary to alcoholism. His blood pressure improved to 130–140/70–80 mmHg with no significant drop on lying/standing measurements. He was discharged on midodrine 10 mg thrice daily, gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily and thiamine 100 mg daily.\n\n【17】In a 6-month follow-up visit, his HbA1c decreased to 6.5% being on insulin therapy. He denied any further alcohol intake. Although he was compliant to his medications, and was following instructions for management of his varicose veins, he still had intermittent episodes of orthostatic hypotension with blood pressure dropping occasionally to 100/50–60 mmHg. However, he did not report any further near-syncope episode. A gastrointestinal evaluation was scheduled because of significant weight loss.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【19】Alcohol and its metabolites can increase the concentration of vasodilators such as nitric-oxide activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and increasing plasma levels of the vasoconstrictor–angiotensin II at higher doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This will in return increase the sympathetic activity causing an increase in stroke volume as well as cardiac output due to sympathetic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Montforte _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> studied 107 patients who struggled with alcoholism versus 61 control subjects to assess the functions of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems in patients. They found that 26 patients (24.3%) had autonomic neuropathy and 34 (32%) had peripheral neuropathy. They concluded that autonomic and peripheral neuropathies are common among patients with alcoholism, and that alcohol is toxic to both autonomic and peripheral nerves in a dose-dependent manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This is the mechanism that we believe explains our patient’s symptoms as he was consuming over 240 ounces of beer daily for many years. Another study by Matikainen _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> was performed on 28 male patients with alcoholism revealing significant polyneuropathy with neurophysiological findings in 7% of subjects. A delay in parasympathetic parameters could be detected in the alcoholics compared with controls.\n\n【21】The most common neuropathy that leads to autonomic dysfunction is diabetes mellitus. However, alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy (ALN) is another important etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Uncontrolled diabetes and alcoholism are both present in our patient. In recent studies, failure of thiamine treatment to reverse ALN, together with new information demonstrating clinical and electrophysiological distinctions between ALN and nutritional deficiency neuropathies, suggests that alcohol itself may significantly predispose and enhance development of neuropathy in the appropriate clinical setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. For example, neuropathy can still develop in alcoholics on who are not thiamine deficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, subperineurial oedema is more prominent in thiamine deficient neuropathy, whereas segmental de/remyelination is more frequent in alcoholic neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient reported mild improvement in neuropathy in the follow-up visits after receiving thiamine treatment, similar to Peters _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> randomized controlled trial, and after improvement of HbA1c which leads us towards a diagnosis of ALN on top of his already established diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【22】In conclusion, alcohol metabolites can alter the endothelium leading to changes to the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems which can rarely persist for a long time despite control of risk factors.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【26】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【27】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】Not needed.\n\n【31】Verbal and written consents have been obtained from the patient.\n\n【32】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【33】Georges El Hasbani.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

AVMs clinical expression ranges from complete asymptomatic, and thus incidentally found, to life threatening with rupturing and bleeding. In this wide spectrum, osteolysis is considered as a rare complication of interosseous AVMs, and only few cases of mandible and maxilla osteolysis have been reported. We present, herein, a case of an intracranial AVM, which has caused in the course of the time an osteolysis of the dens and axis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Brain arterial malformation (AVM) belongs to cerebral vascular diseases and constitutes an abnormal direct connection between arterial and venous system in absence of an intervening capillary network. Due to this defected structure, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are prone to rupture, causing intracranial hemorrhage. Its clinical course can widely vary from asymptomatic, and thus only incidentally diagnosed, to life-threatening conditions.

Interosseous AVMs themselves constitute a very rare condition mostly present in the craniofacial region with primary involvement of the mandible and maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【13】A 52-year-old woman presented in our neurosurgical emergency ward with severe headache accompanied by nonspecific radiating neck pain. The headache persisted for 3 days, and due to an exacerbation, the patient was admitted to the hospital.\n\n【14】Medical history revealed that the patient fell in the last few weeks due to a known right-sided hemiplegia. The physical examination did not show any sign of external injury like abrasions, hematomas, etc. The neurological physical examination showed an oriented but aphasic patient with a preexisting high-grade right-sided hemiparesis (3/5). The aforementioned hemiparesis resulted from an earlier (around 1976) hemorrhage of an AVM on the left hemisphere with accompanied intraventricular bleeding. The pupils were equal in size, reactive to light, and there was no relative afferent pupil defect. Moreover, an exophthalmus of the left eye was revealed as well as a known strabismus divergens and a facial nerve paresis on the right side. Furthermore, signs of meningeal irritation in form of a stiff and painful neck were detected. A brain computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted to investigate any intracranial pathology responsible for the headache symptoms as well as the hemiparesis. The results of the CT imaging were similar to those of 10 years ago, detecting no pathological findings. Thus, we proceeded with a cervical spine CT scan due to the accompanied cervical symptoms. The latter revealed an unstable fracture through the base of the dens, type II based on the Anderson and d’Alonzo classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There was no evidence of a spinal hematoma. Moreover, an extended osteolysis was revealed with reactive sclerosis of denses and axis’ endplate and margins, as shown in Figs 1 and 2 _._ The dens fracture was evaluated as a pathologic fracture. The fall incident could not explain the expanded osteolysis. Our assumption, based on the conducted imaging processes, is that the fracture was caused by a large AVM, which extended from the right side of the axis till the basis of the dens. The AVM also spread into the surrounding soft tissue.\n\n【15】During the hospitalization period, the neurological status of the patient remained unchanged, with persistent mobility difficulties. Taking into consideration the giant craniocervical AVM, the osteolysis of dens coupled with the decreased general condition of the patient, as well as her wish to avoid any kind of treatment, a conservative approach was chosen. The conservative treatment involved the adjustment of analgesics, a stiff neck collar for at least 6 weeks and regular application of physiotherapy.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Here, we publish a rare case of an osteolytic lesion caused by a giant AVM. Up to date, only a few case reports exist, describing a comparable condition. Our assumption is that the giant AVM gradually infiltrated the adjacent vertebral body causing osteolytic lesions over years. This assumption is based on the fact that the osteolysis was a previously unknown radiological finding of a known AVM and that the fall incident could not explain this finding. Due to the patient’s rejection of further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, an angiographic or histological confirmation of our assumption was not possible. For the same reason it was impossible to clarify the precise localization of the AVM. The lack of a comprehensive diagnostic control in order to exclude other types of osteolytic lesions, such as tumors, sets a limiting condition. Angiography remains the gold standard of depicting an AVM and cannot be replaced by the advanced imaging technique of CT.\n\n【18】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【19】The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the valuable contribution of all the clinical colleagues who contributed to the fulfillment of this work.

Sometimes, it occurs in the left ventricular (LV) subepicardial wall.\n\n【2】This study introduces a child referred to our hospital with influenza-like symptoms and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, followed by cardiac failure. However, in our subsequent evaluation, there was evidence of severe LV and RV dysfunction based on the echocardiography. Moreover, cardiac magnetic resonance showed not only the major criteria of ARVC but also those of Lake Luise seen in myocarditis. Regarding the deteriorating condition during the hospital course, he was later scheduled for heart transplantation.\n\n【3】Finally, the histopathological study of explanted heart revealed RV myocyte atrophy with the infiltration of fibrofatty tissue in myocardium diagnostic of ARVC, resolving dilemma between ARVC and myocarditis.\n\n【4】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【5】Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder that leads to predominantly right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an excellent diagnostic modality in this disease, and the pathological findings also support it significantly. This case introduces a patient who had a combination of ARVC findings and myocarditis in CMR.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】A 9-year-old boy was admitted to pediatric ward with a history of flu-like symptoms of 1-week duration followed by abdominal pain.\n\n【8】He was on methylphenidate (10 mg/day) due to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for 4 years; his past medical history was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【9】In his family history, the sudden death of a sister at the age of 17 was considerable in which she had not been evaluated.\n\n【10】In the physical examination, he was afebrile with a 90/70 mm Hg blood pressure and an average cardiac rate of 135 beats/min. His oxygen saturation was 92% with no supplemental oxygen, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min was noted.\n\n【11】Moreover, his heart rhythm was irregular due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Also, lung auscultation revealed diminished basal sounds, and abdomen bulged with positive shifting dullness but no peripheral edema. Regarding this finding, abdominal sonography was performed which indicated the significant ascites. Consequently, an abdominal tap was conducted that showed a transudative fluid.\n\n【12】The lab data revealed an elevated cardiac troponin I (~1300 ng/ml), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (15 000 pg/ml) and C-reactive protein was (22 mg/l). His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 56 mm/h. The electrolytes were normal, and so was his complete blood count. Bilateral pleural effusion was observed in chest X-ray. The evidence of sinus tachycardia, epsilon wave and bigeminy PVCs were found, but no other remarkable findings were detected on electrocardiography (ECG) . Besides, transthoracic echocardiography illustrated a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (~20%) coupled with severe RV systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, color Doppler echocardiography revealed a severe regurgitation of mitral and tricuspid valves.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】( **A** ) The 12-lead ECG shows slight sinus tachycardia, epsilon wave, and T wave inversion in V1 and ( **B** ) Holter monitoring shows frequent premature ventricular complexes.\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】( **A** ) B-SSFP image in mid short axis view shows the RV regional microaneurysm formation (yellow arrow), ( **B** ) STIR image reveals the regional myocardial edema (blue areas), ( **C** ) LGE image in SAX view indicates RV and LV apical clots (yellow arrow) and RV fibrosis (red arrow), ( **D** ) LGE image in mid-SAX view illustrates LV lateral wall subepicardial fibrosis (yellow arrowhead) and ( **E** ) LGE in axial view shows the multiple RV apical clots. B-SSFP: balanced steady-state free prerecession, SAX: short axis, STIR: short tau inversion recovery.\n\n【19】CMR revealed a dyssynchronous RV contraction, regional microaneurysm formation, as well as RV wall thinning. A significant decrease was also observed in RV EF (15%) and RV end-diastolic volume index (120 cc/m <sup>2 </sup> ), which met the major criteria of ARVC. Biventricular apical clot, active myocardial edema and fibrosis of base and mid-LV lateral wall were also identified . Based on CMR data, a precise differentiation was challenging between active myocarditis and acute phase of ARVC.\n\n【20】During hospital course, repetitive ventricular tachyarrhythmia episodes occurred , for which amiodarone and lidocaine were prescribed to suppress ventricular arrhythmia, and intravenous immunoglobulin with corticosteroid was administered with suspicion of possible myocarditis.\n\n【21】Nevertheless, because of refractory ventricular arrhythmia and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) IV, successful heart transplantation was done after 1 month despite full medical treatment. Besides, examining removed heart at transplantation was done. Moreover, in the gross pathologic specimen, RV had a thin, papered appearance. In the histologic specimens at LV lateral and septal wall, as well as RV free wall, there was evidence of fat replacement in RV free wall accompanied by myocardial fiber atrophy. Moreover, LV sections showed focal epicardial fibrosis with scant inflammation and focal myocytolysis .\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【24】( **A** ) RV specimen indicates the evidence of RV free wall fat replacement and adjacent myocardial fiber atrophy and ( **B** ) LV specimen revealed focal epicardial fibrosis and scant inflammatory cell infiltration with focal myocytolysis.\n\n【25】During a 14-month follow-up after the heart transplantation, the patient had NYHA FC = I. Endomyocardial biopsy showed no evidence of rejection, and heart catheterization revealed that RV pressure was ~20/6, mean pulmonary artery pressure = 12 mmHg, LV end-diastolic pressure of 10 mmHg and aortic pressure was ~105/60 mmHg. Moreover, the echocardiography data documented a preserved biventricular performance (LV EF = 50%, aortic velocity-time index = 16 cm, E/E′ = 10, RV ‘tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion’ = 18 cm and systolic tissue velocity of tricuspid valve annulus = 9 cm/s) with no more than mild valvular regurgitation.\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【27】This patient was a challenging case with several findings in favor of active myocarditis versus an acute phase ARVC or a combination of both.\n\n【28】In this regard, the acute clinical picture of disease with a rise in cardiac biomarker levels, LV involvement, and CMR tissue characterization findings supported the diagnosis of active myocarditis. In contrast, RV regional microaneurysm formation, severely diminished RV systolic performance in CMR coupled with RV myocardial atrophy and fibrofatty replacement in the histologic specimens were in favor of ARVC. In a case series including six pediatric patients with a genetic diagnosis of ARVC who presented by myocarditis-like symptoms, active inflammation in myocardium compatible with acute myocarditis was seen in CMR in all the cases; however, it was without any evidence of documented infection preceding this episode, except in one patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In previous case, three main hypotheses can be concluded based on clinical, imaging, histology, and lab data.\n\n【30】1.  Myocarditis superimposed on ARVC: The first hypothesis states that diseased myocardium in ARVC is more susceptible to a viral infection which results in the myocardial inflammation superimposed on ARVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】2.  Cardiotropic viruses with consequent ARVC: The second hypothesis assumes some viruses such as enterovirus and adenovirus can activate the mediators that damage the cardiac adherent junctions. Moreover, this process results in the irritability of ventricular myocardium with or without ion channel disruption and consequent ARVC symptomatology as a result of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】These cardiotropic viruses involve both ventricular myocardia with the complex cellular and adherent junction interaction, resulting in RV and LV inflammation and apoptosis that eventually induces myocardial fibrosis and remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, in a case report study by Tanawuttiwat _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, they assumed that there was a likelihood of insult from myocarditis by acquiring a desmosomal injury that eventually led to the anatomic and clinical presentations of ARVC.\n\n【33】1.  The active phase of ARVC: The third hypothesis reinforces the concept that these myocarditis-like episodes are active phases of ARVC itself. In this line, Duarte Martins _et al_ . indicated the data which ARVC could manifest as recurrent myocarditis-like episodes in the presence of myocardial inflammation evidence in CMR without an infectious trigger. They hypothesized that this presentation was an ‘active hot phase’ of disease course which might lead to disease progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】We suppose that, in our case with preceding flu-like symptoms coupled with the significant LV involvement and cardiac biomarkers rise, the first and also the second hypotheses are at the top of list. However, we cannot completely rule out the acute phase of full-blown biventricular failure due to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, especially when a family history of sudden death exists. Unfortunately, the genetic and molecular analyses were not performed for this patient and his family, due to the high price of the test.\n\n【35】Because of our case and another rare case report that has shown the relationship between acute myocarditis and ARVC, we suggest a comprehensive assessment of RV by cardiac imaging accompanied with the genetic test in the case of acute myocarditis to rule out ARVC, especially when the representing symptom is a cardiac arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【37】None.\n\n【38】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【39】None declared.\n\n【40】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【41】No financial support was received for this study.\n\n【42】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【43】We declare that we have taken a permission note from the patient parent to publish the case report.\n\n【44】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【45】Patient parents have signed an informed consent form to participate in this study.\n\n【46】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【47】Nahid Rezaeian is the guarantor of this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The child responded well to the conservative management and was discharged after 10 days. MRI was not performed due to restrictions brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the delivery and initial hospital admission. Subsequent follow-up under both paediatric otolaryngology as well as general paediatric clinics was planned.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Embryologically, the nasal grooves from the mesodermal layer are transformed into nasal pits in the first 8 weeks after conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Between the 8th and 24th week, the nasal pits are filled with epithelial tissue which then gets resorbed in normal development. Insufficient resorption of the epithelial plug leads to the formation of prominent nasal processes of the maxilla, resulting in a narrowed pyriform aperture. The reduction in the cross-section area at the pyriform aperture results in a significant increase in the resistance of the nasal passage. Consequently, the neonate needs to exert more effort for respiration.\n\n【18】By consensus, a pyriform aperture width of less than 11 mm is considered diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. CT scan of the paranasal sinuses is the most helpful modality to assess the nasal passage in neonates. First described in 1989, CNPAS can present as a sporadic anomaly or as part of solitary median maxillary central incisor syndrome (SMMCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As such, additional cross-sectional imaging (MRI) also plays an important role in identifying associated nasal anomalies (such as nasoethmoid encephaloceles), congenital brain anomalies (holoprosencephaly) and ocular defects (coloboma).\n\n【19】In our case, a routine examination by the paediatric retrieval team shortly after birth revealed signs of laboured breathing and impending respiratory distress. Routine nasal suctioning plays an important role in clearing the nasal passageway as well as providing a means of determining the presence and location of any possible airway obstruction. In CNPAS, the suction tube will invariably meet resistance after being inserted 2–4 mm into the nostrils, making further advancement impossible.\n\n【20】CNPAS should be distinguished from choanal atresia, which is the narrowing and obstruction of the posterior nasal airways by a bony or membranous septum. The clinical presentation of CNPAS and choanal atresia can be very similar as both cause subcostal recession, tachypnea and cyanosis. However, a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses provides adequate information to distinguish between the two conditions as the management approaches for each condition differ significantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Neonates with choanal atresia invariably need surgical intervention ranging from transnasal puncture, transpalatal repair, transnasal endoscopic repair and post-operative stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conversely, patients with CNPAS can be managed conservatively or with surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Conservative management is preferred when the neonate can maintain good oxygen saturation without signs of respiratory distress. In such cases, meticulous nasal hygiene and suctioning, application of adrenaline saline solution and room air humidification have shown to be effective treatment measures. Non-invasive respiratory support is given during this time and gradually tapered down. Severe CNPAS requires rhinoplasty which entails surgical widening of the nasal passage and the insertion of stents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Surgical intervention is also considered when non-invasive treatment does not help resolve the patient’s symptoms. The presence of associated craniofacial anomalies is the main cause of surgical treatment failure in approximately 14% of patients in one relatively sizeable study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. CNPAS is a condition that tends to improve as the child grows with an excellent prognosis. Even when initial surgery was inadequate, no recurrence has been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Prompt diagnosis and adequate respiratory support are crucial for neonates with CNPAS. Delay in initiating appropriate treatment puts the child at risk of respiratory distress and apnea which, in severe cases, may lead to ischemic brain injury and death. Diagnosis is made using an unenhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses with a pyriform aperture measuring less than 11 mm. Imaging also plays an important role in identifying associated craniofacial dysmorphism, which may affect treatment outcomes.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【24】We would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia for permission to publish this report.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n---------------------\n\n【26】All authors have no conflict of interests to declare.\n\n【27】FUNDING STATEMENT\n-----------------\n\n【28】All authors have no funding source to declare.\n\n【29】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【30】Not required.\n\n【31】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【32】Written consent has been obtained.\n\n【33】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【34】Dr Yong Guang Teh.\n\n【35】Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences.\n\n【36】Universiti Malaysia Sabah.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This report of two children with WHS shows that growth hormone treatment in selected children with WHS and severe short stature may have a substantial effect on long-term growth.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a rare congenital disorder occurring in approximately 1/50 000 births, with a 2 : 1 female-to-male predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It results from the hemizygous deletion encompassing the 4p16.3 region. It is estimated to be _de novo_ in 50–60% of cases, with the rest due to an unbalanced translocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This critical region of 4p16.3 has been localized to an interval of 300–600 kb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, involving genes that are believed to play an important role in DNA repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The severity of WHS is directly related to the extent of the deletion; mild WHS has a 3- to 5-Mb deletion, classic WHS has a moderate size deletion of 5–18 Mb, and severe WHS is seen with deletions >22 Mb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The typical craniofacial phenotype is described as a ‘Greek warrior helmet appearance’ with hypertelorism, a prominent glabella, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly and micrognathia. Classically, children with WHS show developmental delay with hypotonia and seizures, with marked pre- and postnatal growth retardation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Given the often extreme short stature, children with WHS would be potentially eligible for treatment with exogenous growth hormone (GH) in many countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We report the response to GH in childhood of two unrelated cases without GH deficiency.\n\n【5】CASE 1\n------\n\n【6】Case 1 was born from non-consanguineous parents (mid-parental height 75th percentile) at 36 weeks, and birth weight of 1745 kg (−2.7 SDS). She had ongoing poor growth, moderate developmental delay and developed generalized seizures at the age of 18 months, and started on anti-convulsants. Investigations included normal karyotype (46XX), GH testing (peak GH 35 µg/l; normal >7 µg/l) and unremarkable metabolic evaluation. Microarray confirmed a 3.7-Mb deletion in the region of 4p16.2-p16.3. She had absent middle phalanges of the third and fifth toes bilaterally. At 3.5 years of age, her height was −4.6 SDS, BMI −4.0 SDS and siting height −5.1 SDS, with a bone age of 1.2 years. GH was started at 4 years of age , and was associated with increased height to −3.5 and −2.5 SDS after 1 and 2 years, respectively, and at 9.5 years, −1.64 SDS (5th percentile). GH was stopped by the parents at 9.5 years; this was followed by a marked deceleration of growth.\n\n【7】Figure 1:\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Height during GH therapy in Case 1, blue boxes represent bone age.\n\n【10】CASE 2\n------\n\n【11】Case 2 was born from non-consanguineous parents (mid-parental height 50%) at 36 weeks, and birth weight of 1867 kg (−2.1 SDS). She had a single kidney on ultrasound and a cleft palate. She had ongoing poor growth and was gastrostomy fed at 2 years of age with little effect on growth. She developed moderate developmental delay and also generalized seizures at ∼18 months, and started on anti-convulsants. Investigations included normal karyotype (46XX), GH testing (peak GH 15 µg/l) and general screen. WHS was confirmed with a FISH probe showing a 4p16.3 deletion. Her father had a balanced translocation t(4;14). At 2.6 years of age, her height was −3.4 SDS and BMI −4.8 SDS. She had facial features of WHS and a bone age of 2.0 years. GH was started at 3.3 years of age , and was associated with an increase in height to −2.5 and –2.1 SDS after 1 and 2 years, respectively. At 6.8 years of age, her height is −2.1 SDS.\n\n【12】Figure 2:\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Height during GH therapy in Case 2, blue boxes represent bone age.\n\n【15】There have been no complications of GH treatment and no increase in seizures in either case.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】Children with idiopathic short stature and poor growth in New Zealand are eligible for publically funded treatment with GH in the same dose as used in these cases. In a systematic audit of non-syndromic, GH-sufficient children, the median increase for height was +0.46 SDS (interquartile range 0.19, 0.76) in the first year of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The present two cases show that GH treatment of WHS in childhood can achieve a similar or potentially even greater acceleration of growth. Indeed, Case 1 showed continuing improvement in height into the normal range. Although there is one published case of WHS suggesting possible partial GH deficiency, with a borderline GH level (peak GH 7.8 ng/ml and normal for laboratory >10 ng/ml) with a low IGF-1 level (35 µg/l) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, in both the present cases, GH responses were unequivocally normal.\n\n【18】These cases add to the very limited published experience, suggesting that GH therapy for WHS is associated with sustained acceleration of growth during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9–11 \\]</u>. We were able to identify only one previous case for which the response was described in detail. In that case that had normal GH testing and low normal level of IGF-1. She was treated with GH from 6 years of age for 4 years, her height increased from −5.3 SDS to −1.8 SDS. However, her predicted adult height only increased by 4 cm to 153.1 due to skeletal maturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This response is highly similar in case 1.\n\n【19】In conclusion, these cases suggest that, in selected children with WHS and severe short stature, GH therapy may have a substantial effect on long-term growth.\n\n【20】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【21】None declared.\n\n【22】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【23】We wish to gratefully acknowledge the families of these two cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

He had no recent sick contacts, dietary changes or travel outside the USA. He had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena or hematochezia. On exam, his abdomen was soft and non-tender. Laboratory studies were notable for a white blood cell count of 4.13 K/μl, a CD4 count of 35 and an HIV-1 viral load of 265 000 copies/ml. An abdominal X-ray was consistent with a partial small bowel obstruction.

An increased risk of intussusception has been reported among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), although the true incidence is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This increased susceptibility to intussusception is due to a high incidence of infectious and neoplastic conditions of the bowel that increase the risk of developing a pathologic lead point. In particular, mesenteric lymphadenopathy is common among patients with AIDS from conditions such as lymphoma, tuberculosis, other mycobacterial infections and Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Although the most common aetiology for the development of CAE and CAA has been found to be atherosclerosis, there have been few reports of CAE cases associated with CAA. We report a rare case of CAE and a large CAA, which is unparalleled among the reported cases.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 69-year-old woman presented with ischemic changes in the inferior lead , as noted on electrocardiography during a medical check-up. The patient underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate ischaemia and was found to have a coronary aneurysm, and chest radiography showed a protruding coronary aneurysm . Coronary computed tomography angiography showed right coronary artery (RCA) ectasia associated with a giant aneurysm originating from the distal RCA . The diameters of the ectasia and aneurysm were 15 and 70 mm, respectively. Coronary angiography showed no stenosis or dilatation in the left coronary artery , whereas the right CAE was observed along its entire length . A giant CAA was also observed . She was asymptomatic and exhibited no risk factors, including Kawasaki disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or family history. CAA was so large that an aneurysmectomy was performed to prevent rupture. The aneurysm and CAE  were exposed to cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass performed through a median sternotomy. The aneurysmal wall was incised, and the inflow hole was confirmed with antegrade cardioplegia. There was neither an outflow nor fistula in the aneurysm. The inflow hole was closed with a pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene mattress suture inside the aneurysm without closing the coronary artery distal to the RCA . The aneurysmal sac was then punctured. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm revealed degeneration due to atherosclerosis . A coronary CT scan showed no inflow into the CAA postoperatively . The patient was prescribed warfarin and aspirin for the prevention of thrombus in the dilated coronary arteries in the CAE to prevent myocardial infarction. The patient is still recovering without any postoperative complications and is doing well as an outpatient.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】The electrocardiogram at the time of admission shows negative T waves in 2, 3 and aVf inductions.\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Chest radiography shows aneurysm as protruding mass.\n\n【12】Figure 3\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】(A) The CAE is seen (①).

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to save patients. However, until now, there has been no consensus on the optimal strategy for the treatment of CAE and CAA due to a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials or official guidelines. The optimal strategy should be individualized, based on the size and morphology of the aneurysms and associated lesions, for each patient. In this case, since this patient did not have any symptoms, coronary ectasia and a huge aneurysm were incidentally found with electrocardiogram during a medical check-up. Because the size of the aneurysm was enormous and the risk of rupture was high, we performed surgical resection of the aneurysm. As the aneurysm was located in the peripheral RCA, we did not perform coronary artery bypass grafting. Atherosclerosis is considered the common etiologic factor responsible for CAE in adults, whereas Kawasaki disease is the most common cause in children and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient did not have a history of Kawasaki disease, and the histopathological results of the ectasia and aneurysms showed degeneration due to atherosclerosis. However, there were no risk factors for atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic lesions in other coronary arteries. There have also been reports of coronary aneurysms that developed after the primary coronary artery dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although CAA usually develops with sudden chest pain, such as acute coronary syndrome, and has a high fatality rate, it is possible that in our patient, this disease occurred asymptomatically, and the tunica media subsequently became vulnerable and formed a coronary aneurysm.\n\n【33】CAE is still present in this case. The presence of CAE predicts future cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Doi _et al._ suggested that acute myocardial infarction patients with CAE are a high-risk subset who might benefit from a pharmacological approach to control the coagulation cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Concomitant use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications should be used with caution because they increase the risk of bleeding events, but they may be effective in preventing myocardial infarction.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】None declared.\n\n【36】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【37】The studies have received an approval from our institutional ethics review board.\n\n【38】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【39】All study participants provided informed consent.\n\n【40】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【41】Takanori Hishikawa.\n\n【42】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【43】The comments provided by Associate Editor and two anonymous reviewers greatly improved the clarity of the manuscript.

As part of our first assignments with Médecins Sans Frontières, we, as pediatricians, participated in fieldwork for a 6-month period each in 2018. The project was based in a conflict setting in northeastern Syria. During this time, we were responsible for overseeing the medical treatment for pediatric patients in both a hospital and community settings. Part of our duties was to provide medical care for a cohort of patients living with thalassemia, an autosomal recessive, transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathy. There is a baseline high carrier rate of thalassemia among the Syrian population. In this thalassemia clinic, we cared for over 200 patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. Their essential treatments of safe blood transfusion and appropriate iron chelation therapy had been interrupted due to the conflict. Many patients suffered from complications of iron overload; including cardiac toxicity, delayed growth and puberty and hepatic dysfunction. Although there was inadequate laboratory diagnostics available, some of our patients also displayed symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus secondary to their complex medical conditions. Furthermore, we observed a high rate of hepatitis C infection and some cases of hepatitis B within our patient cohort, thought to be due to unsafe blood transfusion during the height of the conflict. Although progress was made during our time spent working in the department and significant developments made with patient care guidelines, we feel that there is still room to improve practice to further optimize patient care for this vulnerable cohort in this resource-limited setting. Challenges included limitations in accessing care due to a lack of safe and reliable transportation to thalassemia clinic, as well as complexities in the sociocultural perceptions on HIV testing, the significant psychological morbidity as a result of living in an area of protracted conflict and the provision of care for a complex chronic illness in this resource-limited setting. Documentation of the situation and challenges is necessary to learn and improve practice and to ultimately result in improved patient care and clinical outcomes. We hope that the _Oxford Medical Case Reports_ will contribute to increasing the available knowledge base through the submission of papers by medical staff in humanitarian settings sharing their experiences and challenges with the provision care for people living with complex medical conditions in similar resource-limited settings.\n\n【1】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【2】None declared.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

His visual acuity was 20/20 in the affected eye. His pupillary exam was unremarkable without an obvious afferent pupillary defect. His intraocular pressures were 15 and 19 mmHg (right and left eyes, respectively). Slit lamp exam of the right eye revealed a corneal epithelial defect with an associated stromal defect. Although Seidel testing initially revealed a possible small aqueous leak near the wound apex, this was not appreciated ~1 hour later. Anterior chamber depths were relatively similar between both eyes. The patient was diagnosed with a partial thickness corneal wound of the right eye and Moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution was initiated. A bandage contact lens (BCL) was also placed over the right cornea. An anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) (OCT; Heidelberg Spectralis®) revealed the tangential partial thickness laceration Figure 1 ). The patient healed well with the continuation of Moxifloxacin. Treatment varies based on wound characteristics for partial-thickness corneal lacerations. A pressure patch and topical antibiotics may suffice if wound edges are well apposed. The advantages of using a BCL are to protect the wound against eyelid movement and promote re-epithelialization.

The point is to understand’.\n\n【1】Albert Einstein.\n\n【2】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sneakily entered our lives early on in 2020 and the adverse health effects associated with it continue. We now understand more about the virus and about how to manage patients. Large-scale studies have been initiated across the globe and one provided an ally in our fight against COVID-19 in an old fashioned drug, dexamethasone reducing mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Others showed reduction in hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> or simply reinforced the safety of continuing medications during COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We have also realized how catastrophic the virus can be. We learned that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which causes COVID-19, enters the cells using Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. These receptors are found abundantly not only in the pulmonary but also other organ systems such as the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Consequently, extra-pulmonary effects of COVID-19 are not at all surprising. With an increasing number of cases and a forthcoming second wave infection, clinicians must be aware of these multisystem manifestations. In this article, we aim to discuss the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the respiratory and some of the other major organ systems in the human body.\n\n【3】RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\n------------------\n\n【4】The principal manifestation of COVID-19 is in the lungs, where respiratory failure is a leading cause of death.

Gross lung findings include patchy to diffuse consolidation, severe interstitial congestion, and thromboembolism while histology demonstrates hyaline membranes, extensive capillary congestion, and microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, consistent with exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) . Whilst aforementioned findings resemble those found in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19-associated ARDS displays a peculiar phenotype owing to dissociation between severity of hypoxaemia and relative maintenance of lung mechanics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】_Post mortem_ examination of COVID-19 patients reveals diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction; microscopic lung findings: ( **A** ) Exudative DAD showing discrete hyaline membranes and prominent capillary congestion; ( **B** ) syncytial cells of pneumocyte II origin; ( **C** ) Extensive capillary congestion without DAD; ( **D** ) Microthrombi in alveolar capillaries; image reproduced from Menter _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> under the terms of the creative commons attribution license\n\n【9】Despite COVID-19-associated ARDS meeting the criteria, it has been proposed that patients developing it could be categorized into type 1 ‘non-ARDS’ and type 2 ‘ARDS’ depending on lung compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Distinction between them can be made based on computed tomography (CT) scans  or, albeit substandard, response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Type 1 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with reasonable lung compliance while type 2 patients exhibit severe hypoxaemia with poor lung compliance. This has important clinical implications when deciding management in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n【10】**Figure 2**\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】In these two patients, following variables were recorded: Type 1 lung weight (1192 g), gas volume (2774 ml), percentage of non-aerated tissue (8.4%), venous admixture (56%), P/F 通用删除7(英):<u>(68)</u> and respiratory system compliance (80 ml/cmH <sub>2 </sub> O); Type 2 lung weight (1441 g), gas volume (1640 ml), percentage of non-aerated tissue (39%), venous admixture (49%), P/F 通用删除7(英):<u>(61)</u> and respiratory system compliance (43 ml/cmH <sub>2 </sub> O).

Rashes appeared either before (9%) or after (11%) hospitalization and were described as erythematous, widespread urticarial or resembling chickenpox. Since then skin manifestations have been classified, most comprehensively, in a cross-sectional study of 375 patients with COVID-19 and cutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The five groups identified were (i) pseudo-chilblain lesions, i.e. acral areas of erythema–oedema with some vesicles or pustules 通用删除1(英):<u>(19%, Fig. 6a and b )</u>, (ii) other vesicular eruptions 通用删除1(英):<u>(9%, Fig. 6c )</u>, (iii) urticarial lesions 通用删除1(英):<u>(19%, Fig. 6d )</u>, (iv) other maculopapules 通用删除1(英):<u>(47%, Fig. 7a–c )</u> and (v) livedo or necrosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(6%, Fig. 7d )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Eruptions occurred before (6%), at the same time (57%), or after (37%) the onset of other symptoms and the type of lesion was associated with age and disease severity, both increasing from Group 1 to Group 5. In this study, patients received a variety of drug treatments and not all skin manifestations may therefore be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. For example, hydroxychloroquine may cause skin reactions including the rare Stevens-Johnson Syndrome presenting with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular eruption that rapidly spreads from distal extremities  to the whole body with orolabial and genital mucosal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.

From 2014 to 2020 we diagnosed four patients with spontaneous reattachment of RRD. We conducted a review of the relevant medical records, focusing on the initial symptoms at presentation, the initial diagnoses, with a further observation of the patients next 3 years. The patients were re-examined 3 years later after cases of spontaneous reattachment of RRD. Three years after a case of spontaneous reattachment of RRD during reexamination in four patients (four eyes), redetachment was not detected. The mentioned clinical cases indicate the possibility of finding new approaches to RRD management.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a progressive state requiring surgical intervention aimed to block retinal tears (RT) and remove vitreoretinal traction. It is known that surgery is the sole management of RRD and must be performed immediately. Scleral buckling and vitrectomy are targeted to block RT and reduce vitreoretinal traction with retinal reattachment as a potential outcome. As far as literature review shows, undiagnosed RRD or delay in surgery may result with spontaneous reattachment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (SRRRD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】### Case No. 1\n\n【6】A 45-year-old female noted a sudden loss of vision on the right eye (OD) a month ago. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was incorrect light projection OD and 20/200 in the left eye (OS); low visual acuity OS caused by myopic maculopathy. Dilated fundus examination (DFE) OD revealed posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and RRD in three quadrants with retinal folds and RT at 12:00 and 1:00 o’clock at the periphery. Vitreoretinal surgery was offered to the patient. One month later, SRRRD was diagnosed  and retinal laser coagulation (RLC) was performed around RT. One week later, BCVA OD was correct light projection; another week later, it became 20/4000.

The patient had diabetic retinopathy, a proliferative stage with maculopathy. BCVA was 20/4000 OS and 20/50 OD; low visual acuity OD caused by diabetic macular edema. DFE OS revealed PVD with RRD in two upper quadrants involving the macula with RT at 12:30, 6:00 and 9:00 o’clock. Vitreoretinal surgery was offered to the patient. A month later, SRRRD was diagnosed  and RLC over RT was performed. DFE OS revealed macular edema, multiple microaneurysms and microhemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, neovascularization, laser spots on periphery.

However, they pointed out that detached retina with vitreous traction and fixed retinal folds showed an insignificant tendency toward spontaneous reattachment.\n\n【38】De Jong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> concluded that limiting head and eye movements is enough to prevent RRD progression, but it should not be counted as an only contributing factor to SRRRD; the authors supposed that the gravitational force effect on the retina and subretinal fluid is small because of the no density difference between them.\n\n【39】Some studies have suggested that the basis for the development of SRRRD presumably involves the occurrence of a complete PVD that in most cases relieves vitreoretinal traction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Inflammatory response to RT in addition to RRD triggers microglial and Müller cells migration and their massive proliferation at the vitreoretinal interface to establish a glial scar that closes RT and, in our opinion, facilitates developing SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> suggested that, after a partial PVD that relieves vitreoretinal traction, vitreous fibers running parallel to the retinal plane may close RT and interrupt the fluid inflow; in another words, the occurrence of PVD with a consequent RT plugging; subsequently, RPE removes residual subretinal fluid by active transport and/or by Starling force (the balance between capillary pressure, interstitial pressure, and osmotic pressure) that is conducive to SRRRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】In our study patients were not limited in head and eye movement or neither in a bed position, they had various types of RT, one patient had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, one patient had no PVD; the clinical variability of the SRRRD may contradicts studies above.\n\n【41】There were several limitations in our study. First, the limited number of the cases and retrospective nature of this study. Second, all patients were not comprehensively examined by imaging tools with focus imaging of RT and detachment before SRRRD to determine the pathogenesis of SRRRD. We recognize and do not undermine the importance of vitreoretinal surgery in RRD; we strongly recommended surgery to all our patients.\n\n【42】To summarize, SRRRD is a rare event in ophthalmologist’s practice, accumulating case reports may provide significant information in understanding the current phenomenon. In certain cases, persistent reattachment of the retina after RRD without any intervention is possible. The mentioned clinical cases indicate the possibility of finding new approaches to RRD management.\n\n【43】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【44】Not applicable.

Here, we report a case of keratitis caused by multi-drug-resistant _S. algae_ that was not related to a marine environment.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 66-year-old man was sent to the emergency department from a nursing hospital because of desaturation. He had been hospitalized for more than 2 years in an unconscious state due to a cervical spine injury. He was unable to close his eyes voluntarily. Neither the patient nor his family had a history of marine exposure. At admission, pneumonia was suspected, and conjunctival injection, purulent discharge and central white opacity were detected in his right eye. He was admitted to the respiratory department, and treatment with piperacillin–tazobactam was started for pneumonia. An ophthalmologist examined the patient at the bedside. Examination of his right eye revealed 6.0 × 5.0 mm corneal opacity and hyphema with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination was impossible due to corneal haziness. Corneal swabs were sent for Gram staining, bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing, KOH mount smear and fungal culture. Empirical treatment with tobramycin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin eye drops was started. The KOH smear and Gram stain were negative. After a 2-day incubation, medium-sized gray and dark pink colonies grew on blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . Other types of colony did not grow on the plate. _S. algae_ was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Vitek system (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). 16S rRNA sequencing revealed 99.93% (1410/1411 bp) identity with _S. algae_ JCM 21037(T) (GenBank accession number BALO01000089 ). Susceptibility testing of the isolate indicated susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, colistin and gentamicin, resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and intermediate to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and meropenem. We added steroid eye drops to control the inflammation and continued the antibiotic eye drops. After 14 days, his keratitis had improved.\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】_Shewanella algae_ colonies grown on chocolate (left) and blood (right) agar plates.\n\n【10】Table 1\n\n【11】Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n【14】Open in new tab\n\n【15】Table 1\n\n【16】Eye infections caused by _Shewanella_ species\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n| Year . | Age . | Sex . | Species . | Clinical manifestation . | Underlying condition . | Marine exposure . | Country . | Reference number . |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | 58 | M | _Shewanella putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | s/p LASIK | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> |\n| 2013 | 27 | M | _Shewanella algae_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma during fishing | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> |\n| 2014 | 25 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Endophthalmitis | None | Trauma with a fishhook | India | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. putrefaciens_ | Keratitis | None | None | Korea | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> |\n| 2019 | 75 | M | _S. algae_ | Keratitis | Chronic dry eye syndrome, glaucoma | None | USA | 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> |\n\n【19】Open in new tab\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【21】Microbial keratitis is inflammation of the cornea caused by bacteria, fungi, or protists. The main causative bacteria are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Serratia_ species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Bacterial keratitis caused by _Shewanella_ species is extremely rare. Only one case of _S. algae_ infection has been reported worldwide; this was in the USA in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In Korea, there has been one case of _S. algae_ endophthalmitis but no reported keratitis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We report the second case of _S. algae_ keratitis worldwide and the first in Asia. Colonies of _Shewanella_ species on medium are convex, circular, and smooth and produce an unusual brown to tan pigment, in contrast to the white colonies of the major keratitis pathogens _S. aureus_ and _P. aeruginosa_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The colonies we observed were also medium-sized circular smooth colonies that were dark pink to brown on both blood agar plate and chocolate agar plate . This should inform clinicians of the unusual colony morphology, which differs from that of the major keratitis pathogens observed in clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\n【22】This case has two exceptional aspects. First, the isolate was resistant to multiple drugs. There are no criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of _Shewanella_ species in international guidelines, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Therefore, we used the criteria for _P. aeruginosa_ , which is a related strain. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenem and intermediate to quinolone, which shows more resistant tendency than previous reported isolates. In a 2013 review of 239 cases since 1973, 82%, 94%, 94% and 98% of _Shewanella_ species were susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, _S. algae_ was multi-drug resistant, rendering it difficult to treat, which can lead to treatment failure. Furthermore, the types of antibiotics that can be used in eye drops are limited, decreasing the treatment options.\n\n【23】Second, the patient had no history of seawater exposure. _Shewanella_ infections are often associated with marine exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Our patient had been hospitalized in a nursing hospital for more than 2 years, and his family had no relation to the sea. Consequently, we did not suspect _S. algae_ infection in this patient sooner. It is necessary to consider whether there are _S. algae_ infection routes other than marine exposure. We did not perform other culture such as stool culture, therefore it was not possible to confirm that _S. algae_ existed in the patient as colonization. Although _S. algae_ mainly inhabit the marine environment, there is a possibility of infection even if the patient did not have marine exposure. _S. algae_ is found naturally in wildlife including seawater as well as soil, fish, meat, and dairy product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There have been several cases of eye infections without marine exposure in previously published reports . Although no other investigation has been conducted to find the source of the infection, it should be thought that various environment including care giving staff and ingestion of seafood also can be the sources of infection.\n\n【24】As in this case, clinical isolates can be extremely rare species with high levels of drug resistance and can involve an atypical patient history. For best clinical practice, clinicians need to keep an eye on the laboratory results after ordering cultures.\n\n【25】This is the second report of bacterial keratitis caused by multi-drug resistant _S. algae_ worldwide and the first in Asia. Clinicians must track microbiology test results to determine appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【26】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n---------------------\n\n【29】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【30】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【31】This research did not receive specific funding.\n\n【32】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【33】No approval was required for the case report from the local ethical committee.\n\n【34】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【35】Consent was obtained in written format from the patient’s family for clinical information to be reported in the journal.\n\n【36】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【37】J.C. and J.E.S.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is possible that the terminal ileum and the cecum were not observed only by confirming the ileocecal valve. We experienced a case in which DLBCL pierced the gastrointestinal tract to form an ileocecal fistula, ‘a pseudo-ileocecal valve’. He underwent ileocecal resection.

Here, we report the first case that describes the occurrence of primary splenic T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma in a patient with a previous diagnosis of recurrent hairy cell leukemia. A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia in 1996 and achieved complete remission with Pentostatin.

However, up to our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the development of primary splenic THRLBCL in a patient who was previously diagnosed with recurrent HCL.\n\n【4】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【5】A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in 1996 following symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections and easy bruising. Complete remission was achieved with Pentostatin. In 2015, he developed malaise, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow (75%), with focal infiltration by groups of large cells with clear eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei with perinuclear halos contain variable chromatin, and rare mitosis figures without prominent nucleoli were observed. There was a moderate increase in reticulin fibers . A mouse monoclonal IgG1 κ Hairy for the Dako immunohistochemistry was used. Bone marrow immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD20 and hairy cell antibodies \\[Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)\\] on large cells . Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was negative. The histopathological picture and immunohistochemistry findings confirmed the relapse of HCL. We achieved complete remission with Cladribine. The patient continued to do well until June 2016, when he was admitted to our hospital with a history of B-symptoms. Vital signs were within normal range. Clinical examination revealed grade I in-depth and II in-extension lower limbs with edema and a palpable spleen, 12 cm below the costal edge. The patient could not afford the high cost of flow cytometry, so we used antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】The bone marrow biopsy sections reveal infiltration by a group of large cells contains clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear halo (arrow head). Nuclei with variable chromatin, rare mitosis figures and focal bone marrow fibrosis were observed. No prominent nucleoli were noticed (×100).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】The section of bone marrow shows positivity of Hairy cell antibody on large cells (Anti-Hairy Antibodies (1/24)).\n\n【12】The patient was presumed to have a new relapse of HCL as the new bone marrow biopsy was normal. In addition, we found no plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, which excludes the blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia. An abdominal ultrasound showed a massive homogenous splenomegaly (26 × 16) cm. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral blood smear exhibited some anisocytosis with a few tear-shaped red cells and a significant decrease in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelet counts. Echocardiography exposed preserved Ejection Fraction (EF) and mild regurgitation in the mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves with no significant gradient. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray (CXR) were within normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed homogenous splenomegaly (26.3× 16) cm, without other abnormalities. We transferred the patient to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic splenectomy due to suspicion of hypersplenism and without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【13】Gross examination showed massive splenomegaly . The spleen was cut into two segments measuring (24× 9× 8) cm and (22× 9× 8.5) cm . Microscopic examination using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) revealed splenic tissue infiltrated by monoclonal, large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei . Immunohistochemistry evaluation results were positive for CD20 on large cells , CD3 on some of the background small lymphocytes , CD15  and CD45. However, it was negative for CD30 and hairy cell staining. To exclude the possibility of blastic transformation of hairy cell leukemia, we performed additional staining for Annexin A1 , TRAP  and CD103  in a private histology laboratory, which all became negative. Staining for CD22 and CD25 was not available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103. These results confirmed the diagnosis of T-cell rich B cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematology-oncology department to receive chemotherapy. The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP. The patient had an uneventful follow-up until Feb 2021, when we lost the follow-up with him for unknown reasons.\n\n【14】Figure 3\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】A) gross examination reveals a huge splenomegaly.

HCL typically occurs in middle-aged men presenting with pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Morphologically, it is characterized by typical hairy cells with irregular, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cytoplasmic projections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7–10 \\]</u>. HCL, hairy cell leukemia—variant (HCL-v) and splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma may have cytoplasmic projections. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate HCL from other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. HCL expresses TRAP and stains positive for annexin A1, cyclin D1, CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123. HCL also negatively stains CD5, CD23 and CD10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Although HCL-v could be TRAP-positive, CD25, cyclin D1 and annexin A1 are characteristically absent. Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (previously diagnosed as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes) lacks annexin A1, CD5, CD25, CD103 and CD11c 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. To exclude the blastic transformation of HCL in our case, we performed staining Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103, which all became negative. However, staining for CD22 and CD25 was not\n\n【34】available in our country; therefore, we made the final diagnosis based on the positivity of CD3, CD15, CD20 and CD45 and the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103.\n\n【35】T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell Lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a new clinicopathological entity. It was first described in 1988. It constitutes almost 0.1% of all lymphomas. It is rare to encounter THRLBCL as a primary lymphoma in the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The WHO classification of lymphomas included THRLBCL as a specific histologic subtype of DLBCL; and reserved its diagnosis for cases in which the large B-cell component accounts for 10% or less of tumor cells, surrounded by a majority population of small polyclonal T cells, with or without histiocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The available knowledge about THRLBCL is scarce and mainly derived from published cases and case series. This subtype often has aggressive clinical behavior. Therefore, patients often present in advanced stages with splenomegaly and bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemical staining for B-cells is always positive for CD20 and CD45, whereas there is a rarity of the positivity of CD30. More than 50% of cases are positive for BCL-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The occurrence of a second malignancy with HCL synchronously or subsequently has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The most extensive study on this topic reported second cancer among 3104 patients with HCL and concluded that patients with HCL are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia and thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Many theories were suggested to explain this phenomenon, the shared genetic predisposition, environmental exposure to carcinogens and immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Pentostatin or cladribine remains the standard first-line treatment of HCL and could achieve cure rates of 70–90%. However, a complete cure with purine analog therapy is uncertain as patients are still at risk for relapse after an average of 15–16 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. On the other hand, Rituximab therapy showed cure rates of 10–54%, while a combination of purine analog and Rituximab could achieve cure rates of 88–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 14 \\]</u>. However, the latter is associated with increased immunosuppression, toxicities and second malignancies from purine analogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 13 \\]</u>. Moreover, the splenectomy could worsen immunity and allow for mutations and subsequent transformation of HCL into a more severe neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】The patient, in this case, has undergone diagnostic/therapeutic splenectomy due to splenic recurrence of HCL. Splenectomy is a well-described part of HCL treatment that helps to enhance hematologic parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Surprisingly, the biopsy revealed the presence of THRLBCL as the malignancy in the spleen. Moreover, the flow cytometry came TRAP negative and HCL staining negative. However, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether the presence of TRCBCL was a coincidence or whether there is a causal relationship between the two malignancies. In our case, we rely on the negativity of Annexin A1, TRAP and CD103 to exclude the blastic transformation of HCL.\n\n【38】In conclusion, hairy cell leukemia is an indolent, chronic lymphoproliferative malignancy. It is common to develop a second malignancy in this leukemia, attributed to several theories. However, THRLBCL is rare as primary splenic involvement and a second malignancy after HCL. Second malignancies should be considered, whether symptoms relapsed or new ones developed in patients who previously had neoplasm, especially HCL. However, we recommend close monitoring for early detection of possible new malignancies in HCL patients.\n\n【39】ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n---------------\n\n【40】Pathology department for helping with sample analysis.\n\n【41】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【42】No conflict of interest.\n\n【43】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【44】There were no sources of funding.\n\n【45】ETHICS APPROVAL\n---------------\n\n【46】This study was approved by Damascus University.\n\n【47】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【48】The patient provided written informed consent for publication of his clinical details and images.\n\n【49】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【50】HA and TA are the guarantor of this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We performed early and prompt reperfusion and were able to save the patient without any complications. A wrap-around LAD perfuses a large myocardial area; therefore, this type of coronary occlusion causes severe myocardial damage and has a poor prognosis. The rates of new-onset heart failure and heart failure rehospitalization are also high. Simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevations on electrocardiography suggest acute myocardial infarction with a wrap-around LAD lesion, which requires prompt revascularization. More careful medications for heart failure and follow-up should be also required even after discharge in such case.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Generally, left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion results in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Inferior leads are reciprocal to precordial leads; therefore, simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation in myocardial infarction is rare. Here, we describe inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction due to a large wrap-around LAD occlusion.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 50-year-old man had sudden chest pain. One hour later, he was admitted to our emergency department. The patient’s past medical history included hyperuricemia, ureterolithiasis and current smoking. On admission, his blood pressure was 98/58 mmHg; pulse rate, 51 beats/min and oxygen saturation, 96% (mask, 3 L). The patient had no murmurs or respiratory rales and was experiencing cold sweats. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V2-6  along with complete right-bundle branch block (CRBBB). Echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with anteroseptal and inferior wall motion abnormalities. Initially, we expected simultaneous occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and LAD. Emergency coronary angiography (CAG) showed proximal LAD occlusion , a normal left circumflex artery and a small RCA . Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the LAD was performed. The thrombus was aspirated using an aspiration catheter (Thrombuster, KANEKA, Japan) after wire crossing. An everolimus-eluting stent (EES: 3.5 × 18 mm) was placed. During the procedure, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation. We performed defibrillation four times, and his ECG returned to sinus rhythm. CAG after successful stenting revealed large LAD wrapping around the apex to the inferior wall . Immediately after PCI, we inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for continuation of cardiac shock. The door-to-balloon time was approximately 40 min. While creatinine kinase (CK) levels peaked at 12 079 U/L (normal: 40–200 U/L), CK-MB peaked at 220 U/L (normal: <25 U/L). The patient’s postoperative course was favorable. On day 3 post admission, the IABP was removed for hemodynamic stabilization. Heart failure did not develop during hospitalization. On day 11 postadmission, the patient was discharged without complications. He was able to return to work. After 3 years, CAG revealed no restenosis , and ECG showed disappearance of the CRBBB and improvement in ST-segment elevation . Echocardiography revealed residual anteroseptal wall motion abnormalities; however, the ejection fraction was restored to 64%. During the several years following treatment, the patient experienced no further cardiovascular events.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Admission ECG showing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V2-6  along with CRBBB (black arrow).\n\n【9】Figure 2\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】( **A** ) Initial CAG showing proximal LAD occlusion (red arrow).

CAG revealed an occlusion of only the LAD, which ran around the apex to the inferior wall and perfused both the inferior and anterior myocardium. An LAD that perfuses at least one-fourth of the inferior left ventricular wall in the right cranial oblique, is known as a wrap-around LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Bozbeyoğlu _et al_ . reported 88 patients (34.3%) with wrap-around LAD and 29 patients (11.5%) with ST-elevation in inferior leads among 259 patients with anterior AMI. Among the 29 patients, 13 patients (44.8%) had distal occlusion of wrap-around LAD, which was related to the cause of anterior AMI with ST-elevation in inferior leads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It results in a minor anterior myocardial injury, small reciprocal inferior ST-change and inferior myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although CAG revealed proximal occlusion of LAD in this case, the ECG of our patient revealed both inferior and precordial ST-segment elevation. This was a relatively rare case, and we considered the following: the patient had a small RCA and thus, LAD perfused a significant portion of the inferior myocardium. There was a larger change of the ST-elevation than that of ST-depression inferior segments. This type of LAD perfuses a larger portion of the myocardium; therefore, wrap-around LAD occlusion may result in severe myocardial damage compared with that of non-wrap-around LAD occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Kobayashi _et al._ reported a high mortality and morbidity in patients with occluded wrap-around LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The rates of new-onset heart failure and heart failure rehospitalization are also high. Medications should be managed and careful follow-up is required, even after discharge. Our patient’s ECG also showed CRBBB, which resulted from an anterior myocardial infarction involving the interventricular septum. Wong _et al_ . reported that the right-bundle branch traverses the intraventricular septum toward the cardiac apex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this case, the occluded lesion was proximal to a large septal branch. We considered that the proximal wrap-around LAD occlusion resulted in ischemia of the septum and the right-bundle branch and development of CRBBB. A poor prognosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with CRBBB has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The patient was saved due to early and prompt reperfusion. The possibility of wrap-around LAD lesions in simultaneous inferior and precordial ST-segment elevations should be considered. Large infarct area and high incidence of heart failure indicate a poor prognosis. Clinicians should note the need for rapid reperfusion and more careful medication for heart failure in such cases.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n---------------\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】DATA AVAILABILITY\n-----------------\n\n【26】All relevant data are within the manuscript.\n\n【27】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【28】No conflicts of interest.\n\n【29】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【30】None.\n\n【31】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【32】Ethics approval for this single-case analysis was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Tokushima Red Cross Hospital.\n\n【33】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【34】The study was published with written consent of the patient.\n\n【35】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【36】Hiroto Tamura, MD (corresponding author).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Stable formation of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to particular onconeural antigens occurs in the majority of cases, whereas persistent coexistence of antibodies specific for multiple onconeural antigens is a relatively rare phenomenon of certain malignant tumors like small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We here describe onconeural antigen spreading in a 70-year-old Caucasian male with PND due to SCLC. Onconeural antigen spreading may be promoted by two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms: (i) a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself and (ii) a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens. This illustrates a potential dissociation between peripheral anti-tumoral immunity and central anti-neural immunity during the course of PND.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Cellular and humoral immunity towards distinct onconeural antigens is the hallmark of PNDs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Nerve conduction studies revealed severe demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy fulfilling the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Initial MRI of the brain and entire spinal cord showed moderate contrast enhancement in fibers of the cauda equine an radices only (not shown). Cerebral (as part of a whole-body) FDG-PET/CT was normal . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation (cell count of 0/μl; protein 1003 mg/l; albumin ratio 18.4 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ) and presence of elevated fractions of activated HLADR <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD138 <sup>+ </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> plasma cells  without intrathecal Ig-synthesis or oligoclonal bands (type 1 pattern). The detection of serum onconeural anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies together with the long history of smoking  prompted a detailed tumor search especially for SCLC. Chest-CT showed atelectasis of the middle pulmonary lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, whole-body FDG-PET/CT and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy of suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes revealed no malignancy. Sonography of abdomen and pelvis together with detailed urological examination with cystourethroscopy also yielded no evidence for a cancer relapse.\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Onconeural antigen spreading in paraneoplastic neurological disease due to small cell lung cancer occurs during continued inflammation.

Neuropsychological assessment showed severe memory impairment and executive dysfunction . Cerebral MRI exhibited increased T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensities without contrast-enhancement, and cerebral FDG-PET/CT demonstrated glucose hypermetabolism of the right more than left temporomesial brain region . Interictal EEG showed right- more than left-sided temporal slowing in the theta-delta band together with sharp waves and sharp-slow-waves. CSF analysis revealed normal cells counts (3/μl) with normal protein (481 mg/l) and no disruption of the blood/CSF barrier (albumin ratio 5.8 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ), but intrathecal IgG synthesis (55%) and ≥3 CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (type 3 pattern) together with persistently elevated fractions of activated HLADR <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, and CD138 <sup>+ </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> plasma cells  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1, anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies became detectable in serum and CSF . These findings established paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis in addition to demyelinating and axonal polyradiculoneuropathy and illustrate a spread of the paraneoplastic immune response from the peripheral to the central nervous system. Repeated searches for malignancy using FDG-PET/-CT, chest-CT, abdominal sonography, oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Hence, long-term immunosuppressive treatment was initiated using cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every 4–6 weeks) together with anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (starting with 2 × 500 mg/day).\n\n【10】Clinical and paraclinical follow-up examinations during 22 months of immunosuppressive and anticonvulsive treatment after initial amelioration revealed deteriorating memory and executive functions  together with progressive sensory and also cerebellar ataxia and continued temporal lobe seizures prompting enhanced anticonvulsive treatment with levetiracetam (up to 2 × 1000 mg/day). MRI showed persistent hyperintense T2/FLAIR signals of the right more than left mesial temporal lobe without contrast-enhancement together with progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy . FDG-PET/CT illustrated persistent right temporomesial hypermetabolism . Another FDG-PET/CT scan of the whole body did not provide evidence of cancer.\n\n【11】Remarkably, throughout the disease course antigen spreading of the humoral paraneoplastic immune response could be observed. Anti-Hu, anti-SOX1, and anti-Zic4 IgG antibodies persisted whereas anti-Yo IgG antibodies switched to anti-CV2 IgG antibodies in both serum and CSF . In 01/2016, ~30 months after disease onset and initial detection of onconeural IgG antibodies, SCLC was confirmed from another biopsy of the previously suspicious middle pulmonary lobe, which at that point showed distinct tracer-enrichment upon the fifth FDG-PET/CT scan. Additional staging yielded limited disease, and the patient received combined radio-chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Our case represents a typical PND with associated onconeual antibodies which appears a few years ahead of the related malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Multiple coexisting onconeural antibodies are rare, however such clusters of antibodies occur more frequently than previously assumed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, a dynamic switch between distinct onconeural antibody entities during the course of individual PND has not been reported thus far.\n\n【14】In that regard, two pathophysiological scenarios explaining such antigen spreading seem conceivable: First, (mainly peripheral) antigen spreading may be promoted by a switch of antigen expression pattern of the underlying tumor tissue as a result of a mutagenic process caused by the cancer itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This would explain the appearance of anti-Zic4 and anti-CV2 IgG antibodies (at higher concentrations in serum compared to CSF) adding to anti-Hu and anti-SOX1 IgG antibodies which are all frequently associated with PNDs and typical for SCLC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Second, (mainly central) antigen-spreading may be promoted by a self-propagated paraneoplastic immune response with persistent neuronal destruction, liberation, processing and presentation of intracellular neural antigens. This may be enhanced by persistent epileptic activity of the affected brain tissue and (transient) spread of the intrathecal immune response to other sites of the brain and spinal cord i.e. from the limbic system to the cerebellum in this case.

This research paper examines the case of an 18-month-old Syrian female who had been diagnosed with intussusception. The patient underwent laparotomy, and multiple small bowel polyps were found to act as the lead point. For this reason, small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Although PJS diagnosis was histopathologically confirmed, the patient had no pigmented lesions on the face, the lower lip or the buccal mucosa and neither had any history of hospitalization or family history of the disease. This case was examined and is reported in the present study because PJS is rarely present at this early age when significant medical history is lacking.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomatous polyps and pigmented macules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hamartomatous polyps are most commonly found in the small intestine but may also be seen in the stomach and colon. The average age for the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms is 13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and ~50% of patients will suffer from polyps complications—such as intussusception, obstruction and rectal bleeding—by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Common in more than 90% of affected individuals, mucocutaneous pigmented lesions tend to arise in infancy, occurring around the mouth, nostrils, perianal area, fingers and toes and may be the first signs of PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common symptom is recurrent colicky abdominal pain caused by transient intussusception or obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of PJS is assumed if any of the following criteria is met: (i) two or more PJS polyps; (ii) any number of PJS polyps and a history of PJS in a close relative; (iii) characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation in an individual with a history of PJS in a close relative; or (iv) any number of PJS polyps with characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 3 \\]</u>. The majority of individuals with PJS have been found to have genetic alterations in LKB1, and up to 25% of those diagnosed have _de novo_ STK11 mutations with no family history of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PJS is associated with a progressively increasing lifetime risk of developing malignancies—by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-month-old Syrian female baby was admitted to our hospital with complaints of acute abdominal pain, several episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting and red diarrhea. She had neither prior hospitalization nor any significant symptoms in her own medical history, and her family’s history for PJS was negative. On admission, her vital signs were normal, and physical examination did not reveal any peculiar pigmented lesions. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness, diminished bowel sounds and a possible palpable epigastric mass. Blood analysis indicated low hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g ̸dl (n:12 to16 g ̸dl), a mean cell volume of 63.2 F ̸L (N:72–100 F ̸L), but other initial laboratory results were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography, in turn, revealed typical ‘target and pseudo-kidney’ signs. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with small bowel intussusception . Consequently, laparotomy was performed, and surgical examination detected jejunal palpable masses in the intussusceptum. Enterotomy revealed multiple polyps on the mucosal surface , and small bowel resection (~15 cm), with end-to-end anastomosis, were performed. Post-operative course was uneventful. Histopathologic study was conducted on the resected portion, which consisted of a 15-cm specimen from the small bowel containing more than 100 pedunculated polyps on mucosal surface ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm in diameter .\n\n【6】**Figure 1**\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Small bowel intussusception.\n\n【9】**Figure 2**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】Enterotomy.\n\n【12】**Figure 3**\n\n【13】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【14】Multiple polyps on the mucosal surface.\n\n【15】Microscopic examination of polyps showed proliferation of papillary and glandular formations lined by hyperplastic epithelial cells. Stroma was rich in smooth muscle fiber arising from the muscularis mucosae and infiltrated with patchy mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate . Neither adenomatous change nor malignancy was observed after a thorough examination. On the basis of two or more PJS polyps, the diagnosis of PJS syndrome was confirmed.\n\n【16】**Figure 4**\n\n【17】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【18】( **a** ) Microscopic image; ( **b** ) microscopic image; ( **c** ) microscopic image.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【20】PJS is an autosomal dominant condition, which was first described by Peutz in 1921, and it was not until 1949 that Jeghers defined the relation between pigmented lesions and gastrointestinal polyposis, on the one hand, and an increased risk of carcinoma, on the other 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient underwent laparotomy following clinical symptoms of intussusception—confirmed by ultrasonography, and PJS was diagnosed with the help of histopathologic evaluation of the excised bowel. Here we ought to mention that laparoscopy is increasingly the preferred approach for diagnosis and management of acute abdominal and can be performed safely for bowel resection and anastomosis. However, the procedure was not available in the hospital where the study was conducted. Gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps are characteristic of PJS, and they are most commonly found in the small intestine but can also be found in other intestinal or extraintestinal sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The median time to first presentation with polyps is about 11–13 years of age, and ~50% will have experienced intussusception, obstruction or rectal bleeding by the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Although the association between PJS and intussusception is not uncommon, this complication is rarely presented as a first clue of PJS. What is peculiar about our patient is that she presented with intussusception at the age of 18 months as the first complication of PJS.\n\n【21】Mucocutaneous pigmentation is typically found in over 90% of PJS cases but fades with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.The phenotype varies considerably from diffuse, dark freckling over the face to light pigmentation in characteristic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Physical examination of our patient, however, did not reveal any pigmented lesions. PJS is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene (also called LKB1) located at 19p13.3, as it encodes a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a tumor suppressor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Mutations in this gene are detected in 50—90% of individuals with PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although PJS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, up to 25% of cases do not have any family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Similarly, our patient did not have history of PJS in a close relative, and thus her case should be categorized as sporadic PJS, especially given that the authors of this study lacked the means to conduct genetic testing of the case under examination.\n\n【22】PJS is associated with a significantly increased risk of both intestinal and extraintestinal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. It rises with age, by about 1% to 2% by the age of 20, more than 30% by 50 and more than 80% by 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinical guidelines for the surveillance and management of PJS-affected individuals have been established; upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy should be performed every 2–3 years, starting from late teens. Additionally, small bowel visualization should start at the age of 8–10 and should be repeated every 2–3 years. Other screening procedures include clinical examination and specific imaging to screen for lesions of the breast, female genital tract, testis and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, management and follow-up methods for PJS patients continue to be somewhat controversial.\n\n【23】In conclusion, intussusception may be the first lead for PJS regardless of age, family history or pigmentation.\n\n【24】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n--------------------\n\n【25】None declared.\n\n【26】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【27】The authors did not receive any funding to conduct this study.\n\n【28】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【29】No ethical approval was needed.\n\n【30】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【31】Consent has been duly obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We present a middle-aged man who lost consciousness during an air flight for 30 minutes, without any respiratory symptoms.

A giant lung bulla is an uncommon cause of loss of consciousness and may be suspected if it occurs during air travel.\n\n【2】Lung bulla , Air flight , Computed tomography\n\n【3】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【4】A bulla is an air-filled space greater than 1 cm in diameter, while a giant bulla occupies at least a third of the hemithorax. They are caused by smoking and deficiency of α-1 antitrypsin but may occur due to illicit drug use and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Apart from the mentioned risk factors above, they may be more frequent in those greater than 45 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We describe a 42-year-old healthy male who developed sudden loss of consciousness during an air flight, with an incidental finding of a giant lung bulla.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【6】A 42-year-old army man presented with a sudden loss of consciousness for 30 minutes during an air flight that had ascended to 4000 meters above sea level. The loss of consciousness was associated with left arm and left truncal twitching with no eye-rolling, tongue-biting, or bowel and bladder incontinence. Before the loss of consciousness, he experienced frontal headache and dizziness. He did not report any chest pain or difficulty in breathing. He denied a history of smoking, illicit drug use, or trauma. He had traveled by air several times before, most recently being 2 months before the current complaint; however, he never experienced any complications.\n\n【7】On admission, he was fully conscious with stable vitals. His neurology examination revealed facial asymmetry with reduced power of the left upper limb though the tone and reflexes were intact. There were reduced breath sounds on the upper and middle zones of the left lung. His laboratory blood workup was not significant and the serology for HIV and α-1 antitrypsin were negative. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal. His chest x-ray revealed a giant left lung bulla . Chest CT revealed a single giant bulla in the left upper lobe, occupying nearly a third of the left hemithorax suggesting a giant apical bullous emphysema .\n\n【8】**Figure 1**\n\n【9】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【10】Supine chest x-ray shows a large thin-walled cavity in the left upper lobe occupying more than one-third of the affected hemithorax.\n\n【11】**Figure 2**\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Axial (A), Coronal (B), and Sagittal (C) chest CT lung window shows a thin-walled cavitary lesion with thin septations in the apex of the left upper lobe measuring 11.1 cm (AP) x 9.5 cm (T) x 10.9 cm (CC) in size.\n\n【14】A day after his admission, the neurological symptoms had started to regress and his left upper limb weakness had subsided. Since the patient was not having any respiratory complaint or compromise, the patient was observed for a few days without any change in his respiratory system. The patient was saturating well on room air. An option for bullectomy was brought up but the patient refused as he saw himself as fit. He was counseled on the complications of the disease and was discharged. He has been lost to follow-up.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【16】Patients with giant lung bulla typically present with sudden onset difficulty in breathing or chest pain with suspicion of tension pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but rarely loss of consciousness. Our case describes a healthy middle-aged non-smoker without prior history of lung disease presenting with loss of consciousness during an air flight. In chronic pulmonary disease, a patient may have poor lung ventilation or pulmonary hypertension which may contribute to a decline of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) with hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In healthy people, vasoconstriction redistributes pulmonary blood flow to the lung apex, which may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which could help to maintain the PaO <sub>2 </sub> during air travel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Since the left lung apex was compromised in our case, this might have led to a hypoxic event hence loss of consciousness. However, there have been reports of ruptured giant lung bulla during air travel. In such circumstances, the air enters the blood circulation causing cerebral air embolism and neurological deficit such as loss of consciousness and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient had a facial asymmetry with left arm weakness which may have been attributed to a cerebral air embolism although the brain CT was normal. The left-arm weakness may be neuropathic through a direct pressure effect upon the brachial plexus from the expanding bulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】As altitude increases, both atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen and barometric pressure decrease. At 10668 meters (35 000 feet), the actual atmospheric pressure is 179 mmHg, whereas pressurization of the cabin on commercial airliners maintains cabin atmospheric pressures around 564 mmHg (2438 meters/8000 feet). There is an approximate 38% increase in the volume of air in a non-communicating body cavity upon ascent from sea level to the maintained cabin atmospheric pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As Boyle’s law states the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is exposed, therefore, as barometric pressure falls in the aircraft cabin during the ascent, the bulla will expand. The expanded bulla will stretch its wall and compress the surrounding lung causing rupture of the bulla, pneumothorax, and air embolism causing respiratory or neurological complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Lung bullae are best detected on CT imaging as it gives more description on the number, size, and position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in previous literature though it is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Eventually, bullectomy is recommended in symptomatic patients with giant lung bulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, giant lung bulla is a rare cause of loss of consciousness. Though an air embolus was not detected on brain CT imaging, it was likely a hypoxic event that led to the loss of consciousness in our case. This may be suspected when patients lose consciousness during air travel.\n\n【20】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【21】We thank the patient for his patience and cooperation.\n\n【22】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【23】None declared.\n\n【24】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【27】The need for ethical approval was waived.\n\n【28】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【29】We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.\n\n【30】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【31】A.S. is the nominated guarantor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In managing patients with ocular metastasis, quality of life (specifically vision preservation) is one of the most important factors patients and providers consider when deciding on a treatment regimen. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have shown promising results as second-line therapy for patient with metastatic malignancy.

Choroidal metastasis may be a presenting sign of primary or recurrent malignancy, portends very poor survival rates, and is frequently associated with significant visual impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ocular metastases are present in up to 4% of patients with primary gastrointestinal malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, most commonly arising from the lower GI tract and rarely from the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4–6 \\]</u>. Esophageal adenocarcinoma has a particularly poor prognosis with an approximate 5-year survival rate of 22% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, despite treatments including surgical resection, radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. Quality of life in these patients is severely compromised during aggressive therapy.

We present a novel case of a patient with known esophageal adenocarcinoma who was found to have a new onset choroidal metastasis. The patient was treated with pembrolizumab with rapid visual improvement to 20/20 and complete resolution of the uveal mass.\n\n【6】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【7】An 83-year-old Caucasian man with a history of a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema (receiving as-needed intravitreal bevacizumab injections in the right eye and advanced open-angle glaucoma with poor vision in the left eye) presented with new vision complaints. Six months earlier at his previous visit, his visual acuity was 20/20 with resolved branch vein occlusion. He described gradual painless loss of a half-moon of central vision in the right eye over a three-month period. Past medical history was pertinent for known recurrent HER2 receptor positive esophageal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and right pleural base as well as poor cardiac and functional status of 24-month duration. He was previously treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions 11 months earlier and completed local radiation to the primary esophageal mass 13 months earlier.\n\n【8】Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/150 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye (normal range 10–25 mm hg). Anterior segment slit lamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Posterior segment examination of the right eye was notable for a 10.5-sq-mm choroidal lesion centered along the inferior temporal arcade extending into the inferior macula with serous retinal detachment of the macula  with no additional lesions noted in either eye. In view of patient’s medical history, the mass was presumed to be choroidal metastasis secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Local and systemic treatment options including proton beam irradiation and immunotherapy were discussed with the assistance of the oncology team. Ultimately, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was selected to treat the lesion to preserve vision and maintain superior quality of life.\n\n【9】**Figure 1**\n\n【10】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【11】(A) Fundus photo of the right eye demonstrating a large inferior subretinal lesion.

BCVA had improved to 20/40–1 in the right eye with marked decrease in size of the choroidal lesion and serous retinal detachment . At 15 weeks following initiation of pembrolizumab infusions the patient’s visual acuity improved to 20/20 .

Esophageal adenocarcinoma metastasis represents less than 1% of all choroidal metastatic lesions. Choroidal metastasis can present as a challenging treatment dilemma depending on characteristics of the mass, extent of systemic disease, treatment goals of the patient and availability of treatment modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Date et al. reported an excellent outcome in a patient with recurrent metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil and trastuzumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Other reports of choroidal metastasis of esophageal adenocarcinoma have been treated with external beam irradiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy and enucleation with variable improvement of visual symptoms but inevitable death from the systemic complications of the primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Quality of life is often compromised from these aggressive therapies. Reports of the use of pembrolizumab in patients with secondary choroidal metastasis have been described only in cases with primary cutaneous melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, with no reports of its use in the setting of choroidal metastases associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【22】PD1 expression and ligation to PDL1 in neoplastic cells results in a transduction of signals that allows for evasion of neoplastic cells from T-cell mediated immune response. By blocking this interaction, PD1 inhibitor immunotherapy such as pembrolizumab has become integral in the approach to treating cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors continues to be under investigation, though it has been shown to have less adverse events than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced esophageal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Adverse events from anti-PD-1 therapy are thought to occur via excessive activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, which result in excessive inflammation in normal tissues. In a large meta-analysis of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced gastro-esophageal cancer, no major ocular-specific complaints were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, cases have described inflammatory ocular sequelae of pembrolizumab including serous retinal detachment, choroidal effusion and detachment, and posterior uveitis, including birdshot-like chorioretinopathy and retinal vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one particular case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma without ocular metastasis, after three months of pembrolizumab infusions the patient developed isolated biopsy-confirmed vitreous metastasis that was thought to be caused by pembrolizumab-mediated retinal vascular leakage.\n\n【23】In conclusion, pembrolizumab successfully and rapidly decreased the size of choroidal metastasis, restored vision without any adverse events and improved quality of life.

He was diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (pT3N0M0 stage IIB) . The surgically resected lung tumor tissue was negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the lung tumor tissue, using 22C3 programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody, revealed a high expression level of PD-L1. The tumor proportion score (TPS) was 75% . Two months after surgery, computed tomography (CT) showed a right pulmonary hilar tumor with chest wall infiltration, suggesting recurrence of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma . Therefore, the patient was treated with pembrolizumab. The response to pembrolizumab 200mg/body for 3 weeks was defined as a partial response (PR) after the completion of two cycles of pembrolizumab treatment . We continued the pembrolizumab treatment.\n\n【6】Figure 1:\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】( **a** ) Chest CT scans show the primary tumor before operation.

The response to pembrolizumab was defined as a partial response\n\n【12】Twenty-two days after the third cycle of pembrolizumab, the patient was hospitalized because of febrile neutropenia. The neutrophil count before initiation of pembrolizumab administration was 5432/μL. The absolute neutrophil count was 68/μL, however, hemoglobin and platelet levels were within normal limits in peripheral blood. He was treated with meropenem 1g three times daily for 9 days, vancomycin 1g twice daily for 6 days and micafungin 150 mg once daily for 5 days. He underwent a bone marrow puncture. The pathological findings revealed a decrease of mature neutrophils without abnormal levels of other types of blood cells and dysplasia of the bone marrow . Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections were not observed. His titer of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was 1:40 by a fluorescent antibody method before pembrolizumab administration. He did not receive any medicine other than pembrolizumab. Anti-neutrophil antibody was detected in peripheral blood after the treatment with pembrolizumab. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with agranulocytosis associated with pembrolizumab treatment. On the fifth hospital day, we began to administer filgrastim 75 μg/body for 4 days.\n\n【13】Figure 3:\n\n【14】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【15】Hematoxylin–eosin staining of bone marrow aspiration clot revealed a decrease of mature neutrophils but normal levels of other types of blood cells (scale bars 50 μm)\n\n【16】Chest CT scans on admission showed a consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung .

The patient underwent bronchoscopy because of suspected drug-induced pneumonia, but the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture was negative. A pathological examination of transbronchial lung biopsy tissue from the right middle lobe revealed organizing pneumonia showing intraluminal polypoid fibrosis in alveoli . The consolidation in the right lower lung field, seen on chest X-ray, did not improve in spite of empiric systemic antibacterial therapy. We diagnosed ILD induced by pembrolizumab. He had no symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or chest pain.

He did not have ocular symptoms before the initiation of pembrolizumab. No other muscle symptoms were found. The other neurological examination was unremarkable. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs) were positive. He was diagnosed with ocular MG associated with pembrolizumab treatment and was treated with pyridostigmine 60mg three times a day.\n\n【25】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【26】In this report, we have presented a patient with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma who had agranulocytosis, ILD and ocular MG induced by pembrolizumab. No other case of pembrolizumab-caused agranuloytosis could be found in a review of the literature.\n\n【27】ICI often produce good responses and have lead to durable responses in patients with various types of cancer, including NSCLC. Pembrolizumab prolonged progression free survival and overall survival over that obtained by chemotherapy in untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The prognosis for pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma is unfavorable, and a standard therapy has not been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recent studies reported that 70.5–90.2% of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinomas showed high expression levels of PD-L1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors can be expected to be effective in patients with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. In this case, the PD-L1 TPS was 75%, and tumors shrunk clearly after the initiation of pembrolizumab treatment.\n\n【28】IrAEs tend to occur 12–16 weeks after the start of immunotherapy and have been reported in a variety of organs. A recent study suggested that a better response to PD-1 inhibitor therapy was associated with early irAEs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this case, agranulocytosis, ILD and MG developed after 2–3 months, however, the response to pembrolizumab was diagnosed as PR after three cycles of pembrolizumab.\n\n【29】Agranulocytosis is a rare clinical finding, and the incidence of agranulocytosis was reported to be in several cases per million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Drug-induced agranulocytosis tends to appear within 1 year, and the mortality was reported to be 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. G-CSF was reported to be effective for agranulocytosis when administered together with antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To date, several cases of agranulocytosis caused by ICI have been reported. Nivolumab-induced agranulocytosis was reported after one to nine cycles of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Ipilimumab-induced agranulocytosis was reported after four cycles of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Although the standard treatment of agranulocytosis caused by immunotherapy has not been established, previous reports have shown that G-CSF, intravenous immunoglobulin and high doses of steroid were effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 9 \\]</u>. In this case, viral infections and connective tissue diseases were ruled out by a blood test and physical examination. The patient did not take any other drug than pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab was considered to be the cause of agranulocytosis according to the findings in the bone marrow aspiration. The neutrophil count increased and remained within normal limits after G-CSF administration. A recent study demonstrated that drug-induced agranulocytosis was induced not only by direct drug toxicity to bone marrow precursors but also by an immune-mediated mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the mechanism of pembrolizumab-induced agranulocytosis has not been clarified yet.\n\n【30】Several irAEs can be present simultaneously in different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Thus, this patient was affected by agranulocytosis, ILD and ocular MG. The incidence of any-grade ILD by pembrolizumab was reported to be 5.8%, and ILD of grade 3 or 4 was reported to be 2.6% in a recent clinical trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A recent study showed that MG, including generalized MG and ocular MG induced by an ICI, was relatively rare, however, MG-specific-related mortality was 30.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The onset of symptoms of MG was reported to occur 2–12 weeks after the initiation of immunotherapy. It is important to detect symptoms and make a diagnosis of MG as soon as possible. However, the incidence and onset of symptoms of ocular MG alone is unknown. As in this case, patients can be affected by many irAEs. If a patient develops one irAE, one should pay attention to the expression of other irAEs.\n\n【31】In conclusion, we treated pulmonary pleomorphic carcinomas with pembrolizumab with good response. We describe here the first reported case of a patient with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma who developed agranulocytosis with anti-neutrophil antibody after pembrolizumab treatment; the patient was found to have ILD and ocular MG. One should watch out for early irAEs if immunotherapy produced a good response. In this patient, agranulocytosis was immediately improved by administration of G-CSF without use of systemic steroids. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of ICI-induced agranulocytosis.\n\n【32】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【33】We are grateful to healthcare professionals who managed this patient.\n\n【34】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【35】Kaoru Kubota, Masahiro Seike and Akihiko Gemma report honoraria from MSD and Taiho Pharmaceutical, outside the submitted work.\n\n【36】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【37】No funding was received to publish this case report.\n\n【38】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【39】Not required.\n\n【40】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【41】Written informed consent was obtained from this patient’s family for publication of the study including the patient’s details and accompanying images.\n\n【42】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【43】Masahiro Seike.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

His CD4 count has always been low (<100 cells/cumm) in spite of being virally suppressed. He was started on anti-retroviral therapy at 5 and half years of age and he was continued on the same. He was treated conservatively and he continues to have residual right hemiparesis.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Moyamoya disease has been seen in patients with long-standing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) now that survival has improved with good adherence to medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A few cases have been reported in children, in both controlled and uncontrolled HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1–4 \\]</u>. We present the case of an 18-year-old adolescent with congenitally acquired HIV with moyamoya disease who first presented with a stroke at the age of 12 years.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】An 18-year-old boy with congenitally transmitted HIV-1 was diagnosed and started on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) at the age of 5 and half years with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. One month later, he was diagnosed to have abdominal tuberculosis and was given 6 months of anti-tuberculosis therapy. He also has a past history of varicella at the age of 2 and half years. His ART regime was later substituted to abacavir, lamivudine and nevirapine due to the phasing out of stavudine at the age of 9 years, and it was later changed to tenofovir, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir at 12 years due to suspected immunological failure. Lopinavir/ritonavir was later substituted to dolutegravir. He has been virally suppressed all throughout. However, his CD4 count has always been <100 cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> in spite of being virally suppressed. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis has been given all throughout. No other opportunistic infections were seen.\n\n【6】At 12 years of age, he developed right hemiparesis with right-sided choreiform movements. Aspirin was started and the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal/fusiform aneurismal dilatation/ectasia predominantly along the left lateral aspect of the basilar artery just adjacent to its bifurcation, with ectasia of the origin of right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) measuring 8 × 8 × 8 mm along with aneurismal dilatation/ectasia involving the terminal left internal cerebral artery and its bifurcation measuring 6 × 6 × 6 mm, extending to involve proximal A1 and M1 segments along with paucity of M2 and M3 cortical segment vessels. Small vessel ischemic changes were also seen. Thrombotic workup was found to be normal. Renal and lower limb dopplers were normal.\n\n【7】Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) done a year later revealed ectasia of the basilar artery at the bifurcation of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) A1 segment saccular aneurysm. Both right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA) showed vasculitic changes of patchy appearance most pronounced on the left side. ART was continued along with daily aspirin and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy.\n\n【8】Repeat MRI done 5 years later revealed aneurysms at the left internal carotid artery (ICA), with bifurcation of size 5 × 5 mm, and at the basilar artery bifurcation of size 8.7 × 7.6 mm.\n\n【9】DSA repeated 6 years later revealed diffuse narrowing of both right and left supra-clinoid internal carotid arteries (ICA), with aneurysmal dilatation at the right ICA top involving the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), proximal M1 with non-visualization of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) beyond proximal M1 with distal reformation via extensive lenticulostriate collaterals giving a puff of smoke appearance suggestive of moyamoya phenomenon as seen as Fig. 1 .\n\n【10】Figure 1\n\n【11】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【12】DSA showing ( **a** ) left supraclinoid ICA and ( **b** ) right supraclinoid ICA narrowing with obliteration of the anterior carotid and middle carotid arteries and extensive lenticulostriate collateral giving a puff of smoke appearance on both sides.\n\n【13】On examination, his weight was 42.45 kg and height was 160 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was 16.58 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ( _Z_ score between −2 and − 3 SD). His heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute and blood pressure was 114/80 mmHg. Old scars of varicella infection were present over the face. Cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a residual paresis on the right side with a power of Grade 5. The aspirin was discontinued and the patient continues to be on regular follow-up.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【15】HIV-associated vasculopathy in patients with HIV-1 disease has been found to be due to the proinflammatory state and cytokine imbalance, leading to endothelial damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Involvement of the regulatory protein Tat in cytokine dysregulation in the central nervous system has been mentioned as a possible cause along with elevated levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Immune activation in response to transendothelial migration of HIV strains coupled with HIV tropism for brain mononuclear cells has been postulated in the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Moyamoya disease should be considered in children with HIV having a stroke. The most common arteries to be affected are the ICA, followed by the MCA and ACA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient also showed involvement of both the ICAs. Medial fibrosis, intimal hypoplasia and loss of muscularis and elastic tissue are the common histopathological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Intimal staining of the involved cerebral arteries have revealed transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-gp 41, suggesting transendothelial migration of the virus and a direct effect of the virus in the pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Varicella infection and tuberculosis have been described as possible aetiologies of acute hemiplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. However, our patient did not show any clinical signs of active infection. Complications of moyamoya disease include cerebral ischemia and haemorrhage, leading to weakness, speech disorder and convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with hemiparesis on the right side with no speech abnormalities or seizures. Treatment in children is largely conservative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, revascularization surgery is being increasingly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Early initiation of ART plays a vital role in the prevention of HIV vasculopathy. Protease inhibitors have been linked to drug-induced vasculopathy. Monitoring of patients to maintain good adherence to ART, thus achieving viral suppression and good immunity, may help prevent vascular complications. Ongoing clinical monitoring to prevent rupture of the cerebral aneurysm and haemorrhage is vital in these patients.\n\n【17】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【18】The authors thank Dr Krishna Chidrawar, Clinical fellow—Interventional Radiology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400022.\n\n【19】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【20】None declared.\n\n【21】FUNDING\n-------\n\n【22】Funding towards the article processing charges received from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n【23】ETHICAL APPROVAL\n----------------\n\n【24】Taken from Hospital Ethics Committee.\n\n【25】CONSENT\n-------\n\n【26】Patient’s written consent was obtained for publication.\n\n【27】GUARANTOR\n---------\n\n【28】Dr Noella Pereira, Consultant—Paediatric HIV & Telemedicine, Paediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022.\n\n【29】DETAILS OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH AUTHOR\n------------------------------------------\n\n【30】All authors were involved in patient management, preparation of manuscript and approval of the final version.\n\n【31】NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT AND INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE WORK SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Centre of Excellence for HIV Care, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College & General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022, India.\n\n【33】DISCLAIMERS, IF ANY\n-------------------\n\n【34】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "oxford", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We describe the case of a 28-year old man who presented with a nasal septum perforation. He admitted the use of cocaine and showed no other symptoms of systemic inflammation. Perinuclear anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies (p-ANCAs) came back positive, as did anti-proteinase 3-antibodies. Further testing revealed antibodies to human neutrophil elastase (HNE), typically found in CIMD but rarely in ANCA-associated vasculitis. The combination of an atypical ANCA-pattern and the detection of HNE-antibodies led to the diagnosis of CIMD.

He already received a 3-week course of antibiotics (Amoxicillin–clavulanate) without improvement. Laboratory analysis demonstrated inflammation with a C-reactive protein of 77 mg/L and mild leukocytosis (11.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with eosinophilia. Rhinoscopy showed a large nasal septum perforation. Nasal endoscopy revealed extensive necrosis and scabs. A computed tomography sinuses confirmed the presence of a nasal septum perforation . When asked about it, the patient admitted the use of cocaine, and also the urinary toxicology test was strongly positive for this drug. The diagnosis of a cocaine-induced midline destruction (CIMD) was made.\n\n【5】**Figure 1**\n\n【6】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【7】Sagittal and transverse computed tomography section through the nasal septum showing a nasal septum perforation.\n\n【8】As a nasal septum perforation can also be the presenting symptom of an ANCA-associated vasculitis, such as (limited) granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies (ANCAs) were measured. Perinuclear ANCAs (p-ANCAs) came back positive (titer 1/80), as did anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies (9.7 U/mL, considered positive if >3 U/mL). Myeloperoxidase antibodies were negative. Further testing revealed antibodies to human neutrophil elastase (HNE).\n\n【9】Literature data show that patients with CIMD often have positive ANCAs, which makes it difficult to differentiate between CIMD and ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, positive ANCAs in CIMD are often seen in atypical patterns, for example p-ANCAs in combination with anti-PR3-antibodies (whereas with GPA, one would expect c-ANCAs directed against PR3). Furthermore, ANCAs in CIMD are often targeted against atypical antigens such as HNE whereas HNE-antibodies are rarely found in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2–4 \\]</u>.

Patients with TSC are usually diagnosed early in life. However, in some cases, the diagnosis is delayed until adulthood because various manifestations occur at various times throughout an individual’s life. In this regard, we present the case of a female patient diagnosed at the beginning of the seventh decade of life. The patient had a history of seizures and showed clinical findings on the skin (facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, ‘Confetti-like’ skin lesions, shagreen patch), brain (cortical tubers), heart (cardiac rhabdomyomas), kidneys (angiomyolipomas) and a positive genetic test for mutations in TSC2, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria. We compared the differences between manifestations in patients diagnosed during childhood and adulthood. Knowledge of the clinical spectrum of TSC allows early identification.\n\n【2】INTRODUCTION\n------------\n\n【3】Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), also called Pringle Bourneville disease, is a rare autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by hamartomatous growth in multiple organ systems, such as the brain, retina, kidney, skin, heart and lung, because of hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway as a result of a mutation in the tumor-suppressor gene TS1 (encoding hamartin) or, more commonly, TSC2 (encoding tuberin) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The name of the disorder is derived from the Latin word tuber (root-shaped growths) and the Greek word skleros (hard), which refers to thick, firm and pale gyri called ‘tubers’ that Desire-Magloire Bourneville first described in 1880 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its estimated population incidence rate is from 1:6760 to 1:13 520 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The TSC diagnostic criteria include genetic testing to improve the identification of cases, although clinical features continue to be the principal means of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is established in early life in more than 80% of cases, often secondary to the presence of seizures or hypomelanotic macules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, there remains a subset of patients in whom the diagnosis is delayed until adulthood, usually performed because of dermatological, renal or pulmonary alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Here, we present the case of a patient diagnosed with TSC in the seventh decade of life.\n\n【4】CASE REPORT\n-----------\n\n【5】A 60-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department because of blisters on the right arm that began 72 h before admission after exposure to grass. In her family history, she reported a daughter with a genetic diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis; other family members were not reported. Her medical history included a diagnosis of seizures during childhood, receiving unspecified treatment for a short time with spontaneous remission, and a 2-year history of arterial hypertension treated with losartan 50 mg/day. Physical examination revealed the presence of blisters on an erythematous base on the anterior right forearm. In addition, other skin lesions characterized by multiple shiny dome-shaped papules on the nose and cheeks , multiple fibromas growing in the periungual area of the left foot , slightly hypopigmented plaques on the lumbar region suggestive of shagreen patch  and multiple hypomelanotic macules on the anterior chest compatible with guttate leukoderma 通用删除1(英):<u>(‘Confetti-like’ skin lesions, Fig. 1d )</u> were observed; she referred that these lesions appeared since childhood. The rest of the exploration was normal, including intellectual status and ophthalmologic review.\n\n【6】Figure 1\n\n【7】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【8】Cutaneous manifestations of TSC: ( **a** ) facial angiofibromas: multiple shiny dome-shaped papules on the nose and cheeks.

( **c** ) Shagreen patch: slightly hypopigmented plaques on the lumbar region. ( **d** ) Leukoderma guttata ‘confetti’ macules: multiple hypomelanotic macules on the anterior chest.\n\n【9】A diagnosis of contact dermatitis was established for the lesions on the right arm. However, the patient was hospitalized for further study because of other skin findings. Initial laboratory tests (complete blood count, and renal and hepatic function tests) did not reveal any alterations. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of cortical tubers . Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed more than two angiomyolipomas (AMLs) in the kidneys, with no lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) at the pulmonary level . Transthoracic echocardiography showed a cardiac rhabdomyoma in the interventricular septum . A genetic test was performed for suspected tuberous sclerosis, which reported a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene TSC2. Tuberculous sclerosis was diagnosed according to the 2021 International TSC Consensus Group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> .

Definite TSC: two major features or one major feature with two minor features. Possible TSC: either one major feature or ≥2 minor features. Genetic diagnosis: a pathogenic variant of TSC1 or TSC2 is diagnostic of TSC. <sup>* </sup> The patient met the criteria marked with a ✓.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】The diagnosis of TSC may be difficult because its symptoms are not pathognomonic. The ‘classic triad’ of symptoms in TSC (seizures, mental retardation and angiofibromas) occurs in only 29% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Many features can be considered as isolated findings or because of other conditions. The differential diagnosis of hypopigmented macules includes vitiligo, nevus depigmentus and piebaldism. Single facial angiofibromas or renal AMLs may be seen as isolated findings, whereas ungual fibromas may result from trauma. Therefore, the presence of multiple findings may help distinguish isolated conditions from TSC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In addition, the clinical presentation of TSC differs between patients diagnosed in childhood or adulthood. Skin lesions are among adults’ most common manifestations of TSC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In a case series of 30 adult women with delayed diagnosis of TSC (performed at age ≥ 18 years), angiofibromas and ungual fibromas were the most frequently observed cutaneous findings in 100 and 83% of the cases, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In contrast, hypomelanotic macules are often the first and most frequently reported cutaneous finding in children and are detected less frequently in older patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. In this regard, our patient showed cutaneous tubers and hypopigmented skin lesions.\n\n【18】Neurological involvement is present in almost all individuals with TSC and is one of the leading causes of morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Nearly 100% of patients develop epilepsy, which usually begins within the first year of life; however, in some cases, it is not present until adolescence or early adulthood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This can be explained by the high prevalence of intracranial abnormalities, such as cortical tubers and/or subependymal nodules, which can be seen in 95–100% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, adults with TSC are less likely to have seizures or present seizures later in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, many adult patients diagnosed with TSC do not have profound intellectual deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In the present case, the patient reported seizures in childhood but not during her adult life, despite the presence of cortical tubers, and did not present with intellectual deficits.\n\n【19】Cardiac rhabdomyomas are found in 40–60% of patients with TSC, usually in patients < 2 years of age, and their presence in adults is infrequent. In addition, almost all patients are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this regard, we identified a cardiac rhabdomyoma in the interventricular septum of the patient. This could be explained by the _de novo_ appearance or growth of the previous mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】AMLs are the most common renal manifestation. In adult patients with TSC, more than 67% had AMLs, in contrast to what was observed in children (17%). It is believed that AMLs grow during childhood and early adulthood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Searching for renal involvement even without symptoms is essential, because renal disease is the leading cause of death in patients with TSC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Therefore, we performed abdominal CT searching for renal lesions even though the patient did not show symptoms or abnormalities in renal function.\n\n【21】In patients with TSC diagnosed in adulthood, identification of the illness is usually delayed for prolonged periods. In a study that included 30 patients diagnosed at ≥21 years of age, 77% had symptoms or signs years before diagnosis, such as seizures, skin lesions and renal AMLs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this respect, we classified our patient with a late diagnosis because she showed early neurological and cutaneous manifestations. Earlier missed manifestations may be because some features remain entirely absent, whereas others appear, grow and regress over time. The manifestations of TSC may be incorrectly classified, leading to a diagnosis of other diseases. Seibert _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> proposed that TSC should be considered in adults with any one of the following: bilateral or multiple renal AMLs, LAM- or TSC-associated skin lesions, even in the absence of seizures, intellectual disability or an affected family member.\n\n【22】In conclusion, the clinical spectrum of TSC varies with age. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the myriad potential of presenting symptoms and signs of TSC. Furthermore, when a child is identified as having TSC, their parents should be screened to rule out the disease. Early diagnosis is essential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.\n\n【23】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【24】We appreciate the willingness of our patient and her relatives to provide for this work as well as the different departments for their enriching contributions.\n\n【25】CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n------------------------------\n\n【26】None declared.\n\n【27】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【28】All authors listed in this manuscript made substantial contributions to data acquisition, analysis or interpretation and were involved in critically drafting or revising this article for important intellectual content.

Pulmonary edema on CXR, ST-depression on ECG, posterolateral wall hypokinesis on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and elevated serum troponin level were consistent with NSTEMI. She was urgently taken to the Cath lab. Left heart catheterization (LHC) with 100% obtuse-marginal (OM) artery occlusion led to a single drug-eluting stent placement in the lateral branch of OM .\n\n【11】Figure 1\n\n【12】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【13】Initial cardiac catheterization before stent placement.\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【16】Initial cardiac catheterization during and after stent placement.\n\n【17】Thirteen months after stent placement, with intermittent burning left chest discomfort, patient sought a second opinion from another cardiologist. On review of initial LHC, concerns were raised about the proximal extension of the dissection into the left main coronary artery (LMCA). This prompted a recommendation for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which revealed evidence of SCAD in LMCA extending into the distal LMCA and proximal OM branch with aneurysm formation at distal LMCA and Left circumflex artery (LCX) . Repeat LHC revealed aneurysms in distal LMCA and mid-left circumflex artery, with 50% narrowing of the lumen in between two aneurysms, as well as a focal dissection in the medial branch of LCX . The previously placed stent was patent. With LMCA involvement, decision was made to proceed with a three-vessel CABG. At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, the patient is doing well and remains pain-free. Neck and abdomen MR-angiography reported normal carotid, cervical and renal arteries. The genetic panel for aneurysm-related disorders was negative.\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【20】Evidence of SCAD in LMCA extending to the distal LMCA in CCTA.\n\n【21】Figure 4\n\n【22】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【23】( **a** ) Distal LMCA prior to the visualization of the dissection flap has a lumen area of 0.46 sq cm.

The more lateral branch has a stent with mild to moderate intimal hyperplasia (yellow arrow). The more medial branch has a focal area of dissection (green arrow). The terminal LCX is free of the disease.\n\n【27】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【28】The complexity of PAMI, in contrast to non-PAMI, poses management challenges owing to the high prevalence of pregnancy-related SCAD (P-SCAD). Catheter-based coronary angiography is the gold standard diagnostic test for diagnosis of SCAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Noninvasive CCTA has a potential role in diagnosing SCAD in patients with acute chest pain and low risk for coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5–8 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Conservative therapy is the preferred management for hemodynamically stable patients with SCAD in the absence of MI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the presence of MI, PCI with stent placement is considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In patients with LMCA, proximal, multivessel dissections, complex lesions, failure of attempted PCI and refractory ischemia, CABG is the desirable mode of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11–13 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Refractory ischemia, despite conservative or invasive therapy, warrants investigation for dissection propagation, intramural hematoma displacement, and aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Both diagnostic and therapeutic invasive procedures increase the risk of dissection extension and new iatrogenic dissection formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】CCTA is a noninvasive, quick and accessible modality with high diagnostic accuracy for detecting obstructive CAD (95% sensitivity and 83% specificity) and has a 99% negative predictive value 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. CCTA is capable of visualizing the healing process and life-threatening aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. CCTA has limitations in detecting mid to distal coronary artery dissection. Normal CCTA in a symptomatic patientcannot rule out SCAD.\n\n【32】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【33】In this case presentation, we aim to highlight the potential role of CCTA in the diagnosis and follow-up of P-SCAD, given the high accuracy and noninvasiveness of this diagnostic modality in the context of the high prevalence of SCAD in symptomatic or asymptomatic PAMI.\n\n【34】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n----------------\n\n【35】We would like to mention our gratitude to Dr Craig Reiss, Chief of Cardiology Services at St. Luke’s Hospital, Dr Fred J.

An underlying cardiac cause, for example myocardial infarction, had already been ruled out by a cardiologist. Upon admission the patient was stable with no fever present, but her laboratory results showed high inflammatory markers (i.e. C-reactive protein 321 mg/l). Computed tomography (CT) of head, chest and abdomen showed no local shoulder pathology or other clear focus of infection, therefore she was empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. The following day she developed symptoms of shock (heart rate 67/min, RR 66/38 mmHg, mottling of the skin, hypothermia(34.7°C)), for which she was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n【2】Initially we hypothesized this to be a septic shock. Upon admission to the ICU however, her body temperature had spontaneously normalized and follow-up inflammatory markers were found to be decreasing, bringing into question whether the sepsis-hypothesis should be further pursued. Nevertheless, CT-angiography of the chest and abdomen also showed no signs of aortic dissection, hemorrhage or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac re-evaluation was unremarkable. Therefore hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and obstructive shock were also deemed unlikely.\n\n【3】During the first 12h our patient developed progressive motor- and sensory function loss of all extremities. MRI of the spine revealed a spondylodiscitis level C4 through C6 with an epidural abscess compressing the spinal cord, accompanied by a new vertebral compression fracture of C5 _通用删除1(英):<u>(_ Fig. 1 _and_ 2 _)</u>_ .

Because one problem triggers a series of events that lead to further indications and symptoms, PRS is not regarded as a syndrome in and of itself but rather as a series of conditions. In the first trimester, mandibular hypoplasia, which can have an underlying condition or not, reduces the oropharyngeal space and causes the tongue to move upward and posteriorly, impairing the ability of the palate to close and obstructing the hypopharynx 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. We present a case of a PRS-related anatomical anomaly that hindered attempts to manage the airway and the final approach that made it possible to insert an endotracheal tube (ETT). We describe the use of a flexible fiberoptic video-ureteroscope,  as an alternative to a bronchoscope, for airway management. To our knowledge, there is no documentary evidence of the use of a video ureteroscope as an airway endoscope for difficult airway management in a neonate.\n\n【4】Figure 1\n\n【5】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【6】Ureteroscope.\n\n【7】Figure 2\n\n【8】Open in new tab Download slide\n\n【9】Labelled depiction of ureteroscope with different parts.\n\n【10】CASE PRESENTATION\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 7-day-old, 2-kg boy was referred to our tertiary care hospital with diagnosed PRS. He had agnathia, glossoptosis and cleft palate. The patient was a preterm child born by normal delivery at 34 weeks of gestation to a middle-class family of south Asian ethnicity. Upon admission, he developed cyanosis with an arterial saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 90% and a venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 77.8 mmHg. He had a 0.2-cm mouth opening and hence laryngoscopy was not possible. His saturation was improved to 95% by oxygen with a facial mask. The same night he deteriorated to an SpO2 of 80%. Next, we tried blind nasal intubation with an ETT loaded with stylet, which failed. Then, we tried Size 1 laryngeal mask airway (Well Lead Medical, China) which failed as well. His respiratory distress was improved after we placed an NPA and saturation returned to 100%.\n\n【12】He was planned for correction of the mandible with mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) under general anaesthesia. After giving oxymetazoline nasal drops to dry his secretion, we slowed dialled sevoflurane to 6% and then back to 3% to maintain his spontaneous breathing. Fibreoptic scope (Olympus, Japan) revealed the epiglottis lying on the posterior pharynx, which could not be manoeuvred. Due to repeated attempts, the patient developed laryngospasm, and his (SpO2) was reduced to 70%. Anaesthetic depth was increased with sevoflurane and SpO2 improved to 94%. Once laryngospasm settled, a 2.8-mm outer diameter video ureteroscope was introduced through the nasal cavity. Glottis was visualized but the ETT could not be negotiated into the trachea. Following jaw thrust and slight pulling of the tongue with Magill’s Forceps, a 150-cm long and 0.035-inch diameter atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic polyurethane-coated (PC) guidewire was introduced through the working channel of the video ureteroscope into the trachea under the vision  and a 3.5-mm ID ETT was railroaded over it and a definitive airway was established. Once the airway was secured, the patient had an MDO procedure and no adverse events were encountered. He was sent back to neonatal ICU and successfully extubated there on post-operative day 5. Presently, the child is doing fine and only requires minimal oxygen support with nasal prongs.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【14】Infants with PRS may exhibit stridor, chest retraction, sleep apnoea, cyanosis and respiratory insufficiency along with different degrees of upper airway blockage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Furthermore, 25–45% of new-borns with PRS exhibit feeding and swallowing issues, which may be connected to respiratory conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. During laryngoscopy and intubation, the Pierre Robin Syndrome presents significant difficulty for anaesthesiologists, making oxygenation and ventilation challenging. The airway structure of PRS new-borns makes them one of the most challenging cases to intubate. The anaesthesiologist uses a variety of tools, including the Ambuscope, fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) and video laryngoscopes, in difficult airway management situations.\n\n【15】We describe the novel use of a video ureteroscope (Olympus URF-V2) as an airway endoscope. In urology, kidney stones are typically removed with a video ureteroscope. It has a wider field of vision and is longer than a FOB. Currently, sizes with an outside diameter of only 1.8 mm are accessible. In contrast to a FOB, which only offers an angulation of 160° up and 90°, it offers 275° of up- and downangulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. There is little research on video ureteroscopes for airway endoscopy, and there are few sporadic case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. With a distal tip diameter ranging from 5.3 to 8.7 Fr, flexible ureteroscopes are currently offered in a variety of sizes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We used a 2.8-mm (8.4 Fr) video ureteroscope with a working channel of 1.2 mm to pass the atraumatic, Roadrunner® hydrophilic PC guidewire into the trachea. These guidewires used through a working channel of the ureteroscope are coated with a hydrophilic polymer like polytetrafluoroethylene and have a distal atraumatic tip useful for negotiating difficult ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool in the armoury of an anaesthesiologist. At our institute, which is a tertiary care centre, we are now training and utilising video-ureteroscope as an airway endoscope. We have already made use of this vital instrument in several other cases like removal of foreign body, difficult airway management in severe temporomandibular joint ankylosis and also in some cases of one lung ventilation for checking the correct placement of Double lumen tube. Through this case report, we want to highlight the importance of this novel method of airway management which can go a long way in developing new strategies for difficult airway management in the times to come. The legal designate consent has been taken from the father of the child.\n\n【16】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【17】We conclude that a flexible fibreoptic ureteroscope may be useful in the management of a difficult airway and may become an important tool for difficult airway management.\n\n【18】AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS\n----------------------\n\n【19】A.B. was responsible for the conception and design of the work; R.G. did the analysis of review of literature; S.T. drafted the work and compared our analysis with previous literature on the case.
