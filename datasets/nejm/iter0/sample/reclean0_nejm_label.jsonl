We conducted a population-based, randomized, 10-week dietary-supplementation trial in which the effects of 6 g per day of 85 percent eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were compared with those of 6 g per day of corn oil in 156 men and women with previously untreated stable, mild essential hypertension.\n\n【3】The mean systolic blood pressure fell by 4.6 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic pressure by 3.0 mm Hg (P = 0.0002) in the group receiving fish oil; there was no significant change in the group receiving corn oil. The differences between the groups remained significant for both systolic (6.4 mm Hg; P = 0.0025) and diastolic (2.8 mm Hg; P = 0.029) pressure after control for anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables. The decreases in blood pressure were larger as concentrations of plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acids increased (P = 0.027). Dietary supplementation with fish oil did not change mean blood pressure in the subjects who ate fish three or more times a week as part of their usual diet, or in those who had a base-line concentration of plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acids above 175.1 mg per liter.\n\n【4】We conclude that eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids reduce blood pressure in essential hypertension, depending on increases in plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acids. (N Engl J Med 1990; 322:795–801.)\n\n【5】Introduction\n------------\n\n【6】IN 1951 Ehrström <sup><a>1 </a></sup> noted that \"arterial hypertension of the malignant type has never been diagnosed in North Greenland and essential hypertension is rare.\" The results of more recent studies of blood pressure in Eskimo populations are conflicting. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> <sup><a>3 </a></sup> <sup><a>4 </a></sup> <sup><a>5 </a></sup> The apparent low death rate from coronary heart disease among Eskimos <sup><a>6 </a></sup> has focused interest on the potential beneficial effects of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil on blood lipid and lipoprotein levels, <sup><a>7 </a></sup> platelet aggregability, <sup><a>8 </a></sup> and antiinflammatory or immunologic effects. <sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【7】Fish oils have lowered blood pressure in normotensive <sup><a>10 </a></sup> <sup><a>11 </a></sup> <sup><a>12 </a></sup> <sup><a>13 </a></sup> <sup><a>14 </a></sup> and hypertensive <sup><a>15 </a></sup> <sup><a>16 </a></sup> <sup><a>17 </a></sup> <sup><a>18 </a></sup> subjects in some but not all intervention trials. <sup><a>19 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>20 </a></sup> The extent to which these reports can be generalized is constrained by limitations in study design, particularly in cases in which large doses of oil were given and the dietary changes were not documented or controlled. <sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【8】We therefore conducted a population-based, randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of fish oil and corn oil to test the hypothesis that supplementing the usual Western diet with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids would reduce blood pressure in hypertension. We also monitored diet and assessed levels of plasma phospholipid fatty acids to determine the relation between diet, fatty acids, and blood pressure.\n\n【9】Methods\n-------\n\n【10】Subjects\n--------\n\n【11】In 1986—1987, 21,826 subjects — 81.3 percent of the men 20 to 61 years old and the women 20 to 56 years old living in the municipality of Tromsø, Norway — participated in a health survey. All completed a questionnaire about previous cardiovascular disease, diet, and smoking habits, and their weight, height, blood pressure, and nonfasting serum lipid concentrations were measured. All 299 subjects between the ages of 34 and 60 who were not receiving antihypertensive treatment, whose diastolic blood pressure was above 97 mm Hg, and whose systolic blood pressure was below 210 mm Hg were asked to undergo clinical examination that included a complete history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and electrocardiography. Among the 236 subjects who underwent the examination, 201 who had no cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorder, diabetes mellitus, disabling chronic disease, psychopathologic disease, alcoholism, or extreme obesity (body-mass index \\[weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters\\] >32) were recruited into this study. The study was approved by the regional board of research ethics, and each subject gave written informed consent. The study began with a six-month run-in period during which the subjects were asked to continue their usual diet and living habits and during which their blood pressure was measured on three occasions.\n\n【12】Table 1.  Table 1. Composition of the Fish-Oil and Corn-Oil Supplements.\n\n【13】For entry into the intervention phase of the trial, the mean diastolic pressure during the run-in period had to be between 85 and 110 mm Hg, and the mean systolic blood pressure below 180 mm Hg. Among the 201 subjects, 21 had blood-pressure values that did not meet these criteria, 13 dropped out for personal reasons, and 10 were found to have one or more of the disorders listed above. Thus, 157 subjects entered the 10-week intervention trial. They were randomly assigned to receive fish oil or corn oil after stratification according to sex. The fish-oil group was given 6 g of 85 percent eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (ethyl ester K85, Norsk Hydro, Oslo, Norway) per day. This increased their average intake of these acids from 1.0 to 6.1 g per day. The corn-oil group received 6 g of corn oil per day, which increased their dietary intake of linoleic acid from 8.9 to 12.3 g per day. The oils ( Table 1 ) were given in indistinguishable soft gelatin capsules, each containing 1 g of fatty acids. Either supplement provided approximately 2 percent of the mean daily energy intake. The subjects were again asked at the start of the intervention phase not to change their diets or living habits.\n\n【14】After 5 and 10 weeks of supplementation with fish oil or corn oil, the participants were examined between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. after an overnight fast. They were asked not to smoke during the two hours before the examination. Compliance was assessed by counting leftover capsules, and the subjects were questioned about side effects and intercurrent diseases.\n\n【15】Clinical and Laboratory Measurements\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Blood pressure was recorded before blood sampling by a specially trained secretary using an automatic device (Dinamap, Critikon, Tampa). The instrument measured blood pressure by the oscillometric method <sup><a>22 </a></sup> and calculated the mean arterial pressure automatically by dividing the area under the pressure wave form by the time during which the area was measured. <sup><a>22 </a></sup> After the subjects had been seated for two minutes, three recordings were made at two-minute intervals. The mean of the last two measurements was used. Then, two measurements were made after the subjects had been standing for two minutes, and the mean values were calculated. The recorder was calibrated with the same mercury sphygmomanometer at regular intervals. Body weight was measured with an electronic scale, with the subjects wearing light clothing.\n\n【17】Each subject's average intake of nutrients was estimated by a certified clinical nutritionist using 24-hour dietary-recall records. Interviews were conducted five weeks before the start of the intervention trial and at its end. <sup><a>23 </a></sup> Dietary constituents were calculated from standard Norwegian food tables. <sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【18】Blood samples were obtained at the beginning and end of the 10-week intervention period. Plasma and serum were stored at — 80°C until the study was completed, and they were analyzed before the randomization code was broken. Serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was measured after the precipitation of serum with phosphotungstic acid and magnesium chloride. <sup><a>25 </a></sup> Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric methods with commercial kits (CHOD-PAP for cholesterol and GPO-PAP for triglycerides; Boehringer–Mannheim, Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany). Both samples from each patient were analyzed at the same time. Plasma lipids were extracted with n-butanol (butyl alcohol). <sup><a>26 </a></sup> The phospholipids were isolated from these extracts by column chromatography after diheptadecanoyl-glycerophosphocholine and butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma Chemical, Pool, United Kingdom) had been added as an internal standard and antioxidant, respectively. The phospholipids were transmethylated and quantitated by gas—liquid chromatography. <sup><a>27 </a></sup> A normal human serum sample was included as a control to monitor analytical performance. The day-to-day coefficients of variation (n = 55) for 20:4n—6, 20:5n—3, and 22:6n—3 fatty acids were 3.8, 3.7, and 4.7 percent, respectively. The results were quantitated as milligrams of phospholipid fatty acid per liter of plasma.\n\n【19】Bleeding time was measured by the Simplate-II method (General Diagnostics, Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium), platelet counts and plasma fibrinogen levels by standard laboratory methods, and serum alpha-tocopherol levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. <sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】The primary end point was a change in blood pressure between the beginning (base line) and the end of the 10-week intervention trial. The study was designed to detect a difference of 3.5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure at a two-sided level of significance of 0.05, with a power of 0.90. We analyzed the data in three ways. First, the changes in blood pressure in the fish-oil and corn-oil groups were compared. Second, we compared changes in blood pressure within and between strata divided according to the usual consumption of fish, using results obtained during the run-in period, and strata divided according to concentrations of plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acids. In these analyses we used the difference between the beginning blood pressure and the arithmetic mean of the blood pressures measured after 5 and 10 weeks. Mean arterial pressure was used in subgroup analyses. Third, the association between the change in blood pressure and the change in concentrations of plasma phospholipid fatty acids was examined. The data were analyzed for statistical significance by t-tests and by chi-square statistics when appropriate. Analysis of covariance was used for tests of interaction and for adjustments. The association between the change in blood pressure and the change in concentrations of plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acids was tested by computing simple and partial Pearson's correlation coefficients (adjusted for age, sex, change in weight, energy intake, and concentrations of plasma phospholipid saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids) with pooled data from both supplementation groups. Linear trend was assessed by analysis of variance with contrasts (−3,−1,1,3) between means of categories. The SAS software package <sup><a>29 </a></sup> was used. All results are given as means ±SD. P values lower than 0.05 were considered to indicate significance.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Table 2. Table 2. Characteristics of the Subjects with Hypertension in the Fish-Oil and Corn-Oil Groups.\\* Table 3.  Table 3. Intake of Nutrients and Body Weight before and after 10 Weeks of Supplementation with Fish Oil or Corn Oil.\\*\n\n【24】Table 2 shows that the groups assigned to receive fish oil and corn oil were well balanced at base line. All 157 subjects completed the study, but the results from 1 man were excluded from our analysis because he had a myocardial infarction and was then treated with cardiac drugs; our results are therefore based on the data from 156 subjects. The reported side effects were mild or moderate abdominal problems, such as belching, self-limited diarrhea, and obstipation. Their frequencies were similar in the two groups after 5 weeks, but after 10 weeks 19 subjects in the corn-oil group and 9 in the fish-oil group reported such problems. The subjects receiving corn oil and fish oil took 94.2 and 90.4 percent, respectively, of the prescribed number of capsules. There were no dietary changes during the trial in the fish-oil group, whereas in the corn-oil group there was a small reduction in dietary carbohydrate and dietary n—3 fatty acids ( Table 3 ). The mean body weight increased 0.70 kg in the fish-oil group and 0.56 kg in the corn-oil group ( Table 3 ). Serum alpha-tocopherol levels did not change in the fish-oil group, but increased slightly in the corn-oil group. Bleeding time, platelet count, and plasma fibrinogen levels did not change significantly in either group.\n\n【25】There was no change in serum total cholesterol levels in either group. Serum HDL cholesterol values increased from 1.34 to 1.41 mmol per liter (5.2 percent; P = 0.020) among those receiving fish oil and from 1.33 to 1.40 mmol per liter (5.3 percent; P = 0.002) among those receiving corn oil. The change was not significantly different (P = 0.69) between groups. In the fish-oil group, serum triglyceride levels decreased from 1.48 to 1.18 mmol per liter (20.3 percent; P = 0.0007), whereas in the corn-oil group serum triglyceride levels did not change.\n\n【26】Plasma Concentrations of Phospholipid Fatty Acids and Consumption of Fish\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Table 4.  Table 4. Plasma Phospholipid Fatty Acid Concentrations before and after 10 Weeks of Supplementation with Fish Oil or Corn Oil.\\*\n\n【28】The mean plasma concentration of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids increased and that of phospholipid n—6 fatty acids decreased in the group receiving fish oil ( Table 4 ), increasing the ratio of eicosapentaenoic to arachidonic acid from 0.42 to 1.22 (P<0.0001). In the corn-oil group the mean plasma concentration of phospholipid n—6 fatty acids increased, and that of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids decreased. There were no significant changes in plasma levels of phospholipid total or saturated fatty acids in either group. In a subgroup of 22 randomly selected men from both groups, the fatty acid distribution in platelet phospholipids was measured (data not shown). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the changes in the concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid in platelets and in plasma phospholipids was 0.91 (P<0.0001), indicating that the changes in the fatty acid composition of biologic membranes during the study were similar to those in plasma levels of phospholipid fatty acids.\n\n【29】Exactly 50 percent of the subjects reported consuming three or more fish dishes a week on their usual diet. Among them were 44 in the corn-oil group and 34 in the fish-oil group. When compared with these subjects, those who consumed fewer than three fish dishes a week had lower base-line plasma concentrations of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids (169.2±47.5 vs. 199.4±65.3 mg per liter; P = 0.0014) and higher concentrations of n—6 fatty acids (450.7±75.3 vs. 414.0±77.8 mg per liter; P = 0.0038). The plasma concentrations of phospholipid saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were similar. Within the fish-oil group, those with a low intake of fish had a larger mean increase in plasma levels of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids, as compared with those with a high intake of fish (71.9 vs. 58.7 percent), and a larger mean decrease in plasma concentrations of phospholipid linoleic acid (19.7 vs. 17.5 percent) during supplementation.\n\n【30】Base-Line Blood Pressure\n------------------------\n\n【31】Table 5.  Table 5. Comparison of Changes in Blood Pressure before and after 10 Weeks of Supplementation with Fish Oil or Corn Oil.\\*\n\n【32】The subjects in both groups with a high intake of fish had lower base-line mean arterial pressure than those with a low intake of fish (111.5±10.7 vs. 114.8±8.8 mm Hg; P = 0.043) when the values were adjusted for age, sex, and body-mass index. The determinants of base-line mean arterial pressure were analyzed in a multiple regression analysis that included base-line anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables and base-line plasma levels of phospholipid fatty acids. Among these fatty acids, only eicosapentaenoic acid (b = −0.063, P = 0.018) was included in the model (R <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0.12, P = 0.004) as a significant independent predictor of blood pressure. The model predicted a 4.4 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure if plasma levels of phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid increased by 69.6 mg per liter (the mean increase in the fish-oil group during the intervention period; Table 4 ), which is similar to the measured reduction in mean pressure during the period ( Table 5 ).\n\n【33】Change in Blood Pressure during Oil Supplementation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The blood-pressure values during the run-in period and at base line were similar, indicating that a stable level had been reached ( Table 2 ). The subjects receiving fish oil had a significant reduction in systolic (4.6 mm Hg; P = 0.002), diastolic (3.0 mm Hg; P = 0.0002), and mean (3.5 mm Hg; P = 0.002) blood pressure in the sitting position and in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure in the standing position, as compared with base line, at the end of the 10-week intervention period. In contrast, the subjects receiving corn oil had no significant changes in any of these measurements ( Table 5 ). The differences between the two groups were significant for all mean pressure values and all values measured in the sitting and standing positions. No significant interaction was found with sex, age, or body weight. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, usual consumption of fish, change in body weight, intake of energy, dietary fiber, sodium, and calcium, consumption of alcohol, and change in plasma concentrations of phospholipid saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the estimated decrease in the fish-oil group was 5.0 mm Hg (95 percent confidence limits, 2.2 and 7.8) for systolic pressure and 3.1 mm Hg (95 percent confidence limits, 1.4 and 4.8) for diastolic pressure. The adjusted differences between the two groups remained significant for both systolic (6.4 mm Hg; P = 0.0025) and diastolic (2.8 mm Hg; P = 0.029) pressure. In the fish-oil group, 30.8, 16.7, and 20.5 percent of the subjects had reductions in systolic pressure of more than 10 mm Hg, between 5.1 and 10 mm Hg, and between 0.1 and 5 mm Hg, respectively, and 32 percent had no change or an increase. The corresponding figures in the corn-oil group were 11.5, 24.4, 17.9, and 46.2 percent (P = 0.018).\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Changes in Mean Arterial Pressure during the Study, According to Group and Number of Fish Dishes per Week in the Usual Diet.\n\n【36】Each point represents the group mean adjusted for age, sex, smoking (yes or no), and changes in body weight from week 0 to week 10; standard errors of the mean ranged from 1.4 to 1.8. The differences between values at week 0 and the arithmetic means of the measurements at week 5 and week 10 were tested by analysis of variance.\n\n【37】The change in blood pressure differed significantly (P<0.0001) between the subjects with a low intake of fish in the fish-oil group (■—■) and in the corn-oil group (■— —■), but not (P = 0.28) between the subjects with a high intake of fish in the fish-oil group (▲—▲) and in the corn-oil group (▲— —). The change in blood pressure differed significantly between the subjects with high and low intakes of fish within both the fish-oil (P = 0.0008) and the corn-oil (P = 0.048) groups.Figure 2.  Figure 2. Changes in Mean Arterial Pressure during the Study, According to Group and Base-Line Plasma Phospholipid n—3 Fatty Acid Concentrations.\n\n【38】The subgroups are based on the median base-line plasma concentration of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids (the sum of alpha-linolenic, eicosatetraenoic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acid levels), which was 172.6 mg per liter in the corn-oil group and 175.1 mg per liter in the fish-oil group. Each point represents a group mean adjusted for age, sex, smoking (yes or no), and change in body weight from week 0 to week 10; standard errors of the mean ranged from 1.6 to 1.8. The differences between the value at week 0 and the arithmetic mean of the measurements at week 5 and week 10 were tested by analysis of variance. The values for two subjects in the fish-oil group and three in the corn-oil group were not available, and those subjects were not included in these analyses. Squares represent subjects below the group median, and triangles those above. Solid lines represent the fish-oil group, and broken lines the corn-oil group.\n\n【39】The change in blood pressure differed significantly between the subjects below the group median in the fish-oil group and those below the group median in the corn-oil group (P = 0.0024), as well as between the two strata within the fish-oil group (P = 0.016).\n\n【40】The change in blood pressure was related to the amount of fish usually consumed ( Fig. 1 ). The 44 subjects in the fish-oil group with a low intake of fish had a decrease in mean arterial pressure (6.1 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence limits, 8.8 and 3.4; P<0.0001), whereas mean arterial pressure increased in the 34 subjects in the corn-oil group with a low intake of fish (3.1 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence limits, 0.1 and 6.1; P = 0.036). Among the subjects who ate more fish, supplementation with fish oil or corn oil did not change the mean pressure significantly. The validity of these findings was supported by the similar results obtained when the participants were grouped according to base-line plasma concentrations of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids ( Fig. 2 ). A multiple regression analysis was performed within the fish-oil group, with change in blood pressure as the dependent variable and the amount of fish usually consumed, age, weight, sex, smoking habits, and base-line plasma concentrations of phospholipid saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids as independent variables. In this model (R <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0.28, P = 0.0029) fish consumption alone (partial R <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0.19, P = 0.0001) accounted for 67.9 percent of the explained variance.\n\n【41】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Changes in Mean Arterial Pressure during the Study, According to Changes in Plasma Phospholipid n—3 Fatty Acid Concentrations in the Fish-Oil Group.\n\n【42】The values are the mean (+SEM) differences between base-line values and the arithmetic mean of measurements at week 5 and week 10, adjusted for age, sex, smoking (yes or no), and change in body weight (P = 0.027 for linear trend by analysis of variance). The values for two subjects were unavailable and those subjects were not included in these analyses. The changes in plasma phospholipid n—3 fatty acid levels were measured as the percent change (by quartiles) in the sum of alpha-linolenic, eicosatetraenoic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids between base line and 10 weeks.\n\n【43】There was a significant inverse relation between the change in systolic blood pressure and the change in the plasma concentration of phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid in the entire group of 156 subjects analyzed (simple and partial Pearson's correlation coefficients, −0.27 \\[P = 0.0007\\] and −0.32 \\[P = 0.0003\\], respectively). The corresponding figures for the plasma level of phospholipid docosahexaenoic acid were −0.20 (P = 0.014) and −0.29 (P = 0.008). The trends for diastolic blood pressure were similar. In the fish-oil group the change in mean blood pressure was significantly (P = 0.027) related to the change in plasma levels of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】The interactions between dietary nutrients and blood pressure are complex yet highly relevant to contemporary attempts to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The results of this population-based intervention study demonstrate that polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil lower blood pressure in subjects with hypertension. Several lines of evidence support a causal relation between the dietary intake of fish oil and blood pressure. First, the study hypothesis was confirmed in a randomized trial. Second, the change in blood pressure was related to the change in plasma concentrations of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids. Third, there was a significant association between plasma concentrations of phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid and blood pressure. Fourth, the frequency of fish consumption predicted both base-line blood pressure and the response to supplementation.\n\n【46】The biologically active component of fish oil that reduces blood pressure is not known with certainty. We found that a mixture of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids lowered blood pressure. Although there was an association between the change in blood pressure and that in plasma concentrations of both phospholipid docosahexaenoic acid and phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid, base-line blood pressure was related only to the latter. Our results thus indicate that eicosapentaenoic acid is more important in lowering blood pressure.\n\n【47】Our results further suggest that n—3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplied as ethyl esters have a lowering effect on blood pressure that is quantitatively similar to the effect of those supplied as part of the usual diet. It has recently been reported that eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester is absorbed to the same extent as the triglyceride form. <sup><a>30 </a></sup> The apparently poor absorption reported in single-dose experiments <sup><a>31 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>32 </a></sup> probably reflects differences in the hydrolytic rate and tissue distribution of the ethyl and glycerol esters.\n\n【48】There was a slight increase in body weight (<1 percent) in both groups during the study. Weight gain has been reported in both dietary-supplementation and dietary-replacement studies using fish oil. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>19 </a></sup> It is not likely that the small amount of extra energy supplied by the supplement used in this study caused the increase in weight; other possible explanations include changes in the absorption or utilization of other nutrients and factors outside the study, such as seasonal variation.\n\n【49】Previous intervention studies have demonstrated that fish oils have hypotensive effects, in both normotensive <sup><a>10 </a></sup> <sup><a>11 </a></sup> <sup><a>12 </a></sup> <sup><a>13 </a></sup> <sup><a>14 </a></sup> and hypertensive <sup><a>15 </a></sup> <sup><a>16 </a></sup> <sup><a>17 </a></sup> <sup><a>18 </a></sup> subjects. In one open study in nonsmoking white men with hypertension, <sup><a>15 </a></sup> 1.8 g of eicosapentaenoic acid per day did not lower blood pressure, whereas 9 g per day lowered systolic pressure by 6.5 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 4.4 mm Hg. We reanalyzed our results using the same <sup><a>15 </a></sup> inclusion criteria (including only the men who consumed fewer than three fish dishes a week) and found that systolic pressure decreased by 11.2 mm Hg (P = 0.028) and diastolic pressure by 5.6 mm Hg (P = 0.013) in 9 men receiving fish oil, as compared with no change in 11 similar men receiving corn oil. Although the results of this subgroup analysis should be interpreted cautiously, they suggest that little additional lowering effect can be expected from increasing the dose of eicosapentaenoic acid from 3.3 g to 9 g per day. Furthermore, 1.8 g per day may be insufficient to achieve any effect at all, although this may depend on the composition of the usual diet.\n\n【50】The efficacy of fish-oil supplements in reducing blood pressure may vary in different demographic and biochemical subgroups of patients with hypertension. We found that 32 percent of the subjects receiving fish oil had no reduction in blood pressure despite an increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid. As shown in Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , part of the variation in blood-pressure response was related to the specific dietary and biochemical characteristics of the subjects. Those following a diet lower in fish and those with low plasma concentrations of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids were particularly likely to benefit from fish-oil supplements. To study further potential differences between the subjects receiving fish oil who responded and those who did not, we compared those who had a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg (n = 24) with those who had no change or an increase in blood pressure (n = 25). The subjects who responded to supplementation were less likely to eat fatty fish (P = 0.024), had higher base-line plasma concentrations of phospholipid monounsaturated (P = 0.041) and saturated (P = 0.058) fatty acids, and had a larger reduction in plasma levels of phospholipid n—6 fatty acids during the study (P = 0.059). We found no relation between the dietary intake of sodium, calcium, or fiber and the response to fish-oil supplements. This may imply that the amount or quality of dietary fat (or both) modifies the lowering effect of fish oil on blood pressure. It is tempting to speculate that a low ratio of n—3 to n—6 fatty acids in biologic membranes is associated with increased susceptibility to hypertension, and that blood pressure may be reduced in such persons by raising the n—3:n—6 ratio.\n\n【51】The effect of n—6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on blood pressure is controversial. Linoleic acid has been reported to decrease <sup><a>33 </a></sup> as well as to increase <sup><a>34 </a></sup> blood pressure, and to have no effect. <sup><a>35 </a></sup> Our study suggests that linoleic acid may increase blood pressure in patients with a low intake of n—3 fatty acids, but that it has little effect in those with a high intake of n—3 fatty acids ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【52】We have demonstrated that dietary enrichment with 6 g per day of 85 percent eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids can lower blood pressure in subjects with hypertension. The blood-pressure response was related to change in plasma levels of phospholipid n—3 fatty acids. This relation implies that in addition to its potential benefits through other physiologic mechanisms, <sup><a>36 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>37 </a></sup> fish oil may be helpful in treating hypertension.\n\n【53】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【54】Supported by the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities, the Norwegian Fishermen Sales Organization, and Norsk Hydro; the screening was carried out in cooperation with the National Health Screening Service, Oslo, Norway.\n\n【55】We are indebted to our study participants for their cooperation; to Mrs. Beate Packalen, study secretary; to Mrs. Åse Borgejordet, who organized the dietary recall; to Mrs. Merethe Mack and Mrs. Birgit Svensson for technical assistance; to Dr. Ole C.

Even though there are embryos available for transfer in about 85 percent of the treatment cycles, the rate of pregnancy rarely exceeds 25 percent per cycle. We designed this study to investigate two questions: Does this high rate of failure result from inadequate technique, or does it simply reflect the maximal potential of a cohort of aspirated eggs to produce a pregnancy? And to what extent does cryopreservation affect the capacity for implantation of embryos?\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】The study was conducted among patients enrolled in an egg-donation program. Aspirated eggs from a given cohort were distributed to the donor herself and a few recipients. The recipients were prepared by a standard protocol of hormone replacement and were assigned at random to the transfer of either fresh or frozen and thawed embryos. The donors received only fresh embryos.\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】Forty cycles of donation were studied. In 25 cycles (63 percent) pregnancy was established in the donor, in the recipient (or recipients), or in both. Of the fresh embryos that were transferred to the recipients, 24 percent were successfully implanted, as compared with only 7.7 percent of the frozen and thawed embryos (P<0.01). A pregnancy success rate of 37 percent per recipient cycle was observed in the recipients of fresh embryos, as compared with a rate of only 16 percent in those receiving frozen and thawed embryos (P<0.05).\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】The majority of egg cohorts evidently possess the potential to produce a pregnancy, but cryopreservation of human embryos significantly reduces their capacity for implantation. (N Engl J Med 1990; 323: 1153–6.)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】IN VITRO fertilization has become a routine procedure for the treatment of infertility, with a pregnancy success rate in many centers of 20 to 25 percent per egg collection. Considerable effort has been invested in improving laboratory procedures, methods of oocyte retrieval, and techniques of ovarian stimulation, without marked improvement in treatment results. It is not clear that a pregnancy success rate of 25 percent is the highest that can be expected. The rate depends on the potential of the retrieved eggs to produce pregnancy. In the framework of routine in vitro fertilization, it has been impossible to design and carry out an effective study of the pregnancy-producing potential of retrieved eggs, because it has been impossible to identify, isolate, and control for the numerous variables, including the different protocols used for ovarian stimulation, the quality of the sperm used, the receptivity of the uterus, and the use of cryopreservation.\n\n【12】An opportunity to control for some of these variables emerged from our program of egg donation, begun in 1985, in which a cohort of eggs retrieved from a donor is distributed among a group of recipients including the donor herself. Consequently, eggs from a single retrieval procedure are inseminated by different samples of semen, and the resulting embryos are transferred into different uteri. As a result, the eggs are subjected to various conditions, so that the possible effects of semen, endometrial environment, or both are controlled for. In this study, we investigated the effects of the various conditions on the rate of pregnancy, calculated per cohort of eggs. The rates we obtained may reflect the potential of a cohort to result in pregnancy.\n\n【13】Using the same model, we also studied the effect of cryopreservation on the implantation of embryos. The cryopreservation of human embryos is now a routine procedure in many programs of in vitro fertilization. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> <sup><a>2 </a></sup> <sup><a>3 </a></sup> <sup><a>4 </a></sup> Its reported benefits include an increased chance of pregnancy from a single oocyte-recovery procedure <sup><a>1 </a></sup> and a reduced risk of multiple pregnancy. Although this reduced risk would appear to be an obvious outcome of cryopreservation, it is debatable whether the chances of pregnancy per oocyte recovery are increased, especially since some embryos are likely to be damaged during cryopreservation itself. A correlation was recently reported between some morphologic features as seen on video recordings after cryopreserved embryos had been thawed and their capacity for implantation. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> Very little is known about the capacity for implantation and the extent to which it may depend on the quality of the embryos or the suitability of the uterine environment. Nor is it known whether freezing and thawing affect the capacity of embryos for implantation.\n\n【14】In a program of egg donation, cryopreservation offers a way to match the age of the embryo with the state of the recipient's endometrium. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> The same result can be achieved with fresh embryos, however, by applying various means of synchronization. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>8 </a></sup> Our model of egg donation, in which embryos are transferred under similar conditions — either fresh or after freezing and thawing — into similarly prepared uterine environments, provided an opportunity to examine the effect of cryopreservation on the rate of implantation.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Egg Donors\n----------\n\n【17】In Israel the donation of oocytes is permitted only by healthy patients who have no detectable genetic diseases and who are themselves undergoing in vitro fertilization because of infertility. For our study, potential donors who fulfilled these criteria were asked to donate one third of their aspirated eggs. It was explained before they signed a consent form that such a donation might diminish their own chances of conceiving to some extent. The donors were given no information about the identity of the recipients or the fate of the donated eggs, and the identity of the donors was not known to the recipients.\n\n【18】Recipients\n----------\n\n【19】The recipients were mainly women with primary ovarian failure, with a normal uterus and an adequate endometrial response to hormone replacement therapy (as judged by endometrial biopsies). Results of the husband's sperm analysis were normal in each case. All the recipients and their husbands gave written informed consent, including a statement that the newborn would be acknowledged as their own, regardless of any complications.\n\n【20】Hormone Replacement Therapy\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Estradiol valerate was administered, initially at a dose of 1 mg per day. The dose was increased by 1 mg every day for the next five days. The dose was then reduced to 2 mg per day, and it was maintained at that level for the remainder of the cycle. On the second day of the maintenance dose of estradiol, 100 mg of progesterone per day was added, given in vaginal suppositories. This day was considered to correspond to the day of egg retrieval in the donors.\n\n【22】Ovarian Stimulation, Oocyte Retrieval, and Laboratory and Freezing Techniques\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Two protocols of ovarian stimulation were used in the donors. In the first, 3.2 mg of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (D-Trp-6, decapeptyl depot controlled release, Ferring, Malmö, Sweden) was given on day 21 of the natural cycle, followed two weeks later by 225 IU of human menopausal gonadotropin (Teva, Kefar Sava, Israel) per day. In the second, 225 IU of human menopausal gonadotropin a day was given starting on the third day of the natural cycle. In both protocols, human chorionic gonadotropin (Chorigon, Teva) was injected after six days of increased serum estradiol levels, <sup><a>7 </a></sup> provided that the largest follicle reached 18 mm in diameter and estradiol levels were higher than 1835.5 pmol per liter (about 500 pg per milliliter). Oocytes were retrieved by ultrasonographically guided vaginal puncture and were cultured in modified Earle's medium. The method of freezing and thawing was that of Lassalle et al. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> At the stage of two to four cells, the embryos were dehydrated with propylene glycol and 0.1 M sucrose and then frozen in a programmed freezer (Planer, Sunbury on Thames, U.K.). Rapid thawing was performed in the presence of 0.2 M sucrose.\n\n【24】Synchronization of Cycles for the Transfer of Fresh Embryos\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】In cycles selected for the transfer of fresh embryos, we synchronized the cycles of the recipients with that of the donor, using the so-called six-day rule, <sup><a>7 </a></sup> which suggests that the median duration of the increase in estradiol during the follicular phase is six days. Hence, the recipients started to receive estradiol valerate on the day an increase was first noted in the donor. Exogenous progesterone was begun in the recipients on the day of egg retrieval.\n\n【26】Synchronization of Cycles for the Transfer of Cryopreserved Embryos\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】All embryos allocated for cryopreservation were frozen, regardless of their morphologic features. The recipients were treated with the same hormone-replacement protocol as those awaiting the transfer of fresh embryos. The cryopreserved embryos were thawed and transferred on the third day of progesterone therapy, which corresponded hormonally with 48 hours after egg retrieval in the donors.\n\n【28】Study Protocol\n--------------\n\n【29】Thirty-two donors were treated in 40 donation cycles. The donated oocytes were distributed among 57 recipients treated in 84 cycles. Donation cycles were randomly assigned to the transfer of fresh embryos or cryopreservation. Two thirds of a donor's retrieved eggs were set aside for the donor herself, and the remaining one third was allocated to one or more recipients. The eggs thus allocated were then inseminated by the semen of the recipient's husband. Eggs originating from the same cohort were thus inseminated by different semen, and the resulting embryos, either fresh or after cryopreservation, were transferred into different uteri whose environments had all been prepared in the same way. There was no selection of embryos for freezing, and after thawing, all embryos that were not degenerating were transferred. In the donors all the available embryos were transferred fresh during the hyperstimulated cycles. In this study we defined pregnancy as any instance of established pregnancy, regardless of the number of embryos implanted. Implantation refers to the total number of implanted embryos. Embryos transferred were those that were judged suitable for replacement.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Table 1.  Table 1. Donor Age, Number of Aspirated Eggs per Cycle, and Fertilization Rate in Donor Cycles Resulting in Pregnancy as Compared with Those Failing to Produce Pregnancy.\\*\n\n【32】Of 40 consecutive cycles of egg donation, pregnancy was established in 25 (63 percent). In 9 cycles (23 percent) either the donor or the donor plus the recipient (or recipients) conceived, and in 16 cycles (40 percent) only the recipient (or recipients) conceived. As shown in Table 1 , there were no differences in the mean age of the donors, mean number of eggs aspirated per retrieval procedure, or rate of fertilization between the donor cycles that resulted in pregnancy and those that did not. The donors were treated for mechanical infertility (26 cycles), unexplained infertility (9 cycles), endometriosis (3 cycles), and male infertility (3 cycles). Eggs from 18 cycles in women with mechanical infertility produced pregnancies (69 percent) in the donors, recipients, or both. Eggs from three cycles in women with unexplained infertility led to pregnancy (33 percent), and from one cycle in a woman with endometriosis (33 percent). All three cycles involving treatment for male infertility led to pregnancies in the recipients (100 percent).\n\n【33】Table 2.  Table 2. Comparison of Donor Cycles According to Whether Embryos Were Transferred Fresh or Frozen and Thawed.\\*\n\n【34】With respect to cryopreservation, of the 40 cycles of egg donation, 17 were synchronized for the transfer of fresh embryos to recipients other than the donor, and 13 of these (76 percent) resulted in pregnancy in the donors or the recipients ( Table 2 ). Embryos from the other 23 cycles were cryopreserved, and they produced pregnancies in 12 cycles in the recipients (52 percent). (Donors received only fresh embryos.) The mean age of the donors was similar in the two groups.\n\n【35】Table 3.  Table 3. Treatment Results in Recipient Cycles Synchronized for the Transfer of Fresh Embryos, as Compared with Those Synchronized for the Transfer of Frozen and Thawed Embryos.\\*\n\n【36】The results of treatment in the recipients are shown in Table 3 . The mean number of oocytes and the rate of fertilization were similar in the recipient cycles synchronized for the transfer of fresh embryos and those synchronized for the transfer of cryopreserved embryos. The implantation rate of fresh embryos, however, was significantly higher than that of frozen and thawed embryos (24 vs. 7.7 percent, P<0.01). Moreover, the rate of pregnancy in the group receiving fresh embryos was also significantly higher (37 vs. 15 percent, P<0.05).\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】The relatively low rate of implantation (9 to 11 percent) in most in vitro fertilization programs may be attributable to several factors associated with the procedure — the eggs, the sperm, the endometrium, and the laboratory techniques. Probably all these factors contribute in some measure to the unsatisfactory success rate of in vitro fertilization. In order to improve the rate of pregnancy, more information is needed about the contribution of each variable to the theoretical potential for pregnancy, but in the framework of a routine in vitro fertilization program it is not possible to separate the relative contributions. The use of cryopreservation permits some flexibility in the time between in vitro fertilization and the transfer of embryos, but it introduces new hazards to the embryo. Moreover, technical and ethical problems make it difficult to evaluate the results of cryopreservation of human embryos for the following reasons: embryos are in most cases preselected for cryopreservation, and normally only those with good morphologic features are considered; embryos damaged during cryopreservation are not transferred, so they are usually not included in the analysis of results; and there is no proper control group for studying the effect of cryopreservation on the implantation of embryos, because the embryos with the best morphologic features are chosen for fresh transfer during the stimulation cycle. In our study most of these difficulties were eliminated: eggs were randomly allocated for donation; there was no selection of embryos before freezing; endometria were prepared with identical protocols; and all frozen embryos were thawed and transferred regardless of morphologic features. The significantly lower rate of implantation in frozen and thawed embryos (7.7 percent) as compared with fresh embryos (24 percent) can thus be attributed to the use of cryopreservation.\n\n【39】Our experimental design made it possible to isolate the potential contributions of poor-quality sperm and nonreceptive endometria to the failure of implantation, because more than one sample of semen was used for each cohort of eggs, and the resulting embryos were transferred into more than one uterus. In this way we could come closer to determining the actual potential of a cohort of aspirated eggs to produce pregnancy. Our findings indicate that most (63 percent) of the cohorts aspirated in this study could result in pregnancy when provided with favorable conditions (sperm of good quality and a properly stimulated endometrium). It should be noted that the embryos from more than half the cohorts in this series were cryopreserved, resulting in a lower rate of pregnancy (52 percent). The true potential of these egg cohorts was thus probably higher than the rate of 63 percent we obtained. When only fresh embryos were transferred, 76 percent of the egg cohorts produced a pregnancy. This pregnancy rate of 76 percent is in accord with our findings in a previous series of egg-donation cycles, in which only fresh embryos were transferred and 84 percent of the cohorts produced a pregnancy. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> The high rate of pregnancy per cohort may be partly explained by the nature of egg donation itself: embryos that are foreign to the mother may be more effective in evoking an immune response required for implantation. Our finding that fresh embryos were implanted better in the recipients than in the donors may be also due to an immune phenomenon. A possible contribution of unrecognized male factors cannot be excluded, however, since simple semen analysis does not fully correlate with male fertility. It is also possible that an excess of embryos in the donors may actually decrease the chances of pregnancy, since multiple oocytes are most often the product of a cycle with high levels of estradiol and progesterone. The resulting overstimulation of the endometrium could be detrimental to implantation.\n\n【40】The findings of our study indicate that, at least in cases of egg donation, a better rate of pregnancy can be achieved using protocols of synchronization based on the transfer of fresh embryos. In contrast to this program, in which no more than three embryos were available for transfer to a recipient, a routine program of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer might make more embryos available for transfer. The possible benefits of transferring fresh embryos could thus be complicated by the risks of multiple implantations, currently the main cause of perinatal morbidity in pregnancies involving in vitro fertilization. Acosta et al. <sup><a>10 </a></sup> studied the effect of the number of embryos transferred on the chances of multiple implantation. They reported that in 81 patients with multiple pregnancy resulting from in vitro fertilization, 2.2 embryos per cycle were able to establish a normal pregnancy, regardless of the number of \"preembryos\" transferred. These findings indicate that the transfer of five embryos rather than three or four does not necessarily increase the chance of multiple pregnancy. On the other hand, two thirds of the frozen and thawed embryos in our study lost their potential to establish a pregnancy. When the number of embryos to be used in fresh transfer is being determined, both points should be kept in mind. In the absence of more reliable ways to predict the potential of a given embryo for pregnancy, the morphologic features of the blastomeres could be taken as a possible guideline. Unless there are at least two or three morphologically sound embryos available for fresh transfer, we recommend that no embryos be allocated to cryopreservation.\n\n【41】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【42】From the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer (D.L., J.D., E.R.), and the Department of Embryology and Teratology (D.L., L.N.), Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv (D.L., J.D., E.R., L.N., I.B.-S., Z.B.-R., S.M.), both in Israel.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia ranges from 0.02 to 0.07 case per patient–month, including episodic recurrence in approximately 20 percent of patients. <sup><a>1-3 </a></sup> Since 1990, we have identified 16 patients (15 girls and 1 boy) who had more than three comas within three months, all of whom admitted, generally years later, that they had secretly self-administered large doses of regular insulin. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 12.9±0.5 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 6.2±0.7 years, and the mean level of glycosylated hemoglobin was 8.1±0.3 percent.\n\n【3】Patients secretly administering injections to themselves had a high frequency of familial dysfunction (8 of 16 patients), and they claimed that the official insulin dose was below 0.5 unit per kilogram per day (9 of 16 patients). An inexperienced pediatric diabetologist diagnosed Munchausen syndrome by proxy in one of the patients, and the error was echoed by the justice system, with serious consequences for the family. Child psychiatrists considered 15 of the 16 patients to be normal and 1 to be psychotic. Seven patients, judged to have marked psychological dysfunction in their families, deliberately used secret injections to induce coma; they said that they did so to get the attention of the medical staff with the aim of obtaining help. Five other patients used secret injections to normalize their blood glucose levels, in response to parents' extreme fear of complications. Four other patients used secret injections to mask poor metabolic control (indicated by weight loss, hyperglycemia, or ketosis) when they felt they had gone too far in omitting insulin doses.\n\n【4】We found no specific feature that reliably identified those with secret insulin-injection syndrome among the many adolescents treated with insulin who had repeated hypoglycemic coma. We would suggest that all children who have more than two comas within a three-month period should be hospitalized to allow them and their parents to have in-depth discussions with physicians, nurses, and psychiatrists. The medical team must explain the risks associated with repeated coma. The pediatric diabetologist should make clear that secret insulin-injection syndrome is suspected as the cause of coma. Faced with denial and arguments, the diabetologist should not struggle with the patient to obtain “the truth.” The adolescent involved is usually very anxious and needs both medical and psychiatric help. A firm and comprehensive diagnosis seems to be the key to preventing recurrence. Secret insulin-injection syndrome is a serious condition that may lead to medical and judicial errors, complications, or even death.\n\n【5】Pierre Bougnères, M.D., Ph.D.  \nPascal Boileau, M.D., Ph.D.  \nBrigitte Aboumrad  \nHôpital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, 75014 Paris, France  \npierre.  bougneres@paris5.  inserm.  fr\n\n【6】3 References\n\n【7】1.  1\\.

The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer \\[GMT\\], 40,227 in the 25-μg group, 109,209 in the 100-μg group, and 213,526 in the 250-μg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-μg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04283461 . opens in new tab ).\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). <sup><a>1 </a></sup> The urgent need for vaccines prompted an international response, with more than 120 candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development within the first 5 months of 2020. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)–based vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in its prefusion conformation. The S glycoprotein mediates host cell attachment and is required for viral entry <sup><a>3 </a></sup> ; it is the primary vaccine target for many candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. <sup><a>4-7</a></sup>\n\n【12】We conducted a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Here we report interim results of the trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Design and Participants\n-----------------------------\n\n【15】We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial designed to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Eligible participants were healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age who received two injections of trial vaccine 28 days apart at a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. On the basis of the results obtained in patients at these dose levels, additional groups were added to the protocol; those results will be reported in a subsequent publication. Participants were not screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by serology or polymerase chain reaction before enrollment. The trial was conducted at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. The protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, permitted interim analyses to inform decisions regarding vaccine strategy and public health; this interim analysis reports findings through day 57. Full details of the trial design, conduct, oversight, and analyses can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (available at NEJM.org).\n\n【16】The trial was reviewed and approved by the Advarra institutional review board, which functioned as a single board and was overseen by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was conducted under an Investigational New Drug application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine was codeveloped by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, the trial sponsor) and at Moderna (Cambridge, MA). Moderna was involved in discussions of the trial design, provided the vaccine candidate, and, as part of the writing group, contributed to drafting the manuscript. The Emmes Company, as a subcontractor to the NIAID, served as the statistical and data coordinating center, developed the statistical analysis plan, and performed the analyses. The manuscript was written entirely by the authors, with the first author as the overall lead author, the fourth author as the lead NIAID author, and the last two authors as senior authors (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). The authors had full access to the data reports, which were prepared from the raw data by the statistical and data coordinating center, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【17】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【18】The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate, manufactured by Moderna, encodes the S-2P antigen, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein with a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1–S2 cleavage site. S-2P is stabilized in its prefusion conformation by two consecutive proline substitutions at amino acid positions 986 and 987, at the top of the central helix in the S2 subunit. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> The lipid nanoparticle capsule composed of four lipids was formulated in a fixed ratio of mRNA and lipid. The mRNA-1273 vaccine was provided as a sterile liquid for injection at a concentration of 0.5 mg per milliliter. Normal saline was used as a diluent to prepare the doses administered.\n\n【19】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【20】The vaccine was administered as a 0.5-ml injection in the deltoid muscle on days 1 and 29; follow-up visits were scheduled for 7 and 14 days after each vaccination and on days 57, 119, 209, and 394. The dose-escalation plan specified enrollment of four sentinel participants in the 25-μg group, followed by four sentinel participants in the 100-μg group, followed by full enrollment of those two dose groups. If no halting rules were met after all participants in those two dose groups completed day 8, four sentinel participants in the 250-μg group were enrolled, followed by the remainder of that dose group.\n\n【21】Participants recorded local and systemic reactions, using a memory aid, for 7 days after each vaccination. Participants were not instructed to routinely use acetaminophen or other analgesics or antipyretics before or after the vaccinations but were asked to record any new medications taken. Adverse events were graded according to a standard toxicity grading scale (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). <sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【22】Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Binding Antibody and Neutralizing Responses\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Binding antibody responses against S-2P and the isolated receptor-binding domain, located in the S1 subunit, were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vaccine-induced neutralizing activity was assessed by a pseudotyped lentivirus reporter single-round-of-infection neutralization assay (PsVNA) and by live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) assay. ELISA and PsVNA were performed on specimens collected from all participants on days 1, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57. Because of the time-intensive nature of the PRNT assay, for this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the day 1 and day 43 time points in the 25-μg and 100-μg dose groups.\n\n【24】For comparison of the participants’ immune responses with those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 convalescent serum specimens were also tested. The assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (ELISA and PsVNA) and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (PRNT).\n\n【25】Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 T-Cell Responses\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【26】T-cell responses against the spike protein were assessed by an intracellular cytokine–staining assay, performed on specimens collected at days 1, 29, and 43. For this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the 25-μg and 100-μg dose groups. These assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. (See the Supplementary Appendix for details of all assay methods and for characteristics of the convalescent serum specimens.)\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Results of immunogenicity testing of the 45 enrolled participants excluded findings for day 36, day 43, and day 57 for 3 participants who did not receive the second vaccination and for time points at which specimens were not collected (in the 100-μg group: 1 participant at day 43 and day 57; in the 250-μg group: 1 participant at day 29 and 1 at day 57). Confidence intervals of the geometric means were calculated with the Student’s t distribution on log-transformed data. Seroconversion as measured by ELISA was defined as an increase by a factor of 4 or more in antibody titer over baseline.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【31】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Participants in the mRNA-1273 Trial at Enrollment.\n\n【32】The 45 enrolled participants received their first vaccination between March 16 and April 14, 2020 (Fig. S1). Three participants did not receive the second vaccination, including one in the 25-μg group who had urticaria on both legs, with onset 5 days after the first vaccination, and two (one in the 25-μg group and one in the 250-μg group) who missed the second vaccination window owing to isolation for suspected Covid-19 while the test results, ultimately negative, were pending. All continued to attend scheduled trial visits. The demographic characteristics of participants at enrollment are provided in Table 1 .\n\n【33】Vaccine Safety\n--------------\n\n【34】No serious adverse events were noted, and no prespecified trial halting rules were met. As noted above, one participant in the 25-μg group was withdrawn because of an unsolicited adverse event, transient urticaria, judged to be related to the first vaccination.\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Systemic and Local Adverse Events.\n\n【36】The severity of solicited adverse events was graded as mild, moderate, or severe (see Table S1).\n\n【37】After the first vaccination, solicited systemic adverse events were reported by 5 participants (33%) in the 25-μg group, 10 (67%) in the 100-μg group, and 8 (53%) in the 250-μg group; all were mild or moderate in severity ( Figure 1 and Table S2). Solicited systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination and occurred in 7 of 13 participants (54%) in the 25-μg group, all 15 in the 100-μg group, and all 14 in the 250-μg group, with 3 of those participants (21%) reporting one or more severe events.\n\n【38】None of the participants had fever after the first vaccination. After the second vaccination, no participants in the 25-μg group, 6 (40%) in the 100-μg group, and 8 (57%) in the 250-μg group reported fever; one of the events (maximum temperature, 39.6°C) in the 250-μg group was graded severe. (Additional details regarding adverse events for that participant are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .)\n\n【39】Local adverse events, when present, were nearly all mild or moderate, and pain at the injection site was common. Across both vaccinations, solicited systemic and local adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern ( Supplementary Appendix and Table S3).\n\n【40】SARS-CoV-2 Binding Antibody Responses\n-------------------------------------\n\n【41】Table 2. Table 2. Geometric Mean Humoral Immunogenicity Assay Responses to mRNA-1273 in Participants and in Convalescent Serum Specimens. Figure 2.  Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 Antibody and Neutralization Responses.\n\n【42】Shown are geometric mean reciprocal end-point enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG titers to S-2P (Panel A) and receptor-binding domain (Panel B), PsVNA ID <sub>50 </sub> responses (Panel C), and live virus PRNT <sub>80 </sub> responses (Panel D). In Panel A and Panel B, boxes and horizontal bars denote interquartile range (IQR) and median area under the curve (AUC), respectively. Whisker endpoints are equal to the maximum and minimum values below or above the median ±1.5 times the IQR. The convalescent serum panel includes specimens from 41 participants; red dots indicate the 3 specimens that were also tested in the PRNT assay. The other 38 specimens were used to calculate summary statistics for the box plot in the convalescent serum panel. In Panel C, boxes and horizontal bars denote IQR and median ID <sub>50 </sub> , respectively. Whisker end points are equal to the maximum and minimum values below or above the median ±1.5 times the IQR. In the convalescent serum panel, red dots indicate the 3 specimens that were also tested in the PRNT assay. The other 38 specimens were used to calculate summary statistics for the box plot in the convalescent panel. In Panel D, boxes and horizontal bars denote IQR and median PRNT <sub>80 </sub> , respectively. Whisker end points are equal to the maximum and minimum values below or above the median ±1.5 times the IQR. The three convalescent serum specimens were also tested in ELISA and PsVNA assays. Because of the time-intensive nature of the PRNT assay, for this preliminary report, PRNT results were available only for the 25-μg and 100-μg dose groups.\n\n【43】Binding antibody IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) to S-2P increased rapidly after the first vaccination, with seroconversion in all participants by day 15 ( Table 2 and Figure 2A ). Dose-dependent responses to the first and second vaccinations were evident. Receptor-binding domain–specific antibody responses were similar in pattern and magnitude ( Figure 2B ). For both assays, the median magnitude of antibody responses after the first vaccination in the 100-μg and 250-μg dose groups was similar to the median magnitude in convalescent serum specimens, and in all dose groups the median magnitude after the second vaccination was in the upper quartile of values in the convalescent serum specimens. The S-2P ELISA GMTs at day 57 (299,751 \\[95% confidence interval {CI}, 206,071 to 436,020\\] in the 25-μg group, 782,719 \\[95% CI, 619,310 to 989,244\\] in the 100-μg group, and 1,192,154 \\[95% CI, 924,878 to 1,536,669\\] in the 250-μg group) exceeded that in the convalescent serum specimens (142,140 \\[95% CI, 81,543 to 247,768\\]).\n\n【44】SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Responses\n-----------------------------------\n\n【45】No participant had detectable PsVNA responses before vaccination. After the first vaccination, PsVNA responses were detected in less than half the participants, and a dose effect was seen (50% inhibitory dilution \\[ID <sub>50 </sub> \\]: Figure 2C , Fig. S8, and Table 2 ; 80% inhibitory dilution \\[ID <sub>80 </sub> \\]: Fig. S2 and Table S6). However, after the second vaccination, PsVNA responses were identified in serum samples from all participants. The lowest responses were in the 25-μg dose group, with a geometric mean ID <sub>50 </sub> of 112.3 (95% CI, 71.2 to 177.1) at day 43; the higher responses in the 100-μg and 250-μg groups were similar in magnitude (geometric mean ID <sub>50 </sub> , 343.8 \\[95% CI, 261.2 to 452.7\\] and 332.2 \\[95% CI, 266.3 to 414.5\\], respectively, at day 43). These responses were similar to values in the upper half of the distribution of values for convalescent serum specimens.\n\n【46】Before vaccination, no participant had detectable 80% live-virus neutralization at the highest serum concentration tested (1:8 dilution) in the PRNT assay. At day 43, wild-type virus–neutralizing activity capable of reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by 80% or more (PRNT <sub>80 </sub> ) was detected in all participants, with geometric mean PRNT <sub>80 </sub> responses of 339.7 (95% CI, 184.0 to 627.1) in the 25-μg group and 654.3 (95% CI, 460.1 to 930.5) in the 100-μg group ( Figure 2D ). Neutralizing PRNT <sub>80 </sub> average responses were generally at or above the values of the three convalescent serum specimens tested in this assay. Good agreement was noted within and between the values from binding assays for S-2P and receptor-binding domain and neutralizing activity measured by PsVNA and PRNT (Figs. S3 through S7), which provides orthogonal support for each assay in characterizing the humoral response induced by mRNA-1273.\n\n【47】SARS-CoV-2 T-Cell Responses\n---------------------------\n\n【48】The 25-μg and 100-μg doses elicited CD4 T-cell responses (Figs. S9 and S10) that on stimulation by S-specific peptide pools were strongly biased toward expression of Th1 cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α > interleukin 2 > interferon γ), with minimal type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) cytokine expression (interleukin 4 and interleukin 13). CD8 T-cell responses to S-2P were detected at low levels after the second vaccination in the 100-μg dose group (Fig. S11).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We report interim findings from this phase 1 clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine encoding a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, S-2P. Experience with the mRNA platform for other candidate vaccines and rapid manufacturing allowed the deployment of a first-in-human clinical vaccine candidate in record time. Product development processes that normally require years <sup><a>10 </a></sup> were finished in about 2 months. Vaccine development was initiated after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was posted on January 10, 2020; manufacture and delivery of clinical trials material was completed within 45 days, and the first trial participants were vaccinated on March 16, 2020, just 66 days after the genomic sequence of the virus was posted. The accelerated timeline generated key interim data necessary to launch advanced large-scale clinical trials within 6 months after initial awareness of a new pandemic threat.\n\n【51】The two-dose vaccine series was generally without serious toxicity; systemic adverse events after the first vaccination, when reported, were all graded mild or moderate. Greater reactogenicity followed the second vaccination, particularly in the 250-μg group. Across the three dose groups, local injection-site reactions were primarily mild. This descriptive safety profile is similar to that described in a report of two trials of avian influenza mRNA vaccines (influenza A/H10N8 and influenza A/H7N9) that were manufactured by Moderna with the use of an earlier lipid nanoparticle capsule formulation <sup><a>11 </a></sup> and is consistent with an interim report of a phase 1–2 evaluation of a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine encoding the S receptor-binding domain. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> Those studies showed that solicited systemic adverse events tended to be more frequent and more severe with higher doses and after the second vaccination.\n\n【52】The mRNA-1273 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing robust binding antibody responses to both full-length S-2P and receptor-binding domain in all participants after the first vaccination in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Commensurately high neutralizing antibody responses were also elicited in a dose-dependent fashion. Seroconversion was rapid for binding antibodies, occurring within 2 weeks after the first vaccination, but pseudovirus neutralizing activity was low before the second vaccination, which supports the need for a two-dose vaccination schedule. It is important to note that both binding and neutralizing antibody titers induced by the two-dose schedule were similar to those found in convalescent serum specimens. However, interpretation of the significance of those comparisons must account for the variability in Covid-19 convalescent antibody titers according to factors such as patient age, disease severity, and time since disease onset and for the number of samples in the panel. <sup><a>12,13</a></sup>\n\n【53】Though correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection have not yet been determined, measurement of serum neutralizing activity has been shown to be a mechanistic correlate of protection for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza <sup><a>14 </a></sup> and respiratory syncytial virus, <sup><a>15 </a></sup> and is generally accepted as a functional biomarker of the in vivo humoral response. <sup><a>16 </a></sup> In rhesus macaques given DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. <sup><a>17 </a></sup> Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been associated with vaccine-induced protection against challenge <sup><a>18 </a></sup> or subsequent rechallenge after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model. <sup><a>19 </a></sup> We found strong correlations between the binding and neutralization assays and between the live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assays. The latter finding suggests that the pseudovirus neutralization assay, performed under biosafety level 2 containment, may, when validated, serve as a relevant surrogate for live virus neutralization, which requires biosafety level 3 containment. In humans, phase 3 efficacy trials will allow assessment of the correlation of vaccine-induced immune responses with clinical protection.\n\n【54】In this interim report of follow-up of participants through day 57, we were not able to assess the durability of the immune responses; however, participants will be followed for 1 year after the second vaccination with scheduled blood collections throughout that period to characterize the humoral and cellular immunologic responses. This longitudinal assessment is relevant given that natural history studies suggest that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infections, particularly mild illnesses, may not generate long-lived antibody responses. <sup><a>20-22</a></sup>\n\n【55】The rapid and robust immunogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine most likely results from an innovative structure-based vaccine antigen design, <sup><a>23 </a></sup> coupled with a potent lipid-nanoparticle delivery system, and the use of modified nucleotides that avoid early intracellular activation of interferon-associated genes. These features of the mRNA composition and formulation have been associated with prolonged protein expression, induction of antigen-specific T-follicular helper cells, and activation of germinal center B cells. <sup><a>24 </a></sup> Stabilizing coronavirus spike proteins by substituting two prolines at the top of heptad repeat 1 prevents structural rearrangements of the fusion (S2) subunit. This has enabled the determination of atomic-level structure for the prefusion conformation of spike from both endemic and pandemic strains, including HKU1, <sup><a>25 </a></sup> SARS-CoV, <sup><a>26 </a></sup> and MERS-CoV. <sup><a>27 </a></sup> Moreover, S-2P conformational stability translates into greater immunogenicity, <sup><a>27-29 </a></sup> based on preservation of neutralization-sensitive epitopes at the apex of the prefusion molecule, as shown for respiratory syncytial virus F glycoprotein, <sup><a>30 </a></sup> and improved protein expression, <sup><a>27 </a></sup> which is particularly advantageous for gene-based antigen delivery. Thus, presentation of the naturally folded prefusion conformation of the S glycoprotein to the immune system from an mRNA template enables efficient within-host antigen production and promotes both high-quality and high-magnitude antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【56】Previous experience with veterinary coronavirus vaccines and animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have raised safety concerns about the potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. These events were associated either with macrophage-tropic coronaviruses susceptible to antibody-dependent enhancement of replication or with vaccine antigens that induced antibodies with poor neutralizing activity and Th2-biased responses. <sup><a>31 </a></sup> Reducing the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease or antibody-dependent enhancement of replication involves induction of high-quality functional antibody responses and Th1-biased T-cell responses. Studies of mRNA-1273 in mice show that the structurally defined spike antigen induces robust neutralizing activity and that the gene-based delivery promotes Th1-biased responses, including CD8 T cells that protect against virus replication in lung and nose without evidence of immunopathology. <sup><a>32 </a></sup> It is important to note that mRNA-1273 also induces Th1-biased CD4 T-cell responses in humans. Additional testing in animals and ongoing T-cell analysis of clinical specimens will continue to define the safety profile of mRNA-1273.\n\n【57】These safety and immunogenicity findings support advancement of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to later-stage clinical trials. Of the three doses evaluated, the 100-μg dose elicits high neutralization responses and Th1-skewed CD4 T cell responses, coupled with a reactogenicity profile that is more favorable than that of the higher dose. A phase 2 trial of mRNA-1273 in 600 healthy adults, evaluating doses of 50 μg and 100 μg, is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04405076 . opens in new tab ). A large phase 3 efficacy trial, expected to evaluate a 100-μg dose, is anticipated to begin during the summer of 2020.\n\n【58】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【59】Supported by the NIAID , National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, under award numbers UM1AI148373 (Kaiser Washington), UM1AI148576 (Emory University), UM1AI148684 (Emory University), UM1Al148684-01S1 (Vanderbilt University Medical Center), and HHSN272201500002C (Emmes); by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences , NIH, under award number UL1 TR002243 (Vanderbilt University Medical Center); and by the Dolly Parton COVID-19 Research Fund (Vanderbilt University Medical Center).

During the epidemic, some children died of progressive cardiorespiratory failure. Postmortem pathological examinations were performed for 14 patients. Reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assays of various specimens (throat swabs or stool samples) were performed to detect enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A17, and pan-enterovirus messenger RNA. Assays for enterovirus 71 were positive in 12 patients. Assays to detect coxsackievirus A17 were positive in 1 patient, and assays to detect other enteroviruses were positive in 1 patient.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Photomicrographs of Brain-Biopsy Specimens Obtained from Patients with Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease.\n\n【4】Sections of brain-biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A photomicrograph at low magnification (Panel A) shows neuronal necrosis and softening in the brain stem (arrow), and higher magnification (Panel B) reveals the neuronophagia phenomenon (blue arrow) and colloid (black arrow) in the brain stem. A photomicrograph at low magnification (Panel C) shows perivascular cuffing in the brain stem (arrow). A view of the medulla oblongata at low magnification (Panel D) shows hemorrhage (arrow).\n\n【5】The major manifestations of the disease included fever and rash. Neurologic manifestations were noted in all patients. A startle response, myoclonic jerks, and limb trembling were the most frequent early manifestations of neurologic involvement and indicated deterioration due to the illness. As the patients' disease progressed, seizure and coma developed, and death occurred within 1 hour to 5 days after hospitalization. Autopsy of the 14 patients showed that the brain, especially the brain stem, was most severely involved ( Figure 1 ); these findings are consistent with the neurotropism of enteroviruses. <sup><a>1-3</a></sup>\n\n【6】The respiratory symptoms were mild at the beginning of illness. Shortly after the deterioration associated with neurologic involvement, 11 of 14 patients had pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage. All lung specimens showed large amounts of pink fluid in the alveolar space combined with mild lymphocytic inflammation and focal pulmonary hemorrhage without diffuse lung damage (see Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org); these findings are different from those associated with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. <sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【7】Acute heart failure is another severe complication of hand, foot, and mouth disease. In 13 of 14 patients, peripheral hypoperfusion and tachycardia were reported. An elevated level of creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) was detected in 11 patients, and an elevated level of troponin I was detected in 4 patients; this suggests a degree of cardiac damage. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> However, 12 of 14 cardiac specimens showed mild congestion and edema without inflammation, necrosis, or hemorrhage (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix ); these findings indicate that circulatory dysfunction was of neurogenic origin, but it was not caused by myocarditis.\n\n【8】We also analyzed the relationship between the cardiac histologic findings and the serologic markers. In one patient with slightly elevated levels of CK-MB and troponin I, a cardiac specimen showed slight inflammation. In three patients with moderately increased CK-MB levels with elevated levels of troponin I, pathological examination showed neither myocardial inflammation nor necrosis. However, histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen obtained from one patient showed focal necrosis and degeneration of the myocardium, even though the levels of CK-MB and troponin I were normal. Therefore, CK-MB and troponin I may not be predictors of myocarditis related to hand, foot, and mouth disease.\n\n【9】Min Jiang, M.D.  \nDan Wei, M.D.  \nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China\n\n【10】Wei-Lin Ou, M.D.  \nAffiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, Guilin, China\n\n【11】Kun-Xiong Li, M.D.  \nDian-Zhong Luo, M.D., Ph.D.  \nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China\n\n【12】Yun-Qian Li, M.D.  \nAffiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, Guilin, China\n\n【13】E Chen, M.D.  \nYulin Second People's Hospital, Yulin, China\n\n【14】Guang-Min Nong, M.D., Ph.D.  \nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China  \nngm8525@hotmail.  com\n\n【15】Drs.

Wyeth_ that vaccine makers are immune from lawsuits charging that the design of a vaccine is defective. Many physicians and public health organizations applauded this outcome, believing that it will help to ensure the availability and promote the appropriate use of childhood vaccines. Others worry about what it may mean for patients' rights.\n\n【3】The safety of vaccines is a thorny public health issue because vaccines occupy a unique position in the market. When other consumer goods are defective, including defects in their design, their manufacturers are generally strictly liable for resulting harms. Strict liability is strongly favorable for plaintiffs, because the manufacturer is responsible for any damages caused by its products, irrespective of the level of care it exercised. This standard is meant to provide manufacturers with an incentive to develop consumer goods that are appropriately safe. But medical products — including vaccines, drugs, and some medical devices — are unusual in that the same components that make them effective may also cause serious adverse effects. Thus, it may not be possible to design safer versions of them without losing their essential function. Influential legal experts have agreed that manufacturers of these “unavoidably unsafe products” should be exempted from strict liability for these products, as long as consumers are adequately warned about their risks. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> This principle helps to assure that such products remain on the market, since they make a vital contribution to public health.\n\n【4】In the early 1980s, however, the supply of some essential childhood vaccines was threatened by manufacturers who argued that the cost of persistent lawsuits exceeded the income they could earn from these products. In particular, companies were held responsible for alleged vaccine-related injuries even when scientific evidence did not establish causation. Manufacturers claimed that the threat of such liability made it impossible to obtain liability insurance coverage and therefore to maintain operations.\n\n【5】In response, in 1986, Congress enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), establishing a no-fault compensation system (“vaccine court”) for children who were harmed by adverse events following vaccine administration, as long as there was evidence that the vaccine actually caused the problem. The system is expert-driven, and there are no jury trials. Compensation covers the costs of medical expenses, projected lost earnings, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering but does not include punitive damages. It is paid out of taxes levied on each dose of vaccine. Although the NCVIA permits plaintiffs to reject an outcome and file a claim in court, its key preemption provision says that “no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death . . . if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.” <sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Controversy over the proper interpretation of this section of the legislation led to _Bruesewitz v. Wyeth_ . In 1992, 6-month-old Hannah Bruesewitz received a third dose of her diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) vaccine with whole-cell pertussis (Tri-Immunol) and had seizures shortly afterward, followed by a residual seizure disorder and developmental delay. In the vaccine court, the case was denied because the Department of Health and Human Services, concluding that there was no medical evidence of a connection, had recently removed residual seizure disorder from the list of adverse events eligible for administrative compensation. <sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【7】The Bruesewitz family rejected the judgment and sued the manufacturer for failing to develop a safer vaccine. Company documents, identified through discovery in the subsequent civil action, did refer to increased adverse reactions with Tri-Immunol — although not residual seizure disorder specifically — as compared with a vaccine with an acellular pertussis component (DTaP). In other documents, company representatives appeared to conclude that pursuing this “better pertussis component” was “not worth it for the total market.” <sup><a>4 </a></sup> The DTaP vaccine is now standard in the United States, and Wyeth removed Tri-Immunol from the market in 1998.\n\n【8】The case reached the Supreme Court, which held that the NCVIA preempted the Bruesewitzes' lawsuit. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> Writing for the majority in a six-to-two decision, Justice Antonin Scalia concluded that the NCVIA provided no options for plaintiffs who set aside the vaccine court's determination, unless they could argue that the vaccine was poorly manufactured or accompanied by improper warnings. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor rejected this view, writing that the NCVIA's preemption of further litigation was intended to apply only to cases in which the manufacturer can demonstrate that “the side effect stemming from the particular vaccine's design is \\`unavoidable.'”\n\n【9】Their disagreement centers on the question of what Congress intended to do in the NCVIA and highlights the uneasy relationship between preemption and product safety. Federal preemption of product liability lawsuits that rely on state law is a powerful prerogative that places heavy emphasis on the quality of regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Litigation such as the Bruesewitzes' can help the FDA in its oversight function by revealing important and previously unknown information about product-related risks, especially during the postapproval period, and by deterring manufacturers from acting irresponsibly and engaging in business tactics aimed at increasing product sales at the expense of patient safety. These considerations were prominent in _Wyeth v. Levine,_ a 2009 Supreme Court decision that held that federal law did not preempt state-court lawsuits over drug safety.\n\n【10】However, childhood vaccines differ from drugs in many ways. They are given widely to healthy children to prevent potentially deadly infectious diseases. The childhood vaccine market is also apparently less stable than the drug market, since there are fewer vaccine suppliers and there's therefore a real risk of shortages if companies leave the field. In this environment, an administrative forum in which considerable expertise informs determinations about causation can play an essential role by resolving fairly most cases of alleged vaccine-related adverse events. For example, in the autism cases, the vaccine court rightly found no link between vaccination and that condition. But should the existence of the vaccine court necessarily preempt all lawsuits alleging that a vaccine could have been made safer? Civil litigation could be useful in the rare cases in which a plaintiff was contending that a plausible alternative vaccine design would have prevented the adverse event at issue. This argument is particularly relevant because the FDA doesn't usually consider whether a safer product design exists when deciding whether to approve a vaccine or keep a vaccine on the market.\n\n【11】The Court's reasoning in _Bruesewitz_ was based in part on concern about the exploitation of such an exception by plaintiffs' lawyers, who could bring cases based on testimony about a “universe of alternative designs” that is “limited only by an expert's imagination.” Might opening this possibility defeat the purpose of the vaccine court and again potentially jeopardize market stability and vaccine availability? The Supreme Court noted that in place of litigation, the NCVIA “provides many means of improving vaccine design.” <sup><a>5 </a></sup> Among those listed were oversight by the FDA, voluntary reporting and monitoring of adverse events (both of which are known to be imperfect means of detecting risk and ensuring safety), and the National Vaccine Program. Amendments to the NCVIA may be required to provide additional regulatory support, because these systems are now operating without one important safety net.\n\n【12】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Disclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【14】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【15】From the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Harvard Medical School; and the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital — both in Boston.\n\n【16】Supplementary Material\n----------------------\n\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 54KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【18】References _(5)_\n----------------\n\n【19】1.  1\\.

Our knowledge of sexual behavior in this older age group is therefore limited, but a stereotype prevails that elderly persons are asexual. My colleagues and I therefore studied sexual behavior in a representative sample of 321 85-year-olds without dementia who were living in Göteborg, Sweden. The subjects were 223 women (21 married and 202 not married) and 98 men (55 married and 43 not married). The sample has been described in detail previously. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> All subjects were examined by a psychiatrist in a semistructured interview.\n\n【3】Table 1.  Table 1. Frequency of Sexual Intercourse and Sexual Feelings during the Past Year among 85-Year-Olds without Dementia.\n\n【4】Table 1 shows the proportion reporting sexual intercourse and sexual feelings during the previous year. The frequency of sexual intercourse was highly related to marital status, as has been found previously in studies of elderly people. <sup><a>2-4 </a></sup> The difference in the numbers of married men and women is due to the women having married men older than themselves. There was one man for every five women among unmarried subjects, so the number of potential partners for unmarried women in this age group is low. Among married subjects the proportion who reported sexual intercourse was similar to that in two smaller studies with more highly selected groups of subjects. <sup><a>2,4 </a></sup> Of the 13 sexually active 85-year-old men, 5 reported no problems with sexual intercourse whatsoever and 5 reported high levels of coital satisfaction. As in other studies, <sup><a>2 </a></sup> the frequency of sexual feelings was higher than that of sexual intercourse, and it was also higher among married subjects.\n\n【5】These results indicate that a substantial minority of very old people continue to engage in sexual intercourse if they are married. An even larger group continue to have sexual feelings. These findings argue against the view that elderly people are neither able to engage in nor interested in sexual activity. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> Although sexual function may be important to older adults, it is often ignored by health professionals and researchers, despite the fact that successful therapies are available in many cases of sexual dysfunction, even late in life. <sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【6】Ingmar Skoog, M.D.  \nGöteborg University, S-413 45 Göteborg, Sweden\n\n【7】5 References\n\n【8】1.  1\\.

Health care workers collected a swab sample from the patients’ oropharynx or nasopharynx according to testing guidelines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. This procedure potentially increased the risk of transmission of the virus to health care workers who lacked sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE). <sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】In other clinical conditions, <sup><a>2,3 </a></sup> it is faster to obtain a tongue, nasal, or mid-turbinate sample than a nasopharyngeal sample, with less potential for the patient to sneeze, cough, or gag. In addition, recent data support the validity of non-nasopharyngeal samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2. <sup><a>4,5 </a></sup> Collection by the patient reduces high exposure of the health care worker to the virus and preserves limited PPE.\n\n【4】We obtained swab samples from the nasopharynx and from at least one other location in 530 patients with symptoms indicative of upper respiratory infection who were seen in any one of five ambulatory clinics in the Puget Sound region of Washington. Patients were provided with instructions and asked to collect tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples, in that order. A nasopharyngeal sample was then collected from the patient by a health care worker. All samples were submitted to a reference laboratory for reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing that yielded qualitative results (positive or negative) and cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive samples only (additional details are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\n\n【5】Our study was powered on the basis of a one-sided test to determine whether the sensitivities of the non-nasopharyngeal swabs collected by the patients themselves were significantly greater than 90%. We calculated that 48 patients with positive nasopharyngeal samples would be needed for the study, assuming a true sensitivity of 98% with 80% power. Pairwise analyses were conducted to compare each sample collected by the patient with the nasopharyngeal sample collected by a health care worker. Of the 501 patients with both tongue and nasopharyngeal samples, both swabs tested negative in 450 patients, both swabs tested positive in 44, the nasopharyngeal swab was positive and the tongue swab was negative in 5, and the tongue swab was positive and the nasopharyngeal swab was negative in 2. Of the 498 patients with both nasal and nasopharyngeal samples, both swabs were negative in 447, both swabs were positive in 47, the nasopharyngeal swab was positive and the nasal swab was negative in 3, and the nasal swab was positive and the nasopharyngeal swab was negative in 1. Of the 504 patients with both mid-turbinate and nasopharyngeal samples, both swabs were negative in 452, both swabs were positive in 50, and the nasopharyngeal swab was positive and the mid-turbinate swab was negative in 2; none of these patients had a positive mid-turbinate swab and a negative nasopharyngeal swab.\n\n【6】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Cycle Threshold (Ct) Values from Tongue, Nasal, and Mid-Turbinate Swabs Collected by Patients Relative to Those from Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collected by Health Care Workers.\n\n【7】The correlation coefficient is superimposed on each panel, along with a trend line estimated with the use of simple linear regression. Plots show the available Ct values for 43 patients who had positive test results from both tongue and nasopharyngeal swabs (Panel A), 46 patients who had positive test results from both nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs (Panel B), and 48 patients who had positive test results from both mid-turbinate and nasopharyngeal swabs (Panel C). Data on 4 patients (1 patient with positive test results from both tongue and nasopharyngeal swabs, 1 patient with positive test results from both nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, and 2 patients with positive test results from both mid-turbinate and nasopharyngeal swabs) were not included in this analysis because multiple swabs obtained from these patients were labeled with a single test site (i.e., tongue, nasopharynx, nose, or middle turbinate).\n\n【8】When a nasopharyngeal sample collected by a health care worker was used as the comparator, the estimated sensitivities of the tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples collected by the patients were 89.8% (one-sided 97.5% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 78.2 to 100.0), 94.0% (97.5% CI, 83.8 to 100.0), and 96.2% (97.5% CI, 87.0 to 100.0), respectively. Although the estimated sensitivities of the nasal and mid-turbinate samples were greater than 90%, all the confidence intervals for the sensitivity of the samples collected by the patients contained 90%. Despite the lack of statistical significance, both the nasal and mid-turbinate samples may be clinically acceptable on the basis of estimated sensitivities above 90% and the 87% lower bound of the confidence interval for the sensitivity of the mid-turbinate sample being close to 90%. Ct values from the RT-PCR tests showed Pearson correlations between the positive results from the nasopharyngeal swab and the positive results from the tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate swabs of 0.48, 0.78, and 0.86, respectively. Figure 1 shows the Ct values for the sites from the patient-collected swab samples relative to those for the nasopharyngeal swab samples, with a linear regression fit superimposed on the scatterplot. For patients with positive test results from both the nasopharyngeal swab and a tongue, nasal, or mid-turbinate swab, the Ct values for the swabs collected by the patient were less than the Ct values for the nasopharyngeal swab 18.6%, 50.0%, and 83.3% of the time, respectively, indicating that the viral load may be higher in the middle turbinate than in the nasopharynx and equivalent between the nose and the nasopharynx (additional details are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【9】Our study shows the clinical usefulness of tongue, nasal, or mid-turbinate samples collected by patients as compared with nasopharyngeal samples collected by health care workers for the diagnosis of Covid-19. Adoption of techniques for sampling by patients can reduce PPE use and provide a more comfortable patient experience. Our analysis was cross-sectional, performed in a single geographic region, and limited to single comparisons with the results of nasopharyngeal sampling, which is not a perfect standard test. Despite these limitations, we think that patient collection of samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing from sites other than the nasopharynx is a useful approach during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n【10】Yuan-Po Tu, M.D.  \nEverett Clinic, Everett, WA\n\n【11】Rachel Jennings, Ph.D.  \nBrian Hart, Ph.D.  \nUnitedHealth Group, Minnetonka, MN\n\n【12】Gerard A.

Fat-weight loss did not differ significantly between dieters and exercisers. All subjects were discouraged from altering their diet composition; however, dieters and exercisers had slight reductions in the percentage of kilojoules derived from fat.\n\n【3】As compared with the control group, both weight-loss groups had significant increases (P<0.01) in plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (diet vs. exercise, 0.13±0.03 vs. 0.12±0.03 mmol per liter), HDL <sub>2 </sub> cholesterol (0.07±0.02 vs. 0.07±0.02 mmol per liter), and HDL <sub>3 </sub> cholesterol (0.07±0.02 vs. 0.06±0.02 mmol per liter) and significant decreases (P<0.05) in triglyceride levels (diet vs. exercise, -0.35±0.14 vs. -0.24±0.12 mmol per liter).

These findings led to a hospital-wide effort to reduce ancillary services. As part of this effort, we studied the effect of the reductions in respiratory therapy on patient outcome. At the beginning of the study, senior respiratory therapists advised physicians about the optimal use of various respiratory-therapy services, including their discontinuation when no longer necessary.

Moreover, if some variants of concern have increased transmissibility or virulence, the importance of efficient public health measures and vaccination programs will increase. The global response must be both timely and science based.\n\n【3】Introduction\n------------\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Vaccine-Related Priorities to Control Viral Variants.\n\n【5】In addition to continuing to track the emergence of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are four major priorities for the global response to variants of concern ( Table 1 ). These priorities, which involve scientific approaches for evaluating existing vaccines and developing modified and new vaccines, are to determine whether existing vaccines are losing efficacy against variants, to decide whether modified or new vaccines are warranted to restore efficacy against variants, to reduce the likelihood that variants of concern will emerge, and to coordinate international research and the response to new variants, both in general and in relation to vaccines, through the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n【6】Efforts to track viral mutations and variants are ongoing. The aim is to detect new changes quickly and to assess their possible effects. Many research groups are sequencing virus isolates and sharing these sequences on public databases such as GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). <sup><a>1 </a></sup> This collaboration helps scientists track the ways in which the virus is evolving. In order to help monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic, it is important that all countries increase the collection of virus isolates for sequencing and sharing. A SARS-CoV-2 risk-monitoring and evaluation framework is being developed and continually improved by the WHO to identify and assess variants of concern. This framework, which involves enhanced surveillance, research on variants of interest and variants of concern, and evaluation of the effect of variants on diagnostic tests, therapeutic agents, and vaccines, will assist in global decision making regarding changes in vaccines that may be necessary.\n\n【7】Table 2.  Table 2. Key Spike Protein Mutations in Five SARS-CoV-2 Variants.\n\n【8】Variants of concern with increased transmissibility are contributing to the reversal of the decreases in Covid-19 case counts that occurred in many countries earlier this year. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> The B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant of concern increases viral transmissibility <sup><a>3 </a></sup> and is emerging as an increasingly common variant. The P.1 (or gamma) variant may cause severe disease even in persons who have been previously infected, although definitive information is lacking. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> The B.1.351 (or beta) variant is less easily neutralized by convalescent plasma obtained from patients infected with previous variants and by serum obtained from vaccinees than the prototype virus on which vaccine antigens are based, <sup><a>5 </a></sup> and preliminary evidence (based on data from post hoc subgroups in placebo-controlled vaccine trials) suggests reduced efficacy of some vaccines against mild or moderate disease caused by this variant. <sup><a>6-8 </a></sup> Additional variants that are responsible for many deaths, such as B.1.617.2 (or delta), <sup><a>9 </a></sup> continue to emerge. So far, there is no good evidence that currently identified variants of concern evade the most important vaccine effect — that of prevention of severe disease. Table 2 describes key properties of and mutations in five selected variants. The fact that a few key amino acids in the spike protein have changed independently in variants identified in various parts of the world indicates that these are convergent changes and suggests that vaccines that incorporate these selected residues could cover several variants.\n\n【9】Evaluating Existing Vaccines for Efficacy against Variants\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Although animal models and in vitro studies can provide important information, clinical data will continue to be needed to determine whether existing vaccines are losing efficacy against variants. While existing vaccines are being deployed, clinical data can be sought not only from carefully planned observational studies, but also from randomized trials of vaccines versus placebo, of one vaccine versus another, or of different vaccination regimens (e.g., different doses, numbers of doses, and intervals between doses).\n\n【11】In areas where the vaccine supply or delivery capacity is limited, instead of letting operational decisions determine the order in which people are vaccinated, making first vaccine doses available to some of the target population on a randomized basis could provide useful information about efficacy against major variants. This is especially true if the numbers of participants who undergo randomization are large enough to allow assessment of “hard” end points such as hospitalization or severe disease.\n\n【12】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Roles of Researchers, Vaccinees, and Vaccinators in Simplified Randomized Trials Conducted during Vaccine Deployment.\n\n【13】In trials to assess vaccine efficacy, work performed by trial researchers is considerably more simplified than work in a standard trial, with no extra effort required from vaccinees or vaccination personnel. Covid-19 denotes coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n【14】If large-scale randomization were used during vaccine deployment to compare the effects of early second doses with those of delayed second doses, any differences in efficacy could be reliably assessed not only overall but perhaps with respect to certain common variants. In some populations, random assignment of the vaccination date or location might be built into public health programs, and persons who become eligible for vaccination (according to vaccine priority groupings) could be randomly assigned to receive appointments to be vaccinated with a longer or a shorter gap between doses or to receive one vaccine or another. This strategy might allow many hundreds of thousands of persons to undergo randomization with little cost to the vaccination program and with little or no disturbance of the existing vaccination capacity ( Figure 1 ). At the opposite extreme of trial size, if any vaccines were known to have the potential to prevent Covid-19 even when administered after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, relatively small, randomized studies of postexposure prophylaxis could provide important insights about vaccine efficacy (or relative efficacy) against different strains.\n\n【15】Nonrandomized observational studies that attempt to estimate vaccine effectiveness are all prone to some bias. Nevertheless, in areas where several variants are cocirculating and some but not all of the population has been vaccinated, carefully designed observational studies of the distribution of viral genotypes among cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons could yield fairly reliable estimates of relative vaccine efficacy against various variants. Such studies should account for potential confounding if the level of vaccination is correlated with the relative prevalence of variants across sites . Observational studies could also detect loss of protection against variants of concern in previously infected persons.\n\n【16】Observational studies lack precision when either vaccine uptake or variant prevalence is too low or too high for statistical stability, but they could provide insights if cases and controls are adequately matched for potential confounders (e.g., in a “test-negative design” <sup><a>10 </a></sup> ). There are ways to at least limit confounding for such studies in general <sup><a>11 </a></sup> and for test-negative studies in particular. <sup><a>12,13</a></sup>\n\n【17】Creative methodologic approaches are still needed to assess any influences of variants of concern on vaccine efficacy and durability. In studies of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against variants of concern, near-complete sequencing of isolates from selected sentinel sites can reduce biases in the selection of samples for sequencing. Sequencing capacity is lacking in many parts of the world and should be increased. Samples obtained from unselected vaccine recipients with breakthrough infection and from matched unvaccinated controls could be used to assess the influence of particular genomic or antigenic features of interest on vaccine efficacy. With the use of such approaches (i.e., “sieve analyses” <sup><a>14 </a></sup> ) in trials or in studies conducted after vaccine deployment, important insights could be gleaned about the relevance of particular viral features, and these insights may lead to improved strain selection in the formulation of modified vaccines.\n\n【18】How reliably any immune biomarker can serve as a “correlate of protection” is not yet known. The effects of vaccination on such biomarkers (as surrogate end points) — if those biomarkers prove to be reliably predictive of the effects of vaccine on the incidence or outcome of breakthrough infections — could provide support for regulatory action regarding new candidate vaccines. However, caveats include the potential dependence of immune correlates of protection on vaccine-specific factors, viral strain, and the choice of Covid-19 study end points (i.e., any infection vs. symptomatic infection vs. severe disease).\n\n【19】Evaluating New or Modified Vaccines against Variants\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Although there will be reluctance to deploy vaccines that are based on new sequences before there is clear evidence that the original vaccines are failing, there will also be reluctance to allow prolonged circulation of vaccine-resistant variants while new vaccines or modified vaccines are being developed, if this can be avoided. Now is the time to plan for the development of modified vaccines that could protect against vaccine-resistant variants, because such variants may well emerge. Planning should include the effect of vaccine modification on timelines for vaccine supply and rollout.\n\n【21】Studies of modified vaccines (i.e., vaccines in which a new antigen is delivered through a vaccine that has already been shown to be effective against previously circulating viral variants) should address the ability of these vaccines to elicit responses in persons who have not previously had an immunologic response against SARS-CoV-2 and in previously vaccinated persons. Changes in the in vitro neutralization of circulating strains by vaccine-induced antibodies may not imply waning effectiveness. Although neutralizing responses may not be reliably predictive of vaccine efficacy, striking differences may well provide sufficient support for regulatory decisions. For example, the magnitude of the immune response against one or more variants of concern after a person has received a modified vaccine could be compared with that against the prototype virus after a person has received the original vaccine that is known to be effective. Assessment of neutralizing responses against several variants of concern and against the prototype virus may help to determine whether more than one vaccine (or, ultimately, a polyvalent vaccine) is needed.\n\n【22】There has been consensus in recent regulatory discussions <sup><a>15 </a></sup> and in WHO guidance that conventional, large, clinical end-point trials are probably not necessary in order to introduce modified vaccines against variants of concern. Because differences among assays of immune responses may complicate direct comparisons, the Food and Drug Administration (but not the European Medicines Agency) has proposed that animal models <sup><a>16 </a></sup> could be used to provide further support for the effectiveness of modified vaccines against variants of concern.\n\n【23】Even with the deployment of some safe and effective vaccines, more will be needed to address the international pandemic. New vaccines may be more effective than previous vaccines against emerging viral variants, and they may be administered in a single dose, be noninjectable, avoid cold-chain constraints, or have improved manufacturing scalability. The design of modified vaccines or of completely new vaccines should leverage international recommendations regarding antigenic composition.\n\n【24】Table 3.  Table 3. Randomized Trials to Determine the Efficacy of New Vaccines.\n\n【25】Trials of new vaccines can still yield reliable and interpretable results in an efficient manner by using randomization, by evaluating effects not only on immunologic but also on clinical end points, and by using placebo controls when ethically appropriate, <sup><a>17,18 </a></sup> perhaps in communities where vaccine supply is very limited or in subpopulations (e.g., young adults) in which even if infection occurs, the probability of progression to serious disease is very low. <sup><a>19,20 </a></sup> Randomized trials require additional planning, but when practicable they prevent unidentified trial design–related differences from confounding the study results. <sup><a>21 </a></sup> Viral genotyping in persons with breakthrough infection (during or after trials) can support multiple analyses, including assessment of the influence of viral variants on vaccine efficacy. In randomized, controlled studies, such genotyping also yields unbiased information about variant-specific efficacy. Countries that participate in such trials may assess vaccine efficacy against locally prevalent viral strains and should receive priority access to trial vaccines if they have been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and to be efficacious ( Table 3 ). In areas where placebo-controlled trials of new vaccines are not appropriate, the use of an active comparator could still yield important results. <sup><a>22 </a></sup> However, the validity of a noninferiority trial in which an active comparator vaccine is used as the control is dependent on the ability of the previous studies of the active comparator to provide investigators with reliable insights about the efficacy of the active comparator vaccine against viral variants that are currently present in communities engaged in the trial.\n\n【26】Once modified vaccines or completely new vaccines that address new variants have been introduced, the cycle can begin anew with monitoring for even newer variants that might necessitate further changes in the vaccine antigen sequence. Development and deployment strategies should account for the possibility that multiple variants may circulate in the same area. Studies in which one vaccine is boosted with a later dose of another would also be valuable.\n\n【27】Reducing the Risk That Variants of Concern Will Emerge\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Variants of concern have been evolving since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, with selective advantage generally favoring more transmissible variants. Variants of concern with resistance against natural or vaccine-induced immunity would probably supplant previously circulating strains only if this immune evasion capability resulted in increased fitness, including transmissibility. Given the emergence of immunity-evading variants even before vaccines were broadly deployed, it is hard to implicate vaccines or vaccine deployment strategies as the major drivers of immune evasion.\n\n【29】However, prolonged viral replication in the presence of partial immunity in immunocompromised persons or circumstances in which rapid transmission of high titers of virus occurs (e.g., crowded living conditions <sup><a>23 </a></sup> ) could have contributed to the development of variants that can at least partially escape human immune responses. The use of antibody-based treatments (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma) in circumstances in which they are of limited or undemonstrated efficacy may further contribute to the evolution of variants of concern that could evade not only these but also other antibody responses. <sup><a>24 </a></sup> Partially effective interventions may therefore encourage viral evolution. In addition, the larger the number of infected persons, the greater the chance that new variants of concern will arise. Hence, effective public health strategies such as social distancing, the use of masks, and the targeted use of effective vaccines that reduce both infection and transmission can help to limit viral evolution. Limiting transmission in the general population is extremely important for slowing the emergence of additional variants of concern.\n\n【30】Globally, vaccines are being rolled out slowly, partly because of limitations on production capacity and “vaccine nationalism,” <sup><a>25 </a></sup> and in many countries supplies will probably be limited even in late 2021. Currently, the main strategy is to protect critical services, persons in whom severe disease is most likely to develop (e.g., older adults), and persons who are likely to transmit the virus to vulnerable populations (e.g., health care, frontline, and essential workers), and to contain the spread of the virus in the general population. The balance between using vaccines to protect persons from disease and using vaccines to target prevention of spread involves a strategic decision that should be informed by reliable epidemiologic information.\n\n【31】In some epidemics, complete disease elimination has been achieved efficiently by using an epidemiologic understanding of transmission to target the deployment of vaccines (e.g., vaccinating “rings” of contacts and contacts of contacts around cases of smallpox or Ebola <sup><a>26-28 </a></sup> ). Together with other public health measures, targeting vaccination to persons in certain areas or to demographic groups with a high incidence of infection rather than focusing only on persons at high risk for serious disease could slow transmission and reduce the risk of development of additional variants of concern, although no strategy can work if adequate vaccine supplies are unavailable. Targeted approaches are now being investigated. For example, in certain areas, the deployment of some vaccines in a modified ring vaccination strategy has been suggested. <sup><a>29 </a></sup> Studies of the effectiveness of such targeted strategies could be of global relevance, especially if groups or areas with consistently high and low rates of transmission can be identified.\n\n【32】Coordinating the Worldwide Response\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】New variants of concern may emerge in any corner of the world and spread quickly, and convergent changes have been noted in variants of concern identified in various parts of the world. The modification of sequences targeted by a vaccine to meet the needs of one country could have repercussions elsewhere. Therefore, vaccine development, vaccine modification, and vaccine deployment should be viewed as international enterprises, with international coordination by the WHO helping benefits to accrue throughout the world.\n\n【34】Figure 2.  Figure 2. A Framework for Evaluating Vaccines against Variants of Concern.\n\n【35】After variants of concern are designated, the efficacy of existing vaccines is evaluated with the use of in vitro data, animal models, randomized evidence, observational studies, and surveillance.\n\n【36】Coordination is essential in assessing the need for new or modified vaccines, in evaluating them, and in facilitating scientific understanding of the risk posed by novel variants and of the relationships between genetic variation and antigenic escape. Open and frequent scientific discussion is necessary to identify which variants of concern require attention. Criteria are needed to assess the appropriateness of given vaccines and the likely effect of emerging variants on vaccines, as well as to support recommendations on the development and evaluation of modified vaccines and new vaccines and the timing of their deployment. This process can build on the global framework used periodically by the WHO to coordinate the selection of antigens in influenza vaccines ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【37】Decision making about which antigens should be included in vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will need to involve epidemiologic data, data from evolutionary biology, and clinical, animal, and in vitro data that are pertinent to immune responses and to continued vaccine efficacy in the face of changing viral sequences and the possible waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Meeting these challenges efficiently will require enhanced surveillance with continued sharing of data (including viral sequences and corresponding antigens that are linked to clinical and epidemiologic information) and samples (including new viral variant isolates and serum samples obtained from vaccinated persons). It will also require the use of standardized reference reagents and models to evaluate viruses and modified vaccines. With collaborative, open discussion of results, this data sharing will help foster consistent and thoughtful public communications about new variants and help maintain appropriate confidence in vaccines and in the processes used to develop, test, and deploy them.\n\n【38】Although Covid-19 continues to present public health challenges, including the emergence of new variants, great progress has been made in understanding this disease and how to protect against it. Even though existing vaccines are helping to bring the pandemic under control in some locations, it is also necessary to plan for unsatisfactory outcomes. As this planning continues, international coordination by the WHO of research efforts and sharing of data and specimens should be a priority. Maintaining the efficacy of vaccines against emerging variants and achieving equitable access to effective vaccines in all countries will be of utmost importance as a sustainable response is built.\n\n【39】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【40】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【41】The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and not necessarily those of their organizations or of the World Health Organization.\n\n【42】This article was published on June 23, 2021, at NEJM.org.\n\n【43】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【44】From the Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD (P.R.K., M.G.); the Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle (T.R.F.); the Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville (I.M.L.); the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford (R.P., V.B.), and the Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford and National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (M.D.S.), Oxford, and the Global Health Programme, Chatham House (D.L.H.), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (J.P.C.), London — all in the United Kingdom; the Howard College School of Law, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban (J.A.S.), and the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, Johannesburg (H.R.) — both in South Africa; the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto (J.A.S.); the Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel (R.D.B.); the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany (C.M.-F.); the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (K.S.); and the World Health Organization, Geneva (S.B., A.-M.R., R.G., M.D.V.K., S.S., M.J.R., A.-M.H.-R.).\n\n【45】Address reprint requests to Dr. Krause at the Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bldg. 71, Rm. 3234, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993, or at philip.krause@fda.hhs.gov .\n\n【46】Supplementary Material\n----------------------\n\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 440KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【48】References _(29)_\n-----------------\n\n【49】1.  1\\.

Benign and malignant tumors were identified from the pathology records of all Israeli hospitals and from Israeli national cancer and death registries. Doses of radiation to the neural tissue were retrospectively estimated for each patient (mean, 1.5 Gy).\n\n【2】Sixty neural tumors developed in the patients exposed as children, and the 30-year cumulative risk (±SE) was 0.8±0.2 percent. The incidence of tumors was 1.8 per 10,000 persons per year. The estimated relative risk as compared with that for 10,834 matched general-population controls and 5392 siblings who had not been irradiated was 6.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 11.6) for all tumors and 8.4 (confidence interval, 4.8 to 14.8) when the analysis was restricted to neural tumors of the head and neck. Increased risks were apparent for meningiomas (relative risk, 9.5; n = 19), gliomas (relative risk, 2.6; n = 7), nerve-sheath tumors (relative risk, 18.8; n = 25), and other neural tumors (relative risk, 3.4; n = 9). A strong dose–response relation was found, with the relative risk approaching 20 after estimated doses of approximately 2.5 Gy.\n\n【3】Our study confirms that radiation doses on the order of 1 to 2 Gy can significantly increase the risk of neural tumors.

She sits in the same exam room where I’ve seen her for 26 years, first as a patient in my pediatric practice and now as a mother. Philadelphia’s row homes stretch for miles outside the plate-glass window, and I try to imagine each shooting striking one of my friends or relatives or neighbors.\n\n【3】“My faith gets me by, Dr. Novick,” she says, pulling 4-year-old L. onto her lap. “But…you go through each day never knowing who’s next.”\n\n【4】I can still see Ms. T. from the time she was born. I was early in residency — each of us new to our worlds — and overcome with wonder and responsibility. I remember her as a toddler, so proud to become a big sister. And on her fifth birthday, twirling and giggling as her silver tiara slipped over her eyes. And in middle school, saying dance was her escape from the violence on her block. And at 16, sobbing and frantic because her little brother had been shot in the head.\n\n【5】The mother before me has the same natural beauty that she had as a child, but her face is more downcast now, and her movements are noticeably slower.\n\n【6】As a nation, our hearts bleed after every mass shooting. And even as we follow the news in collective shock and grief, gun violence continues to take lives every day — gun violence of a different kind. So far, none of my patients have had to cower under desks while their classmates were slaughtered (although many live in dire fear of that moment). The trauma they face is different. In our city, 33 people were shot during Labor Day weekend, and 10 lost their lives. Many weekends tell a similar tale. For too many families in my care, the shootings are constant and repetitive and woven into the fabric of everyday life.\n\n【7】This is because gun violence here, as throughout the country, is not only a crisis of staggering numbers. It is also a crisis of density. The great majority of violent crime occurs in micro-geographic areas, <sup><a>1,2 </a></sup> often as narrow as a street or block, so that a small fraction of our country’s population bears a devastating amount of the pain.\n\n【8】In two of Philadelphia’s voting wards, for example, areas far smaller than ZIP Codes, nearly 400 people have been shot in the past 2 years. <sup><a>3 </a></sup> The families affected are overwhelmingly Black Americans, since maps of these shootings line up almost exactly with the redlining maps of the 20th century. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> Making specific neighborhoods ineligible for mortgages meant that buildings were left to crumble, green spaces to decay, businesses to shut down or relocate, and schools — which rely heavily on local taxes — to operate without essential resources. Studies have linked each of these factors to gun violence.\n\n【9】My own three children, raised in a revitalized area in between these two wards, have never experienced the death of a peer. But last year, students from one high school in North Philadelphia lost nine schoolmates to gun violence — three in the space of a month. <sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【10】L. wriggles off her mother’s lap and looks at me with a wide, expectant expression that takes my breath away.\n\n【11】“She looks exactly like you when you were this age,” I say to Ms. T.\n\n【12】“I know, they call her my mini-me.”\n\n【13】I ask L. if she needs something, and her eyes open wider. I ask how old she is, and she holds up four fingers. I ask if she goes to school, and she shakes her head no. I wonder if I’ll get her to talk this time.\n\n【14】Ms. T. says school is out of the question “with the way it is out there.” I’m searching for solutions when out comes L.’s voice, asking if we have any crayons. I assure her we do, feeling the warmth of continuity of care — and the concern that inevitably accompanies it.\n\n【15】As a pediatrician working in the same community for more than two decades, I can no longer count the children who’ve told me they lost a friend or parent or sibling to gun violence. I see how my patients are changed. I see the ways shock, loss, and perpetual fear affect childhood health, well-being, and development. I see how the more frequent and severe the trauma, the longer-lasting its impact and the greater its effect on the next generation.\n\n【16】After graduation from high school, Ms. T. found work as a day-care provider, but her anxiety made the job feel untenable. I ask if she’s in therapy, and she says she is. Then she lays out her plan to study early childhood education.\n\n【17】“That’s incredible,” I say, searching for better words. “You’ve been through so much.”\n\n【18】“I have,” she answers, tearing up as she looks me in the eye.\n\n【19】L. stands in front of a chair now, filling white paper with colorful swirls. As she draws, she twists her hips in silent dance moves, and I wonder what music she’s playing in her head. I wonder how to bottle it and protect it from the fear in the air that she breathes.\n\n【20】I have lists of resources at my disposal. Local organizations provide various supports — therapy and mentorship and sports and art — that I know can be grounding counterweights offering hope and promise. But I also know that children who experience substantial adversity do best when we cocoon them in nurturing relationships and protective environments. And protective environments are hard to come by in places where gun violence concentrates.\n\n【21】Ms. T. wears her brother’s picture on a chain around her neck. I recognize the freckles splayed across his cheeks and his coy look as he poses for the photo. How quiet he was. How he would hide behind the exam table and peer out when he thought I wasn’t looking.\n\n【22】Mother and daughter walk away down the hall, toward a world where their own family has fallen and kindergarten feels like a life-and-death decision. I watch them go, understanding that no care I give will ever be enough, as long as the bullets keep flying.\n\n【23】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【24】Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\n\n【25】Identifying details have been changed, and stories combined, to protect the family’s privacy.\n\n【26】This article was published on October 1, 2022, at NEJM.org.\n\n【27】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【28】From the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia.\n\n【29】Supplementary Material\n----------------------\n\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 98KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【31】References _(5)_\n----------------\n\n【32】1.  1\\.

We estimated the effectiveness of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in preventing reinfection with BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants using a test-negative, case–control study design (Section S1). <sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【3】We extracted data regarding SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing, clinical infection, vaccination, and demographic details from the national SARS-CoV-2 databases, which include all results of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and rapid antigen testing conducted at health care facilities in Qatar. Previous infection was defined as a positive test result at least 90 days before a new positive test finding; persons with negative results were used as controls. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> To control for differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in Qatar, we matched cases and controls according to sex, 10-year age group, nationality, number of coexisting medical conditions, calendar week of testing, method of testing, and reason for testing. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> Previous infection was further categorized according to its occurrence in Qatar before the December 19, 2021, initiation of the omicron wave (pre-omicron infections) or after that date (post-omicron infections). <sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【4】In the main analysis, we estimated the effectiveness of previous infection against reinfection with BA.4 or BA.5 using the determination of S-gene target failure (SGTF) on PCR testing between May 7 and July 28, 2022 (Fig. S3). The SGTF designation indicates the deletion of codons 69 and 70 in the S gene, which is common to omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.4, and BA.5. Because the incidence of BA.1 was negligible during the study, as confirmed by sequencing (Section S2), SGTF was used as a proxy marker for BA.4 or BA.5 infection. The incidence of other variants that were characterized by SGTF was negligible during the study. We also estimated effectiveness on the assumption that all diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections between June 8 and July 28, 2022, were BA.4 or BA.5 infections, since these were the dominant subvariants during this period. Details regarding the study population are shown in Figures S3 and S4. The baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table S1. The study population was broadly representative of the population of Qatar (Table S2).\n\n【5】Table 1.  Table 1. Effectiveness of Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Preventing Reinfection with Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 Subvariants.\n\n【6】The effectiveness of pre-omicron infection against symptomatic BA.4 or BA.5 reinfection was 35.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 12.1 to 52.7); the effectiveness against any BA.4 or BA.5 reinfection regardless of the presence of symptoms was 27.7% (95% CI, 19.3 to 35.2) ( Table 1 ). The effectiveness of post-omicron infection against symptomatic BA.4 or BA.5 reinfection was 76.2% (95% CI, 66.4 to 83.1); the effectiveness against any BA.4 or BA.5 reinfection was 78.0% (95% CI, 75.0 to 80.7).\n\n【7】In the analysis of the effectiveness of previous infection in which we assumed that all diagnosed infections were BA.4 or BA.5, we found results that were similar to those of the main analysis. An analysis of effectiveness that was stratified according to the interval since previous infection showed waning protection over time (Section S3 and Table S3). Sensitivity analyses that were performed after adjustment for vaccination status and after matching according to the number of vaccine doses confirmed the results of the main analysis (Tables S3 and S4). Analyses that were categorized according to vaccination status also confirmed the study results but suggested that effectiveness could be slightly higher among vaccinated persons. Limitations of the study design are discussed in Section S1.\n\n【8】Protection from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against BA.4 or BA.5 reinfection was modest when the previous infection had been caused by a pre-omicron variant but strong when it had been caused by a post-omicron subvariant (including BA.1 or BA.2). Protection of a previous infection against reinfection with a BA.4 or BA.5 subvariant was lower than that against reinfection with a BA.1 or BA.2 subvariant <sup><a>3-5 </a></sup> because of more waning of immune protection over time and a greater capacity for immune-system evasion with the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n【9】Heba N.

We compared the effect of an inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, with that of an inhaled β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist, terbutaline, in the long-term treatment of newly detected asthma.\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】We studied 103 patients (29 male and 74 female patients 15 to 64 years old) in whom asthma had appeared within the previous year. The patients were randomly assigned in blinded fashion to two treatment groups: one to receive 600 μg of inhaled budesonide twice a day, and the other to receive 375 μg of inhaled terbutaline twice a day. The study period was two years.\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】After six weeks of treatment, the patients treated with budesonide tolerated inhaled histamine better than the patients treated with terbutaline (a difference of one doubling dose step, P<0.001), and the difference was sustained. Patients' diaries kept during the first three months of the study and during the last month of the first and second years showed budesonide to be more effective than terbutaline in improving peak expiratory flow in the morning (average increase from the pretreatment value, 32.8 liters per minute for budesonide vs. 4.8 liters per minute for terbutaline; P<0.001) and in the evening (P<0.01). Budesonide was also more effective in reducing the symptoms of asthma (P<0.01) and the use of supplemental β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist medication (P<0.01). Ten patients were withdrawn from the terbutaline group because treatment was insufficiently effective, whereas only one dropped out of the budesonide group. The adverse reactions to both treatments were few and mild.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】Antiinflammatory therapy with inhaled budesonide is an effective first-line treatment for patients with newly detected, mild asthma, and it is superior to the use of terbutaline in such patients. (N Engl J Med 1991; 325:388–92.)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】THE main goal of asthma treatment has usually been to maintain normal airway patency with bronchodilators. A prompt improvement in physiologic measures of expiratory flow can be observed after the administration of β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonists. However, asthma is also characterized by inflammatory changes in the airway mucosa. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> Shedding of the airway columnar epithelial cells has been observed even in patients with mild and newly detected asthma. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> The inflammatory response is characterized by the extravasation of fluid from the bronchial circulation, which leads to mucosal edema and the appearance of inflammatory cells. Chronic asthma may lead to persistent airflow limitation, <sup><a>3 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>4 </a></sup> which may be the end result of long-lasting inflammation.\n\n【12】In patients with asthma, airway inflammation seems to be associated with increased bronchial responsiveness. Theophylline or β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonists do not reduce such hyperresponsiveness, <sup><a>5 </a></sup> <sup><a>6 </a></sup> <sup><a>7 </a></sup> whereas inhaled steroids, which have no effect on airway smooth muscle, effectively reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the symptoms of asthma. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> <sup><a>6 </a></sup> <sup><a>7 </a></sup> <sup><a>8 </a></sup> <sup><a>9 </a></sup> <sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【13】Bronchodilators are widely used as first-line treatment, and inhaled steroids are sometimes added if the symptoms of asthma are not adequately controlled. However, since inflammatory changes are present in the airway mucosa even in the early stages of the disease, it seems logical to introduce inhaled steroids as first-line therapy. The aim of this strategy is to suppress inflammation, which will reduce the need for symptomatic medication with bronchodilators.\n\n【14】To investigate whether the treatment of asthma should begin with antiinflammatory or bronchodilating medication, we undertook a two-year clinical trial in patients with newly detected asthma, who were treated with either an inhaled steroid, budesonide, or an inhaled β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist, terbutaline. Each drug was administered as the first and only regular medication. We studied the effect of long-term treatment on lung function, asthma symptoms, and the need for additional therapy for asthma.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Study Design\n------------\n\n【17】The study was performed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. Five centers participated, and the patients entered the trial at staggered intervals over a 12-month period. During a two-week run-in period, the patients' compliance and capacity to take part in the study were assessed. For analysis, the run-in period and the subsequent four-week base-line period were combined for reference and called \"the pretreatment period.\" No change in therapy was allowed during the run-in and base-line periods. Block randomization (in groups of four) into the two treatment groups took place within each center at the end of the pretreatment period. We report here the results observed during the two years after randomization.\n\n【18】Study Protocol\n--------------\n\n【19】The investigational drugs were budesonide and terbutaline, both delivered from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler through a large volume spacer (Nebuhaler, Astra, Södertälje, Sweden). During the pretreatment period, therapy consisted of terbutaline in a dose of 375 μg twice a day from a metered-dose inhaler. During the treatment period, the patients received either the inhaled steroid budesonide in a dose of 600 μg twice a day or the inhaled μ <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist terbutaline in a dose of 375 μg twice a day. The patients were allowed to use terbutaline from a metered-dose inhaler (250 μg per puff) as supplemental medication. If asthma was insufficiently controlled by the regular study medication and supplemental terbutaline after randomization, the responsible physician could prescribe oral theophylline (300 mg twice a day). Patients with severe exacerbations of asthma could receive oral prednisolone for six days in decreasing doses (30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 mg per day).\n\n【20】Patients\n--------\n\n【21】Adult (15 or older) nonsmoking patients (i.e., patients who had not smoked during the preceding six months) with newly detected bronchial asthma (with symptoms present for less than 12 months) were enrolled after they were evaluated by a chest physician. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) had to increase by more than 15 percent after inhalation of a β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist or decrease by more than 15 percent after an exercise-tolerance test. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> had to be at least 80 percent of predicted values after treatment with a β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist. The FEV <sub>1 </sub> had to fall by more than 15 percent after the patient inhaled 10 breaths of histamine nebulized from a solution containing less than 32 mg of histamine per milliliter. Patients with a history of regular treatment or treatment with corticosteroids or cromolyn were excluded.\n\n【22】Of 103 patients enrolled and randomized, 6 were later found not to have fulfilled all the criteria for enrollment. Three patients had been treated with oral prednisolone during the pretreatment period, one had an irreversible pulmonary obstruction, and two had FEV <sub>1 </sub> values during the base-line period that were too low (<80 percent of the predicted value).\n\n【23】Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was approved by the Finnish Medical Board and the local ethics committees.\n\n【24】Recording Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【25】During the pretreatment period and the subsequent 12 weeks, the patients recorded their peak expiratory flow (PEF) before they took their medication in the morning and evening (Mini Wright Peak Flow Meter, Clement Clarke International, London, United Kingdom), their use of supplemental medication and their adverse reactions. They also recorded every day their symptoms of asthma (dyspnea, cough, and sputum production) and their daily activities, assigning a single score of 0 to 10 to each 24-hour period. Values for the same variables were recorded during the first and second four-week evaluation periods (from week 44 to week 48 and from week 92 to week 96) after the start of the treatment. The assessments performed at the clinic at the start of the pretreatment and active-treatment periods and then after 6, 12, 28, 44, 48, 72, 92, and 96 weeks of treatment included spirometry (with a dynamic wedge bellows spirometer; Vitalograph, Vitalograph Ltd., Buckingham, United Kingdom, or Transferscreen II, Jaeger, Würzburg, Germany \\[one center\\]), a test for bronchial responsiveness (see below), and checks of the patients' diaries. The patients were instructed to take the last dose of the study medication in the evening before each appointment and not to use supplemental medication in the six hours before the appointment.\n\n【26】Assessment of Bronchial Responsiveness\n--------------------------------------\n\n【27】Bronchial responsiveness was tested by challenge with solutions of histamine diphosphate in phosphate-buffered saline. The histamine was prepared in six doubling concentrations, or dose steps —i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg per milliliter. The solutions were delivered from nebulizers (DeVilbiss No. 40, Somerset, Pa.) operated at an airflow of 5 liters per minute. The nebulizers were calibrated and had outputs between 0.125 and 0.250 ml per minute. Each patient used the same nebulizer throughout the study or, if it needed to be replaced, another nebulizer with the same output. The challenge test began with 10 tidal breaths of nebulized saline and continued with histamine solutions of successively higher concentrations. FEV <sub>1 </sub> was measured (in liters, at body temperature and pressure during saturation with water vapor) 1.5 minutes after each 10-breath challenge. The best value of at least two measurements with a difference of less than 4 percent was recorded. This value was compared with the value obtained after saline inhalation. Challenge testing was discontinued when the FEV <sub>1 </sub> fell by 15 percent or more. The concentration of histamine that produced a drop of 15 percent in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> was calculated by interpolation and called the \"provocative concentration\" (PC <sub>15 </sub> ). If FEV <sub>1 </sub> dropped less than 15 percent even when the highest concentration of histamine diphosphate (32 mg per milliliter) was used, the PC <sub>15 </sub> was considered to be 64 mg per milliliter.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】For the measurement of the three variables reflecting lung function — FVC, FEV <sub>1 </sub> and PC <sub>15 </sub> — the time of randomization was used as the point of reference. In the analyses, logarithmic values for PC <sub>15 </sub> were used and the result was expressed as dose steps — e.g., step 0 = 1 mg per milliliter, step 1 = 2 mg per milliliter, and so on. The values for the four variables recorded in the diaries — the morning PEF, the evening PEF, the asthma score, and the number of puffs of supplemental β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist — were first reduced to averages for the six-week pretreatment period and four-week periods during treatment (weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 45 to 48, and 93 to 96). The pretreatment average was used as the reference value.\n\n【30】All seven variables were analyzed with respect to change from the pretreatment to the treatment periods and with respect to trend during the two-year treatment period. Analyses for differences between and within groups were performed by t-test with overall averages for the treatment period. Analyses of asthma scores, however, were performed with Wilcoxon tests. Analyses for trends during treatment — e.g., to see whether the average level of efficacy changed over the later follow-up period — were performed by linear regression on the length of treatment after randomization, to compute a slope for each patient, so that a stepwise increase at the start of treatment would not be included in the trend. All tests were two-tailed. P values below 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【31】Analysis of the data on all 103 patients produced results that were similar to those in the 97 patients fulfilling all enrollment criteria. The results in all 103 patients are given below (intention-to-treat analysis).\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Table 1. Table 1.

The mean difference between treatments in the degree of change is significant for both morning and evening values (P<0.001 and P<0.01).Figure 3.  Figure 3. Asthma-Symptom Score and Inhalations of Supplemental Terbutaline (Day-to-Day Mean).\n\n【36】Values were recorded for 12 weeks after randomization and then for the last 4 weeks of the first and second study years. The mean difference between treatments in the degree of change is significant for both the symptom score and the supplemental inhalations (P<0.01).\n\n【37】The range of possible asthma scores was from 0 to 10; for further explanation, see \"Recording Outcomes.\"\n\n【38】The two treatment groups (terbutaline and budesonide) were similar in all variables at the start of treatment ( Table 1 and Fig. 1 , 2 , and 3 ).\n\n【39】Lung Function\n-------------\n\n【40】FVC values did not change significantly over time or differ significantly between groups. FEV <sub>1 </sub> values rose by an average of 0.13 liter in the budesonide group during the treatment period as compared with the pretreatment period (P<0.05), but did not change significantly in the terbutaline group. The increase in FEV <sub>1 </sub> was significantly higher in the budesonide group than in the terbutaline group (P<0.05). The FEV <sub>1 </sub> showed a significant negative trend in the terbutaline group (mean, —0.20 liter per year; median, —0.03; P<0.05), but not in the budesonide group (mean, —0.06 liter per year; median, —0.06). The trends for the two groups did not, however, differ significantly from each other. PC <sub>15 </sub> values in both groups were significantly higher on average during the treatment period than during the pretreatment period, by half a histamine dose step in the terbutaline group (P<0.01) and 1.6 histamine dose steps in the budesonide group (P<0.001) ( Fig. 1 ). The difference between the changes in the two groups was significant (P<0.001). In the budesonide group, the marked decrease in bronchial responsiveness was apparent after six weeks of treatment; although this decrease continued, the trend over the time of treatment was not significant.\n\n【41】Other Variables\n---------------\n\n【42】Values for variables recorded in the patients' diaries, including PEF values, symptoms of asthma, and the use of supplemental terbutaline, are shown in Figures 2 and 3 . In the terbutaline group, there were no statistical differences between pretreatment and treatment values. In the budesonide group, there were significant increases in the morning and evening PEF values (P<0.001 for each comparison) and significant decreases in asthma symptoms (P<0.001) and the use of supplemental terbutaline (P<0.01). The average increase over the pretreatment value in PEF in the morning was 32.8 liters per minute for budesonide and 4.8 liters per minute for terbutaline (P<0.001). As compared with the terbutaline group, the budesonide group had significantly larger changes in all variables (P<0.001 for morning PEF and P<0.01 for the other three variables). There were two significant trends over the treatment period, both in the terbutaline group: in the use of supplemental terbutaline (mean increase per year, 1.3 inhalations per day; median, 0.0; P<0.05), and in the asthma-symptom score (mean increase per year, 0.8; median, 0.2; P<0.05). However, the two groups did not differ significantly in these trends.\n\n【43】Withdrawal and Extra Medication\n-------------------------------\n\n【44】Table 2.  Table 2. Reasons for Exclusion and Withdrawal during the Two Years of Treatment.\\*\n\n【45】The causes and times of withdrawal from the study are shown in Table 2. Ten patients were withdrawn from the terbutaline group because of insufficient efficacy of therapy after an average of eight months of treatment. One patient dropped out of the budesonide group within one week after starting the study medication. Theophylline was added to the treatment of 12 patients in the terbutaline group and 2 patients in the budesonide group. Thirty-six courses of oral prednisolone were given to 17 patients in the terbutaline group, as compared with 22 courses in 13 patients in the budesonide group. One patient in the terbutaline group did not want to continue in the study after 22 months of treatment because she was free of symptoms. Five patients in the budesonide group stopped treatment for the same reason, after an average of 12 months of treatment. The adverse reactions during both treatments were few and transient. One patient was withdrawn from the terbutaline group after one year because of tachycardia and palpitations, and one from the budesonide group after three months because of throat pain.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】The present study shows that the early use of an inhaled steroid, budesonide, in the treatment of newly detected asthma results in greater improvement in objective and subjective variables than does regular treatment with a β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist, terbutaline. The favorable effect of budesonide was evident even during the first 48 hours of treatment, and it lasted through the entire two-year study period. Most of the patients became nearly free of symptoms and did not need additional medication. During the first 12 weeks of treatment the use of a supplemental β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist decreased by 70 percent in the budesonide group, whereas it increased by 21 percent in the terbutaline group.\n\n【48】Bronchodilators do not appreciably influence inflammatory processes in the airways, but they can mask the underlying inflammation by temporarily relieving symptoms. A recent study suggested that regular inhalation of a β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist is associated with deterioration in the control of asthma in the majority of the subjects. <sup><a>13 </a></sup> The present study shows that moderate doses of terbutaline do not increase bronchial responsiveness, which may increase when higher doses of terbutaline and albuterol (salbutamol) are given. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>6 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>14 </a></sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup><a>15 </a></sup> The regular dose of terbutaline used in our study (375 μg twice a day) was chosen to keep the trial double-blind and ensure compliance. A higher dose, at least at the beginning of the treatment, would probably have caused some adverse effects characteristic of the β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonists and thereby revealed the drugs tested. Requiring inhalations four times a day for two years, which would have been pharmacologically optimal in treatment with a β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist, would have seriously affected compliance.\n\n【49】The decrease in bronchial responsiveness during budesonide treatment was paralleled by an increase in PEF values and a reduced need for supplemental medication. The decreased responsiveness was apparent after six weeks of treatment, and the effect remained throughout treatment. The rapid change in bronchial responsiveness was somewhat surprising, since the patients were not especially hyperresponsive at the beginning of the study and had had asthma for only a short time. According to the subjective measurements (the asthma symptom scores), the clinical symptoms of the patients were reduced much more in the budesonide group than in the terbutaline group during the first 12 weeks of treatment. During the two years, more patients were withdrawn from the terbutaline group because of exacerbation of asthma than from the budesonide group, and more additional therapy with theophylline and prednisolone was needed in the terbutaline group.\n\n【50】Long-term studies like this one suffer from problems with patients' compliance with treatment. Patients who become free of symptoms are likely to neglect or forget to take their medication, especially inhaled steroids, which have no immediate effect as compared with the relief offered by an inhaled β <sub>2 </sub> \\-agonist. The importance of using the study medication was stressed every time the patients visited the clinic, but no quantitative method to monitor the use of the study drugs was available.\n\n【51】If the early introduction of inhaled steroids leads to sustained control of airway inflammation, bronchial responsiveness, and the symptoms of asthma, it may improve the overall outcome of the disease and in many cases may allow a long-lasting remission. This could also reduce mortality due to asthma and lower treatment costs.\n\n【52】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【53】From Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland (T.H., K.K., K.R., A.S., B.S.-A.); Kanta-Häme Central Hospital, Hämeenlinna, Finland (M.J.); Pohjois-Karjala Central Hospital, Joensuu, Finland (T.K.); Kiljava Hospital, Kiljava, Finland (S.K., R.T.); Etelä-Saimaa Central Hospital, Tiuruniemi, Finland (K.L.); Astra Draco AB, Lund, Sweden (K.N., T.P., T.S.); Meltola Hospital, Meltola, Finland (O.S.); and University Hospital, Lund, Sweden (L.A.L.).

We also reexamined testicular biopsy specimens, obtained at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, for the presence of germ cells.\n\n【2】Germ-cell damage, indicated by marked elevations in the plasma level of follicle-stimulating hormone (P<0.001 for the comparison with normal children), was evident in both sexes and was confirmed in the boys by the absence of germ cells in the testicular biopsy specimens and by the small size of the testes for pubic-hair stage. Only 44 percent of the pubertal girls had measurable plasma inhibin levels, as compared with more than 93 percent of normal pubertal girls. Although plasma sex-steroid levels were normal, the secretion of luteinizing hormone in response to stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone was elevated in the pubertal children (P<0.01 for the comparison with normal controls) — a finding that suggests compensation for decreased gonadal function. Despite clear evidence of gonadal damage, girls had early menarche at a mean age (±SD) of 11.95±0.91 years, as compared with the Australian standard of 12.98±1.11 years (P<0.01). Thus, in girls, puberty was early despite primary gonadal damage. Thirteen of 23 boys reached puberty at a mean age of 12.36±0.73 years.\n\n【3】We conclude that treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may lead to primary gonadal damage in both sexes, regardless of the age at treatment, but that the secondary characteristics of puberty develop at a normal age or, in girls, relatively early.

It is noteworthy that Tn _4401_ b-1 and Tn _4401_ b-2 share a single nucleotide variant that is not found in more than 60 other Tn _4401_ variants in GenBank.\n\n【7】Six isolates carried Tn _4401_ b-2 on an IncN plasmid: four _K. pneumoniae_ isolates from two ST types (two of each) and two _E. coli_ isolates. Tn _4401_ b-2 showed the potential for both intraspecies and interspecies plasmid transfer: isolate _C_ ( _K. pneumoniae_ ST252) to isolate _D_ ( _K. pneumoniae_ ST1846), and _K. pneumoniae_ (isolates _C_ or _F_ ) to _E. coli_ (isolate _G_ ). Although the only _K. oxytoca_ isolate (isolate _E_ ) could not be linked to other isolates by means of plasmid transfer, isolate _E_ carried Tn _4401_ b-1, suggesting that the transposon moved from an IncN to an IncP, L/M plasmid.\n\n【8】Despite previous reports of multiple _bla_ <sub>KPC </sub> colonizations or infections in a single patient, <sup><a>5 </a></sup> we show the evolution and diversity of KPE within a single patient over several years. The multiple isolates in this patient may have arisen from the spread of the resistance element within the host, from exposure to other KPE-colonized patients (since KPC-3 is the dominant carbapenemase in this hospital), or both. This report illustrates the limitations of conducting investigations of carbapenemase outbreaks with traditional epidemiologic and molecular tools. Genome sequencing is necessary to evaluate the entire mobilome of KPE.\n\n【9】Michael R.

Nonetheless, celiac disease organizations in the United States continue to advise against the consumption of oats because of concern that commercial oat products may be contaminated with wheat, barley, or rye during harvesting, transporting, milling, and processing. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> However, little information is available on the contamination of oat products in the United States. Here I report an assessment of selected brands of oats for gluten contamination.\n\n【3】Twelve containers of rolled or steel-cut oats, representing four different lots of each of three brands, were purchased in Massachusetts between October 2003 and March 2004. The three brands were Quaker (Chicago), selected because it is a popular brand of oatmeal in the United States; Country Choice (Eden Prairie, Minn.), because it is certified to be organic; and McCann's (Odlum Group, Naas, Ireland), because it is processed in an oats-only facility. Containers were sent unopened to an independent laboratory (Food Allergy Research and Resource Program, Lincoln, Nebr.) for analysis. Samples of oats were homogenized and analyzed in duplicate, according to instructions from the manufacturer (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany). The Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recently validated by the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity, was used for the analysis. <sup><a>3 </a></sup> This ELISA uses R5, a monoclonal antibody, that is equally sensitive to the prolamins of wheat, barley, and rye and that is insensitive to the prolamins of corn, rice, and oats. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> Internal controls for this assay include six gliadin standards of known concentration. The limit of gluten detection is 3 ppm. For this assessment, oat samples were considered gluten-free if they contained 20 ppm or less of gluten, in accordance with the current Codex limit for naturally gluten-free foods. <sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Gluten Content of Commercial Oat Products.\n\n【5】The results of the analysis are presented in Table 1 . On the basis of the mean gluten level in the two extractions, 3 of the 12 oat samples contained gluten levels of less than 20 ppm. The other nine samples had gluten levels that ranged from 23 to 1807 ppm. All three brands of oats had gluten levels above 20 ppm in at least two of the four samples tested. Ranges according to brand were as follows: McCann's, below the limit of detection to 725 ppm; Country Choice, below the limit of detection to 210 ppm; and Quaker, 338 to 1807 ppm.\n\n【6】Contamination of commercial oats in the United States with wheat, barley, and rye is a legitimate concern for persons with celiac disease. None of the three brands of oats included in this assessment could be relied on to be gluten-free.\n\n【7】Tricia Thompson, M.S., R.D.  \n348 Summer St., Manchester, MA 01944\n\n【8】5 References\n\n【9】1.  1\\.

We report 25-year findings of a randomized trial initiated in 1971 to determine whether less extensive surgery with or without radiation therapy was as effective as the Halsted radical mastectomy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】A total of 1079 women with clinically negative axillary nodes underwent radical mastectomy, total mastectomy without axillary dissection but with postoperative irradiation, or total mastectomy plus axillary dissection only if their nodes became positive. A total of 586 women with clinically positive axillary nodes either underwent radical mastectomy or underwent total mastectomy without axillary dissection but with postoperative irradiation. Kaplan–Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of outcome were obtained.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with negative nodes or between the two groups of women with positive nodes with respect to disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, distant-disease–free survival, or overall survival. Among women with negative nodes, the hazard ratio for death among those who were treated with total mastectomy and radiation as compared with those who underwent radical mastectomy was 1.08 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.28; P=0.38), and the hazard ratio for death among those who had total mastectomy without radiation as compared with those who underwent radical mastectomy was 1.03 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.23; P=0.72). Among women with positive nodes, the hazard ratio for death among those who underwent total mastectomy and radiation as compared with those who underwent radical mastectomy was 1.06 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.27; P=0.49).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The findings validate earlier results showing no advantage from radical mastectomy. Although differences of a few percentage points cannot be excluded, the findings fail to show a significant survival advantage from removing occult positive nodes at the time of initial surgery or from radiation therapy.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The Halsted radical mastectomy, an en bloc removal of the breast, muscles of the chest wall, and contents of the axilla, was the “established and standardized operation for cancer of the breast in all stages, early or late” <sup><a>1 </a></sup> for most of the 20th century. However, by the mid-1960s, dissatisfaction with results after radical mastectomy and anecdotal information regarding other procedures led some surgeons to advocate more extensive surgery and others to promote more limited operations. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> New information about tumor metastases also suggested that less radical surgery might be just as effective as the more extensive operations that were being performed. <sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【12】To help resolve the clinical controversy, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) initiated the B-04 clinical trial in August 1971 (participants in the original NSABP study are listed in the Appendix). The aims of the study were to determine whether patients with either clinically negative or clinically positive axillary nodes who received local or regional treatments other than radical mastectomy would have outcomes similar to those achieved with radical mastectomy. Previous findings from this trial demonstrated differences in control of local disease but failed to show a significant difference in either survival free of distant disease or overall survival among the groups of women with negative nodes or between the groups of women with positive nodes. <sup><a>4-7 </a></sup> The 25-year findings reported here support the earlier results.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Clinical Trial\n--------------\n\n【15】Between July 1971 and September 1974, after providing written informed consent, 1765 women with primary operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to treatment. One third of those with clinically negative axillary nodes underwent Halsted radical mastectomy and axillary dissection, one third underwent total mastectomy without axillary dissection but with regional irradiation, and one third underwent total mastectomy alone. One half of the women with clinically positive nodes underwent radical mastectomy; the other half underwent total mastectomy and regional irradiation. Women with clinically negative nodes who had had total mastectomy with neither axillary dissection nor irradiation and who subsequently had pathologically positive axillary nodes in the absence of other manifestations of disease then underwent axillary dissection. None of the women received adjuvant systemic therapy. About 70 percent of the women in each group were 50 years of age or older at the time of entry. On pathological examination, the mean (±SD) diameter of the largest tumor was 3.3±2.0 cm in women with negative nodes and 3.7±2.0 cm in women with positive nodes.\n\n【16】Radiation therapy was administered with supervoltage equipment. Women with negative nodes received 5000 rad (50 Gy; rad was the unit of absorbed dose formerly used) in 25 fractions; node-positive women received an additional boost of 10 to 20 Gy. A dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered to both the internal mammary nodes and the supraclavicular nodes. Tangential fields were used to treat the chest wall with 50 Gy in 25 treatments. An independent radiotherapy monitoring committee and radiologic-physics center conducted oversight of radiation quality. Compliance with radiation therapy and its relation to treatment outcome have been reported previously. <sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【17】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【18】End points for the comparisons among treatment groups were disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, distant-disease–free survival, and overall survival. Times to those end points were calculated from the date of mastectomy. Tumor recurrences in the chest wall, the surgical scar, or both were classified as local recurrences. Recurrences in supraclavicular, subclavicular, or internal mammary nodes or in the ipsilateral axilla of patients treated with either radical mastectomy or total mastectomy and regional irradiation were considered regional recurrences. Women with negative nodes who had total mastectomy alone and who subsequently had ipsilateral positive nodes that required axillary dissection were not considered to have had a recurrence unless the nodes could not be removed, a problem that occurred in one patient. Events considered in the determination of disease-free survival were the first local, regional, or distant recurrence of tumor; contralateral breast cancer or a second primary tumor other than a tumor in the breast; and death of a woman who had no evidence of cancer. Events considered in the estimation of relapse-free survival were the first local, regional, or distant recurrence or an event in the contralateral breast that was judged to be a recurrence. Distant recurrences that occurred either as the first recurrence or after a local or regional recurrence, contralateral breast cancers, and other second primary cancers were considered in the estimation of distant-disease–free survival. All deaths were included in the calculation of overall survival.\n\n【19】The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate curves for disease-free survival, distant-disease–free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival for each treatment group. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> Estimates are provided with their standard errors. Comparisons of the treatments were made with the use of log-rank tests of the available data for all observation times. <sup><a>10 </a></sup> Cox proportional-hazards models were fit in order to estimate hazard ratios. <sup><a>11 </a></sup> The nonparametric method <sup><a>12 </a></sup> was used to estimate the cumulative incidence curves for local, regional, and distant recurrences as first events, and Gray's K-sample test statistic <sup><a>13 </a></sup> was used to test the statistical significance of differences in cumulative incidence among the treatments. We estimated the cumulative incidence of death after a recurrence or a diagnosis of contralateral disease and the cumulative incidence of death without a recurrence or a diagnosis of contralateral disease.\n\n【20】All reported P values are two-sided. P values of 0.05 or lower are considered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses are based on all follow-up information received at the NSABP Biostatistical Center as of March 31, 2001. Eighty-seven percent of all analyzed patients were either followed for at least 25 years or were known to have died before that time. The treatment groups are well balanced in terms of the percentage of patients with follow-up of less than 25 years.\n\n【21】Results\n-------\n\n【22】Disease-free Survival and Relapse-free Survival\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Disease-free Survival (Panel A) and Relapse-free Survival (Panel B) during 25 Years of Follow-up after Surgery among Women with Clinically Negative Axillary Nodes and Women with Clinically Positive Axillary Nodes.\n\n【24】There were no significant differences among the groups of women with negative nodes or between the groups of women with positive nodes in either analysis.\n\n【25】No significant difference in disease-free survival was observed among the groups of women with negative nodes (P=0.65) ( Figure 1A ). At 25 years, the estimated disease-free survival (±SE) was 19±2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group, 13±2 percent among women treated with total mastectomy and radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.25; P=0.49), and 19±2 percent among those treated with total mastectomy alone (hazard ratio for the comparison with the radical-mastectomy group, 1.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.27; P=0.39). Similarly, in the groups that underwent total mastectomy, there was no significant difference between women who received radiation therapy and those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.21; P=0.78). Among women with positive nodes, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between the groups; disease-free survival was 11±2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group and 10±2 percent in the group treated with total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.33; P=0.20).\n\n【26】No significant difference in relapse-free survival was observed among the three groups of women with negative nodes (P=0.46) ( Figure 1B ). The estimated relapse-free survival among such women was 53±3 percent in the radical-mastectomy group, 52±4 percent among women treated with total mastectomy and radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.21; P=0.74), and 50±3 percent among women who had a total mastectomy (hazard ratio for the comparison with the radical-mastectomy group, 1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.42; P=0.27). There was also no significant difference between the groups treated with total mastectomy (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.48; P=0.15). Among women with positive nodes, the estimated relapse-free survival was 36±3 percent among those treated with radical mastectomy and 33±3 percent among those treated with total mastectomy and radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.35; P=0.40).\n\n【27】Distribution and Time to Occurrence of First Events\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Table 1.  Table 1. Distribution of All First Events According to Treatment Group.\n\n【29】Only 20 percent of women with negative nodes and 13 percent of women with positive nodes were alive and event-free after 25 years of follow-up ( Table 1 ). Regardless of nodal status, most first events were related to distant recurrences of tumor and to deaths that were unrelated to breast cancer. The detection of cancer at other sites was relatively infrequent. The frequency of events varied little either among the groups with negative nodes or between those with positive nodes.\n\n【30】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Incidence of Local or Regional Recurrence and Distant Recurrence during 25 Years of Follow-up after Surgery among Women with Clinically Negative Axillary Nodes (Panel A) and Women with Clinically Positive Axillary Nodes (Panel B), According to Treatment Group.\n\n【31】In Panel A, the P values are for the three-way comparisons among treatment groups.\n\n【32】The cumulative incidence of local or regional recurrence varied among the groups of women with negative nodes (P=0.002 for the three-way comparison) ( Figure 2A ) and was lowest in the group treated with total mastectomy and radiation therapy. The benefit from radiation therapy was related to a significant reduction in local recurrence. There were no significant differences among the three groups in the cumulative incidence of distant recurrence as a first event (P=0.61) ( Figure 2A ). Among women with positive nodes, there was no significant difference between the groups in the cumulative incidence of local or regional recurrence (P=0.67) ( Figure 2B ). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of local recurrence after radiation therapy, but not in the incidence of regional recurrence or the incidence of distant recurrence (P=0.44) ( Figure 2B ).\n\n【33】Table 2.  Table 2. Distribution of First Breast-Cancer–Related Events According to Treatment and Time of Occurrence.\n\n【34】In the 1079 women with clinically negative nodes, 68.3 percent of all breast-cancer–related events occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up, and 14.6 percent occurred after 10 years of follow-up ( Table 2 ). Of the events that occurred within the first five years, 65.1 percent were distant recurrences and 10.3 percent were contralateral breast cancer. After 10 years, there were relatively few breast-cancer–related events. Among the 586 women with clinically positive nodes, 81.7 percent of breast-cancer–related events occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up and 5.0 percent occurred after 10 years of follow-up ( Table 2 ). Two thirds (68.1 percent) of all breast-cancer–related events that occurred in women with positive nodes within the first five years were distant recurrences.\n\n【35】Distant-Disease–free Survival and Overall Survival\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Survival Free of Distant Disease (Panel A) and Overall Survival (Panel B) during 25 Years of Follow-up after Surgery among Women with Clinically Negative Axillary Nodes and Women with Clinically Positive Axillary Nodes.\n\n【37】There were no significant differences among the groups of women with negative nodes or between the groups of women with positive nodes in either analysis.\n\n【38】There was no significant difference in distant-disease–free survival among the groups of women with negative nodes (P=0.63 for the three-way comparison) ( Figure 3A ). At 25 years, the probability (±SE) was 46±3 percent among women who underwent radical mastectomy, 38±3 percent among women treated with total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.34; P=0.44), and 43±3 percent among those who underwent total mastectomy alone (hazard ratio for the comparison with the radical-mastectomy group, 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.35; P=0.39). There was also no significant difference between the groups treated with total mastectomy (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.25; P=0.85). Among the women with positive nodes, there was no significant difference in distant-disease–free survival between women who underwent radical mastectomy and those treated with total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (32±3 percent and 29±3 percent, respectively \\[hazard ratio, 1.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.32; P=0.51\\]).\n\n【39】There was no significant difference in overall survival among the groups of women with negative nodes (P=0.68 for the three-way comparison) ( Figure 3B ). At 25 years, overall survival was 25±3 percent among women treated with radical mastectomy (259 deaths), 19±2 percent among those treated with total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (274 deaths) (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.28; P=0.38), and 26±3 percent among those treated with total mastectomy alone (259 deaths) (hazard ratio for the comparison with the radical-mastectomy group, 1.03; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.23; P=0.72). Survival in the group that underwent total mastectomy was not significantly different from that among women treated with total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.13; P=0.60). In women with positive nodes, overall survival in the radical mastectomy group was 14±2 percent (244 deaths); overall survival was also 14±2 percent among women who received total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (247 deaths) (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.27; P=0.49).\n\n【40】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Cumulative Incidence of Death, of Death Following Recurrence or Contralateral of Breast Cancer, and of Death without Recurrence or Contralateral of Breast Cancer among All Women (Panel A), Women with Clinically Negative Axillary Nodes (Panel B), and Women with Clinically Positive Axillary Nodes (Panel C).\n\n【41】The cumulative incidence of death among the 1665 eligible patients was 80 percent during the 25 years of follow-up; 49 percent died after a recurrence or contralateral breast cancer, 31 percent died without a diagnosis of any breast-cancer–related event, and 20 percent were alive at last follow-up ( Figure 4A ). When analyzed according to the nodal status of patients, the cumulative incidence of death after a recurrence or a diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer was 40 percent in women with negative nodes and 67 percent in women with positive nodes. A total of 36 percent of women with negative nodes and 22 percent of those with positive nodes died without such an event, and 24 percent and 11 percent of the two groups, respectively, were alive at last follow-up ( Figure 4B and Figure 4C ).\n\n【42】There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of death unrelated to breast cancer between all women who were treated with radical mastectomy and all those who had a total mastectomy followed by radiation therapy, regardless of nodal status (P=0.79). Similarly, when these treatments were analyzed within groups defined according to nodal status, there were no significant differences in the cumulative incidence of death unrelated to breast cancer (P=0.96 for the comparison between women with negative nodes and P=0.72 for the comparison between women with positive nodes).\n\n【43】Positive Axillary Nodes after Total Mastectomy without Radiation Therapy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】A total of 68 of the 365 women with negative nodes who underwent total mastectomy without radiation therapy (18.6 percent) subsequently had pathological confirmation of positive ipsilateral nodes. Involved nodes were identified within 2 years after surgery in 51 of the 68 women, more than 2 years but within 5 years after surgery in 10 women, more than 5 years but within 10 years after surgery in 6 women, and more than 10 years but within 25 years after surgery in 1 woman. The median time from mastectomy to the identification of positive axillary nodes was 14.8 months (range, 3.0 to 134.5).\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】An important finding of our study is that about 40 percent of the women with clinically negative nodes who were treated with radical mastectomy had pathological confirmation of tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes. <sup><a>14 </a></sup> Because the women in our study were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, we estimate that about 40 percent of those who underwent total mastectomy alone had positive nodes that were not removed at the time of initial surgery. Only about half of these women subsequently received a diagnosis of positive axillary nodes as a first event. Some investigators have suggested that we have underestimated the frequency of the delayed occurrence of positive axillary nodes because, they contend, patients with nodes that became positive after a distant recurrence should also have been included. <sup><a>15 </a></sup> They believe that axillary dissection in all women with clinically negative axillary nodes is justified. Their thesis may have merit in terms of achieving local control of disease; however, our data indicate that leaving positive nodes unremoved did not significantly increase the rate of distant recurrence or breast-cancer–related mortality.\n\n【47】Our findings have also been questioned <sup><a>15-18 </a></sup> because lymph nodes were sometimes found in specimens removed during operations designated as total mastectomy alone. This criticism ignores the fact that there was a profound difference in surgical management of the axilla between women treated with radical mastectomy and those who underwent total mastectomy alone. <sup><a>14 </a></sup> However, no nodes were found in 65 percent of specimens obtained during total mastectomy, and 23 percent contained only one to five nodes. In the radical-mastectomy group, by contrast, only about 2 percent of resected specimens contained 1 to 5 nodes; the median number of nodes was 16.\n\n【48】After 25 years of follow-up, we found no survival advantage from radiation therapy after total mastectomy in women with clinically negative nodes. These results are in accord with those of other investigators: after 10 years of follow-up, they found no significant difference in the survival of patients who, after simple mastectomy without dissection of the axillary nodes, received either regional irradiation or no irradiation. <sup><a>19,20 </a></sup> Our findings differ, however, from those of three studies that reported a decrease in overall mortality of about 10 percent. <sup><a>21-23 </a></sup> The use of various systemic therapies in conjunction with postoperative radiation therapy may have relevance to these variable survival outcomes. Another reason for the differences may relate to the fact that the incidence of local recurrence in nonirradiated women in control groups differed among the studies, suggesting that base-line characteristics of the patients and the tumors might have varied among studies, rendering it difficult to make comparisons between studies. For example, about 40 percent of the women in the group with clinically negative nodes in our study had pathologically positive nodes, whereas in the three studies showing a decrease in mortality, about 90 percent of women had pathologically positive nodes.\n\n【49】In some respects, the findings of a meta-analysis conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) <sup><a>24 </a></sup> are similar to ours. That group noted an overall survival benefit of 1.2 percent among women who received postoperative radiation therapy. With regard to cause-specific mortality, the meta-analysis further noted a significant reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer at 20 years that was partially offset by a significant increase in deaths unrelated to breast cancer. If it were possible to eliminate the long-term hazard associated with radiation therapy, the results reported by the EBCTCG would suggest an absolute increase in 20-year survival of about 2 to 4 percent. In the B-04 trial, differences between the rate of death without recurrence and the rate of death after recurrence did not differ statistically among study groups. Because our study population was smaller than that considered in the meta-analysis, it is unlikely that we would have detected a small advantage from radiation therapy in the rate of deaths from breast cancer or a small disadvantage from radiation therapy in the rate of deaths unrelated to breast cancer on the order of those estimated in the meta-analysis.\n\n【50】When the B-04 trial began, it was popularly believed that five years could be viewed as a milestone and that women who lived for five years free of disease were likely to have been “cured.” However, our findings demonstrate that a substantial proportion of events occurred after five years among both women with negative nodes and those with positive nodes. Twenty-five percent of all first distant recurrences and 50 percent of all contralateral breast cancers were detected after five years, which indicates the need for long-term follow-up, particularly in the evaluation of patients with a good prognosis.\n\n【51】Finally, our findings indicate the need to differentiate between deaths that were related to breast cancer and those that resulted from other causes. In women with negative nodes who were followed for more than five years, the estimate of overall mortality became less indicative of mortality related to breast cancer, because the incidence of death unrelated to breast cancer increased at a faster rate than did the incidence of death related to breast cancer. After 25 years of follow-up, the observation that 31 percent of patients died without a recurrence of breast cancer indicates the need for accurate information about the cause of death in women with long-term follow-up.\n\n【52】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【53】Supported by Public Health Service grants (U10-CA-12027, U10-CA-69651, U10-CA-37377, and U10-CA-69974) from the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n【54】We are indebted to the following persons, who were involved in the study at its inception in 1971: the biostatistician Carol Redmond, Sc.D., and her associates, who were responsible for all biostatistical aspects of the study until 1994; the surgeon George E.

We identified a _Pst_ I restriction-endonuclease site flanking the human apolipoprotein A-I gene at its 3′ end that is polymorphic. The absence and presence of this site, as determined by genomic blotting analysis of _Pst_ I-digested chromosomal DNA with the use of an apolipoprotein A-I gene probe, were associated with 3.3-kb and 2.2-kb hybridization bands, respectively. The 3.3-kb band appeared in 4.1 percent of 123 randomly selected control subjects and in 3.3 percent of 30 subjects with no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. In contrast, among 88 patients who had severe coronary disease before the age of 60, as documented by angiography, the 3.3-kb band occurred in 32 percent (P<0.0001). It was also found in 8 of 12 index cases (P<0.0001) of kindreds with familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia. In the two patient groups, the allele frequencies of the site that produced the 3.3-kb band were 17 and 42 percent, respectively, as compared with an allele frequency of only 2 percent in the control populations. Within kindreds with familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia and among first-degree relatives of patients with coronary artery disease, the 3.3-kb band was associated with decreased HDL cholesterol levels. Among all patients with coronary artery disease, 58 percent had HDL cholesterol levels below the 10th percentile of normal values; however, this frequency increased to 73 percent when patients with the 3.3-kb band were considered. These findings indicate that the polymorphism in the region between the apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein C-III genes may be a useful marker for the risk of premature coronary artery disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia.

Blood cultures grew _Nocardia asteroides_ . The patient had no skin lesions or new focal neurologic signs. A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed multiple new bilateral nodules. The patient refused bronchoscopy. Sputum cultures were negative for fungus. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain showed extensive, bilateral small-vessel disease without acute infarction. She was started on a regimen of 20 mg of trimethoprim per kilogram of body weight per day and 100 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram per day, given intravenously in two doses, and 2 g of ceftriaxone given twice daily.\n\n【3】The fever abated, and four days later, the patient began to have progressively worsening involuntary movements involving the head and all extremities. Neurologic examination revealed diffuse, multifocal myoclonus and bilateral asterixis, with no other abnormalities. The serum levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyroid hormones, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , and folate were normal. The patient refused lumbar puncture. Repeated MRI examination of the brain revealed no new changes. The trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and the involuntary movements decreased markedly the following day; by the fourth day, they had resolved completely. The patient remained afebrile, and her condition continued to improve with the use of intravenous ceftriaxone.\n\n【4】The occurrence of multifocal myoclonus and asterixis induced by treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is very rare. Previous reports have described reversible tremors in patients with AIDS who were being treated with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia. <sup><a>1-3 </a></sup> Only one report has described tremors induced by trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in an immunocompetent patient. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> In these patients, tremors occurred within 3 to 8 days after the initiation of treatment and resolved within 10 days after its discontinuation. This rare complication is dose-related and is not immunologic. The specific mechanism by which trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole induces tremors is not fully understood; dihydrofolate reductase inhibition may affect dopamine metabolism in the central nervous system. <sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【5】Our patient was immunocompromised as a result of recent chemotherapy and was receiving a high dose of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Our findings emphasize that clinicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of myoclonus and asterixis, as well as tremors, in patients who are receiving a high dose of this drug combination. This rare effect might be underdiagnosed, and a trial of discontinuation of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole should be considered before a costly neurologic evaluation is performed.\n\n【6】Elie G.

In our trial, we focused only on symptomatic or fatal events. <sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【15】The Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban versus Placebo in Reducing Post-Discharge Venous Thrombo-Embolism Risk (MARINER) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial. The rationale and design of the trial have been reported previously. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> An executive committee in collaboration with the sponsor (Janssen Research and Development) was responsible for the trial design, protocol, and oversight and served as the writing committee. The institutional review board or ethics committee at each of the 671 participating centers approved the protocol.\n\n【16】Coordination of study committees and support for trial execution were provided by an academic research organization (CPC Clinical Research), Worldwide Clinical Trials, and the academic leadership of the Antithrombotic Trials Leadership and Steering (ATLAS) Group. The data were collected by a contract research organization (Parexel) that was paid by the sponsor. An independent data and safety monitoring committee periodically reviewed trial outcomes and adverse events. The sponsor performed the statistical analysis in collaboration with the executive committee. The members of this committee, which included the authors, wrote all drafts of the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】Patients were eligible for participation in the trial if they were 40 years of age or older and had been hospitalized for at least 3 and not more than 10 consecutive days with one of the following conditions: heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or less, acute respiratory insufficiency or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute ischemic stroke, or acute infectious or inflammatory disease, including rheumatic diseases. Eligible patients also had to have additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism, as indicated by a total modified International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE) risk score of 4 or higher (scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of venous thromboembolism; minimal clinically important difference, 2) or a risk score of 2 or 3 plus a plasma d \\-dimer level of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range, with d \\-dimer measured locally and the normal range defined according to local laboratory criteria. Eligible patients must also have received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin during the index hospitalization.\n\n【19】Patients were excluded if they had a condition that was being treated with anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therapy or if they had active cancer, a history of recent bleeding (within 3 months) or a high risk of bleeding, or other contraindications to rivaroxaban. The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria and the criteria for the modified IMPROVE risk score <sup><a>2 </a></sup> are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【20】Trial Regimen and Follow-up\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rivaroxaban or placebo. Randomization was performed on the day of discharge from the hospital or the next day, with the use of an interactive Web-based system, with stratification according to country and creatinine clearance (≥30 and <50 ml per minute or ≥50 ml per minute). Randomization was balanced in permuted blocks of four. Patients were counseled about and instructed to promptly report symptoms or signs associated with deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding.\n\n【22】The rivaroxaban regimen was 10 mg once daily for patients with a creatinine clearance of at least 50 ml per minute or 7.5 mg once daily for patients with a creatinine clearance of at least 30 but less than 50 ml per minute. The first dose of rivaroxaban or placebo was given as soon as possible after randomization and not later than the next day. The trial agent was taken with or without food for 45 days. This duration was chosen because previous studies had shown that approximately 75% of post–hospital discharge venous thromboembolic events occur by 45 days after discharge. <sup><a>2,7</a></sup>\n\n【23】All the patients were contacted at approximately 7 days (range, 5 to 12), 21 days (range, 18 to 28), and 45 days (range, 45 to 49) after randomization, regardless of whether they continued to take rivaroxaban or placebo. At each contact, a review for suspected outcome events and assessment of symptoms, consisting of scripted questions (see the Supplementary Appendix ), was completed. Counseling about the symptoms and signs of deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding was repeated, and data on adverse events and concomitant medications were collected. All the patients were contacted for safety follow-up on approximately day 75 (range, 70 to 80).\n\n【24】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【25】The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any symptomatic venous thromboembolism (i.e., deep-vein thrombosis in the legs or nonfatal pulmonary embolism) or death related to venous thromboembolism (i.e., death due to pulmonary embolism or death in which pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out as the cause). The prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes were the two components of the primary outcome — symptomatic nonfatal venous thromboembolism and death related to venous thromboembolism — analyzed separately; the composite of nonfatal symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death from any cause; the composite of nonfatal symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or cardiovascular death (death due to a known cardiovascular cause or death in which a cardiovascular cause, including pulmonary embolism, could not be ruled out); and death from any cause.\n\n【26】The principal safety outcome was major bleeding. Other safety outcomes were nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding, other bleeding, and adverse events.\n\n【27】Major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g per deciliter or more, bleeding that led to transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red cells or whole blood, bleeding that occurred in a critical site (i.e., intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intraarticular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal), or fatal bleeding. <sup><a>13 </a></sup> Nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding was defined as overt bleeding that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding but was associated with medical intervention, unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, temporary cessation of the trial regimen, or pain or impairment of activities of daily life. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> Other bleeding was defined as any other overt bleeding that did not meet the criteria for major or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding.\n\n【28】A clinical events committee, the members of which were unaware of the trial-group assignments, adjudicated all suspected episodes of venous thromboembolism, bleeding, myocardial infarction, and stroke and all deaths, with the use of prespecified criteria. Death was adjudicated as being caused by pulmonary embolism, bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or other causes. Pulmonary embolism was considered the cause of death if there was objective documentation that pulmonary embolism caused the death or if the death could not be attributed to another documented cause and pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out. The criteria for the adjudication of the outcomes are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The trial hypothesis was that rivaroxaban would be superior to placebo for the prevention of the primary efficacy outcome. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> The sample size was event-driven, with a targeted total number of events of the primary efficacy outcome of 161, which was determined under an assumption of a 40% lower relative risk with rivaroxaban than with placebo, a power of 90%, and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. We estimated that a total of approximately 8000 patients would be needed in order to observe 161 events, on the basis of an estimated incidence of 2.5% in the placebo group. We prespecified that randomization could be stopped at approximately 9000 patients for administrative reasons even if the targeted 161 events had not been observed. Because the blinded incidence of pooled events was lower than we had estimated, the protocol was amended to increase the maximum number of patients enrolled to 12,000. For patients with multiple events, only the first was counted toward the determination of the size of the trial population. One prespecified interim analysis was performed to evaluate futility. Thus, an adjustment of the final significance level was not done.\n\n【31】All the efficacy analyses were performed with the intention-to-treat population and included all data and outcomes from randomization through day 45. The primary efficacy outcome was analyzed on the basis of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism–related death. The trial hypothesis was tested with a Cox proportional-hazards model, stratified according to creatinine clearance (≥30 and <50 ml per minute or ≥50 ml per minute), with the randomly assigned regimen as the only covariate. Time-to-event curves were calculated with the Kaplan–Meier method.\n\n【32】If superiority of rivaroxaban for the prevention of the primary outcome was established, the secondary outcomes were to be tested sequentially with the use of the same Cox proportional-hazards model, in the following hierarchical order, each at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided): venous thromboembolism–related death; symptomatic venous thromboembolism; the composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death from any cause; the composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or cardiovascular death; and death from any cause.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Patients and Trial Regimen\n--------------------------\n\n【35】Figure 1. Figure 1. Randomization and Follow-up. Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【36】From June 2014 through January 2018, a total of 12,024 patients underwent randomization at 671 centers in 36 countries. The flow of the patients through the trial is shown in Figure 1 . The baseline characteristics of the patients were similar in the two trial groups ( Table 1 ). Permanent discontinuation of rivaroxaban or placebo before 45 days occurred in 8.9% of patients ( Figure 1 ). Temporary interruption of the regimen occurred in 176 patients (2.9%) assigned to rivaroxaban and in 183 patients (3.1%) assigned to placebo. Further details of treatment interruption and adherence are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【37】Efficacy Outcomes\n-----------------\n\n【38】Table 2. Table 2.

In each panel, the inset shows the same data on an expanded y axis.\n\n【40】The primary efficacy outcome of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism occurred in 50 (0.83%) of 6007 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 66 (1.10%) of 6012 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.52 to 1.09; P=0.14) ( Table 2 ). The difference in risk (rivaroxaban minus placebo) was −0.27 percentage points (95% CI, −0.61 to 0.08). The time to the occurrence of the primary outcome and its two components are shown in Figure 2 .\n\n【41】The incidence of the primary efficacy outcome both overall and according to creatinine clearance is shown in Table 2 . Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy outcome are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix . There were no significant interactions between subgroups and trial regimen.\n\n【42】Figure 3.

Kaplan–Meier Cumulative Event Rates for Composite Secondary Outcomes and Death from Any Cause.\n\n【43】Shown are cumulative event rates for the composite of symptomatic VTE or death from any cause (Panel A), the composite of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or cardiovascular death (death due to a known cardiovascular cause or death in which a cardiovascular cause, including pulmonary embolism, could not be ruled out) (Panel B), and death from any cause (Panel C). In each panel, the inset shows the same data on an expanded y axis.\n\n【44】Since superiority was not established in the primary efficacy analysis, the prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes were assessed as exploratory analyses without adjustment for multiplicity ( Table 2 ). The time to the occurrence of each secondary outcome is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 .\n\n【45】Safety Outcomes\n---------------\n\n【46】The principal safety outcome of major bleeding occurred in 17 (0.28%) of 5982 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 9 (0.15%) of 5980 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.84 to 4.23) ( Table 2 ). The difference in risk (rivaroxaban minus placebo) was 0.13 percentage points (95% CI, −0.03 to 0.30). The incidence of major bleeding according to the prespecified stratification based on creatinine clearance is shown in Table 2 .\n\n【47】Subgroup analyses of major bleeding are shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix . There were no significant interactions between the trial regimen and any subgroup variable, with the exception of the duration of the index hospitalization (P=0.02) and in-hospital receipt of thromboprophylaxis (P=0.03).\n\n【48】The incidence of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding and other bleeding is shown in Table 2 . Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the rivaroxaban group and the placebo group (Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ). A total of 160 patients died during the 45-day treatment phase (71 in the rivaroxaban group and 89 in the placebo group). The causes of death are given in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this trial involving medically ill patients, rivaroxaban treatment that was started at the time of discharge from the hospital and continued for 45 days was not associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary efficacy outcome of fatal or symptomatic venous thromboembolism than placebo. Therefore, all the subsequent efficacy analyses were exploratory. Although rivaroxaban had no effect on the risk of venous thromboembolism–related death, it was associated with fewer symptomatic venous thromboembolic events than placebo (risk difference, −0.24 percentage points). The incidence of major bleeding during treatment with rivaroxaban was low (0.28%; difference in risk vs. placebo, 0.13 percentage points). These differences in risk suggest that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one symptomatic venous thromboembolism event is 430, whereas the number needed to cause one major bleed is 856. Thus, although the benefit–risk decision for the individual patient is finely tuned, the implementation of extended thromboprophylaxis with appropriate selection of medically ill patients may reduce the health burden of nonfatal venous thromboembolism in this population.\n\n【51】The rationale for extended thromboprophylaxis is to prevent symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis and nonfatal and fatal pulmonary embolism. Although we observed fewer symptomatic venous thromboembolic events with rivaroxaban than with placebo, no significant difference in venous thromboembolism–related mortality was observed. This observation is consistent with previously published trials of either short- or extended-duration prophylaxis in medical patients. <sup><a>8-11,14,15 </a></sup> The incidence of venous thromboembolism–related death in the placebo group (0.77%) was higher than in trials of other direct oral anticoagulants. <sup><a>8,10 </a></sup> Most of these deaths were sudden deaths in which pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out. The definition of venous thromboembolism–related death has varied across contemporary trials of extended thromboprophylaxis, and not all these trials have included unexplained sudden death. <sup><a>8-10 </a></sup> The broader definition we used probably included some deaths that were not due to pulmonary embolism, which suggests that sudden death of unknown cause is not sufficiently specific for inclusion in the definition of fatal pulmonary embolism. Conversely, death from any cause includes death from thrombotic causes other than pulmonary embolism, which may explain why the composite outcome of symptomatic venous thromboembolism and death from any cause was less frequent in the rivaroxaban group.\n\n【52】In a previous trial involving medically ill patients, treatment with rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg once daily started in the hospital and continued for 35 days reduced venous thromboembolism but increased major bleeding. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> Therefore, one goal of the current trial was to improve the safety of rivaroxaban in this population. This goal was achieved, as shown by lower incidences of major bleeding than in the previous trial. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> Safety was enhanced by initiating rivaroxaban at discharge, reducing the dose to 7.5 mg daily in patients with moderate renal impairment, and excluding patients who were identified as being at high risk for bleeding in the previous trial. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> The latter group included patients who had active cancer or gastrointestinal ulcer, bronchiectasis, or bleeding in the previous 3 months or were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【53】Patients with renal insufficiency have a higher incidence of thrombotic and bleeding events <sup><a>16,17 </a></sup> than patients with normal renal function. In the previous trial, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> rivaroxaban at 10 mg daily was effective in patients with moderate renal insufficiency but was associated with increased bleeding. In the current trial, the 7.5-mg daily dose of rivaroxaban given to patients with moderate renal insufficiency was associated with a low incidence of bleeding but not with a lower risk of the primary efficacy outcome than placebo. Similarly, the betrixaban dose-reduction strategy in medically ill patients showed less efficacy. <sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【54】This large trial of extended thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients had strengths and limitations. The strengths included the use of symptomatic events as the primary efficacy outcome, a low rate of loss to follow-up, and independent event adjudication. Despite the use of a validated risk score and elevated d \\-dimer levels to enrich the rate of primary events, the incidence in the placebo group was 1.1% rather than the expected 2.5%. Given the expected increase in d \\-dimer levels with age, it is possible that the cutoff we used for this assay (i.e., twice the upper limit of the normal range) led to the inclusion of participants whose risk was lower than expected. The low incidence prompted the decision to stop enrollment before accumulation of the prespecified 161 patients with primary events. Other limitations included the difficulty in defining venous thromboembolism–related death and the possible underdosing of patients with moderate renal impairment. In this trial, we did not record all the patients who were assessed for inclusion and from among whom the population that underwent randomization was selected. However, previous studies indicate that our inclusion criteria would represent approximately 25 to 30% of all hospitalized medical patients. <sup><a>3,4,18</a></sup>\n\n【55】In conclusion, our trial did not show a significant benefit of this rivaroxaban regimen started at hospital discharge with regard to the composite outcome of fatal or symptomatic venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients. Given the relatively low incidence of events despite the enrichment strategy and the lack of effect on venous thromboembolism–related death, the usefulness of extended thromboprophylaxis remains uncertain. Future studies should more accurately identify deaths caused by thrombotic mechanisms and focus on the patients who are at highest risk and who may benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis.\n\n【56】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【57】Supported by Janssen Research and Development .\n\n【58】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【59】Dr. Spyropoulos reports receiving advisory board fees from Daiichi Sankyo and Portola, grant support, consulting fees, and advisory board fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and Janssen, consulting fees and advisory board fees from Bayer, and a stipend from ATLAS Group (Colorado Prevention Center); Dr. Ageno, receiving grant support and advisory board fees from Bayer and BMS Pfizer and advisory board fees from Portola, Daiichi Sankyo, Aspen, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi; Dr. Albers, receiving consulting fees from Bayer; Dr. Elliott, receiving fees for serving on a steering committee from Bayer and lecture fees from the University of Cincinnati and Spectrum Health; Dr. Halperin, receiving consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, ATLAS Group (Colorado Prevention Center), Johnson & Johnson, and Ortho-McNeil-Janssen; Dr. Hiatt, receiving grant support from Janssen and Bayer; Dr. Steg, receiving grant support and fees for serving on a steering committee from Bayer/Janssen, grant support and lecture fees from Merck, grant support, consulting fees, lecture fees, and fees for serving as cochair of the ODYSSEY outcomes trial and the SCORED trial from Sanofi, grant support and fees for serving as chair of the CLARIFY registry from Servier, consulting fees and fees for serving on the executive steering committee for the REDUCE IT trial from Amarin, consulting fees and lecture fees from Amgen, consulting fees, lecture fees, and fees for critical event committee work from Bristol-Myers Squibb, fees for serving on the executive steering committee of the REDUAL PCI trial from Boehringer Ingelheim, fees for critical event committee work from Pfizer, consulting fees and fees for serving on the executive steering committee for the PARADISE MI trial from Novartis, consulting fees from Regeneron and Lilly, and consulting fees and fees for serving as cochair of the THEMIS trial from AstraZeneca; Dr. Weitz, receiving consulting fees and honoraria from Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Daiichi Sankyo, Ionis, Janssen, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Portola; Dr. Suh and Dr. Barnathan, being employed by Janssen Research and Development and owning stock in Johnson & Johnson; Dr. Spiro, being employed by and owning shares in Bayer U.S.; and Dr. Raskob, receiving consulting fees from Bayer, BMS, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Portola, and Novartis and consulting fees and honoraria from Daiichi Sankyo and Pfizer.

Salt substitutes, which replace part of the sodium chloride in regular salt with potassium chloride, combine these effects in a single product. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> Salt substitutes are available in many countries worldwide <sup><a>7 </a></sup> and have proven blood-pressure–lowering effects in diverse populations. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> However, in the absence of well-powered, randomized, controlled trials, there are uncertainties about the effects of salt substitutes on serious disease outcomes such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and death. In addition, concern about the theoretical risks of hyperkalemia and associated sudden death from the use of salt substitutes in patients with serious kidney disease has adversely influenced perceptions of clinicians and the general population. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> The Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS) <sup><a>8 </a></sup> was designed to define the overall balance of benefits and risks of salt substitute as compared with regular salt on stroke, cardiovascular events, death, and clinical hyperkalemia.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【16】Participants were enrolled in the current trial from April 2014 through January 2015. The SSaSS was an open-label, cluster-randomized trial that was conducted in 600 villages in the rural areas of five provinces in China — Hebei, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. The provinces were selected on the basis of established collaborations with local academic and government institutions. Two counties within each province were chosen according to their willingness to participate, their proximity to the local research team, and their being broadly representative of the level of socioeconomic development in the rural counties in the province. In each of the 10 counties, 60 villages were recruited through a group consent process that involved the leadership of each village and the local county bureaus of health. The goal was to recruit approximately 35 persons from each village and to follow each participant for 5 years. The trial was approved by the ethics committees at the Peking University Health Science Center in China and the University of Sydney in Australia, and all participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【17】The trial was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, but completion was delayed until the first quarter of 2021 because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and regulatory requirements in China. The scheduled final 5-year follow-up visits were conducted later than planned for about a fifth of participants, but use of the assigned substitute or regular salt was continued during this period. The trial was sponsored by the George Institute for Global Health, where the analyses were performed. The statistical analysis plan, which is provided with the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), was finalized and posted before unblinding of the data. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author, and all the authors participated in the subsequent revisions and the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【18】Participants\n------------\n\n【19】Participants were adult men and women who had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg if receiving blood-pressure–lowering medication or ≥160 mm Hg if not). Participants were required to provide personal identifiers and could be contacted by telephone or through a friend or relative whom they had nominated. Persons were excluded if they or someone living in their household had a potential contraindication to the salt substitute used in the trial; contraindications included use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, use of a potassium supplement, or known serious kidney disease. Routine biochemical measurement of kidney function was not performed. Persons were also ineligible if they were considered to be unlikely to live longer than 6 months or ate most meals outside of the home.\n\n【20】Randomization and Follow-up\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Villages were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group, in which the participants used a salt substitute, or to the control group, in which the participants continued to use regular salt. Randomization was stratified according to county with the use of a central computerized process. Random assignment of the villages was performed only after all the participants in the province had been recruited and all baseline survey data had been collected. Participants in the intervention villages were provided reduced-sodium salt substitute free-of-charge as a replacement for regular salt. The salt substitute was manufactured in accordance with the Chinese national standard and had a composition of 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride. Sufficient salt substitute was provided to cover all household cooking and food preservation requirements at an average of approximately 20 g per person per day. Participants were advised to use the salt substitute instead of regular salt for all cooking, seasoning, and food preservation purposes and were encouraged to use the salt substitute more sparingly, and not more frequently, than they had previously used salt to maximize the reduction in sodium achieved. Participants in the control villages continued to use regular salt as they usually would. General health advice about stroke prevention, which included a recommendation to reduce salt intake, was provided at trial commencement to all villages but was not reinforced thereafter. Use of other medical therapy was permitted according to local guidelines.\n\n【22】Follow-up was conducted at 6-month intervals and focused on the identification of trial outcomes, hospitalizations, and other serious illnesses. If a possible trial outcome was identified, then additional information was collected by asking participants to complete a structured questionnaire, by photographing documentation held by the participant or family members, and by seeking data from any medical facilities that the participant had visited during the illness. Supplementary data were also sought from the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> the County Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and the Public Security Bureau as appropriate. Scheduled follow-up visits during the first 2 years after randomization and the final 5-year visit were conducted in person for all participants. In the intervals between visits, potential events were identified only through linkage to databases of routinely collected health insurance records held within the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and National Mortality Surveillance System. <sup><a>10 </a></sup> During years 3 and 4, only persons with potential trial outcome events were seen face-to-face in order to collect additional information for adjudication of the event. The exception was Changzhi county in Shanxi province, where in-person follow-up visits were conducted at 6-month intervals throughout the trial period. Every 12 months, a targeted subgroup of participants from between 54 and 140 villages were visited to measure 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion, blood pressure, and adherence to the assigned use of substitute or regular salt. <sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【23】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【24】The primary outcome was stroke, which was defined as an acute disturbance of focal neurologic function resulting in death or symptoms lasting more than 24 hours. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, or death from vascular causes) and death from any cause. The safety outcome was clinical hyperkalemia; sudden death was also assessed as a key indicator of safety. Routine serum potassium measurements were not performed. Imaging, clinical, and laboratory data regarding primary, secondary, and safety outcomes were collected whenever possible. All potential efficacy and safety outcome events were reviewed by an end-point adjudication committee, according to standardized definitions provided in an end-point adjudication charter (see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org); the members of the committee were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Potential outcome events were assigned causes and were further classified as definite, probable, possible, or unlikely, according to the information contained in the supporting evidence. Primary analyses included data from participants who had definite or probable outcome events. The exception was the safety outcome of clinical hyperkalemia; only two events were classified as definite or probable, and a post hoc decision was made to also include possible events in the analysis.\n\n【25】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【26】We estimated that a sample size of 21,000 participants in 600 clusters (300 in the salt-substitute group and 300 in the regular-salt group, with 35 participants in each cluster) would provide the trial with 90% power to detect a proportional difference of 13% or more in the rate of stroke between the participants who used the salt substitute and those who used regular salt at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> Primary analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adjustment for clustering was made with the use of a hierarchical Poisson regression model, with follow-up time as an offset; rate ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values were used to compare the effects of the salt substitute and regular salt. Follow-up continued up to the date of the scheduled final 5-year follow-up visit (at which time vital status was determined for all participants) or to the date of death, whichever occurred first. With respect to nonfatal events, the completeness of follow-up was calculated on the basis of the date of death (as determined from a search of health insurance records of all deceased participants), the date of the final in-person follow-up visit, the date of final contact with a family member or other nominated contact, or the date of the final search of routinely collected health data, whichever represented the longest period from randomization. Adjustment for multiplicity in the analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes was performed post hoc with the use of the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Cumulative event curves were generated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. Summary effects on continuous outcomes were determined from a fixed-effect, inverse-variance–weighted meta-analysis of the differences at each year of follow-up, which were estimated on the basis of an analysis of covariance that allowed for clustering. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\n【27】Results\n-------\n\n【28】Participants\n------------\n\n【29】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up.\n\n【30】A total of 20,995 persons were recruited from 600 villages and were assigned to a trial group; 4172 died during the trial. Among the living participants, 15,130 were seen face-to-face at the scheduled final follow-up visit, 1357 had final follow-up through communication with a nominated contact, 317 had final follow-up through record linkage that was completed 2 to 67 weeks before the scheduled final follow-up, and 19 had a final in-person follow-up visit 23 to 51 weeks before the scheduled time. Vital status was determined for all the participants. Nonfatal events were assessed among the participants for 99,473 of 99,522 person-years (>99.9%) of scheduled follow-up ( Figure 1 ), and the overall mean and median durations of follow-up were 4.74 and 5.12 years, respectively. At the 5-year follow-up, 91.7% of the participants in the salt-substitute group and 6.4% of those in the regular-salt group reported using a salt substitute.\n\n【31】Among the participants at baseline, the mean age was 65.4 years, 49.5% were female, 72.6% had a history of stroke, and 88.4% reported having received a diagnosis of hypertension. The mean blood pressure was 154.0/89.2 mm Hg, and 79.3% of the participants were using at least one blood-pressure–lowering medication — 41.8% were using a calcium antagonist, 22.8% an angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, 11.5% a diuretic, 5.7% a beta-blocker, and 0.9% an alpha-blocker. The mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 4.3 g (187 mmol), and the mean 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g (36 mmol). Baseline characteristics were balanced between the trial groups (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【32】Intermediate Markers of Cardiovascular Risk\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Effects of Salt Substitution on Blood Pressure and 24-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion.\n\n【34】Systolic (Panel A) and diastolic (Panel B) blood pressure was measured in all participants at baseline, and the differences in blood pressure for each year were derived from paired comparisons that were adjusted for clustering. Twenty-four hour urinary sodium (Panel C) and potassium (Panel D) excretion were measured in only a subgroup of participants at baseline and at each year of follow-up, and the differences for each year were derived from unpaired comparisons in an analysis of covariance adjusted for clustering. Overall differences were calculated with a fixed-effect, inverse-variance–weighted meta-analysis of the differences at each year of follow-up. The size of the boxes is proportional to the inverse variance of the effect estimates. To convert the values for sodium to milligrams, multiply by 23, and to convert the values for potassium to milligrams, multiply by 39.\n\n【35】Across the follow-up period, the mean difference in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion between the salt-substitute group and the regular-salt group was −350 mg (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −545 to −154) (−15.2 mmol; 95% CI, −23.7 to −6.7), and the mean difference in 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was 803 mg (95% CI, 714 to 897) (20.6 mmol; 95% CI, 18.3 to 23.0). The mean difference in systolic blood pressure was −3.34 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.51 to −2.18) ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【36】Cardiovascular Outcomes and Death\n---------------------------------\n\n【37】Table 1. Table 1. Effects of Salt Substitution on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Death. Figure 3.  Figure 3. Effects of Salt Substitution on Trial Outcomes.\n\n【38】Shown are the effects of salt substitute, as compared with regular salt, on the primary outcome of stroke (Panel A), the secondary outcomes of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, or death from vascular causes) (Panel B) and death from any cause (Panel C), and the safety outcome of hyperkalemia (Panel D). P values were estimated with the use of Poisson regression models. The prespecified analyses of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, and death from any cause included definite and probable events, but the analysis of hyperkalemia included definite, probable, and possible events because only two events were classified as definite or probable. In each panel, the inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.Figure 4.  Figure 4. Subgroup Analysis of the Effects of Salt Substitution on the Primary Outcome of Stroke.\n\n【39】“Less educated” indicates primary school or lower, and “more educated” junior high school or higher. The size of the boxes is proportional to the inverse variance of the effect estimates. The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.\n\n【40】The rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke events was significantly lower in the salt-substitute group than in the regular-salt group (29.14 events vs. 33.65 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.96; P=0.006) ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ). Point estimates of the effects of the salt substitute and regular salt favored the salt substitute with respect to all predefined exploratory outcomes of stroke ( Table 1 ). The effects of the salt substitute and regular salt on stroke consistently favored the salt substitute across a broad range of prespecified participant subgroups ( Figure 4 ). As compared with regular salt, the salt substitute was also shown to protect against the secondary outcomes of major adverse cardiovascular events (49.1 events vs. 56.3 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; P<0.001) and death from any cause (39.3 events vs. 44.6 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95; P<0.001) ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ). The salt substitute was also shown to be beneficial with respect to death from vascular causes (22.9 events vs. 26.3 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) and nonfatal acute coronary syndrome (3.8 events vs. 5.1 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93) but not with respect to nonfatal stroke (22.4 events vs. 24.9 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.01) ( Table 1 ). Point estimates of the effects of the salt substitute and regular salt favored the salt substitute with respect to all exploratory outcomes of death ( Table 1 ).\n\n【41】Safety Outcomes\n---------------\n\n【42】There were two participants who had definite or probable hyperkalemia (one in the salt-substitute group and one in the regular-salt group). An additional 313 participants, including 302 who died and 11 who had a nonfatal event, were identified as having possible hyperkalemia. There was no evidence of a significant difference between the trial groups in the analyses that included data from participants who had definite, probable, or possible hyperkalemic events, either in the overall population (3.35 events vs. 3.30 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.37; P=0.76) or in any participant subgroup (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【43】Discussion\n----------\n\n【44】In the present trial, the participants who received the salt substitute had significantly lower rates of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, and death from any cause than those who received regular salt. The observed benefits from the salt substitute were broadly consistent across participant subgroups and prespecified exploratory outcome analyses of stroke, other vascular events, and death. Use of the salt substitute was not associated with any apparent serious adverse effects.\n\n【45】The sizes of the effects on outcomes of stroke observed in our trial are in keeping with our power estimates at trial inception and are in accordance with a mechanism of action mediated through blood-pressure reduction. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> The observed changes in 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion are of a magnitude consistent with the measured decline in systolic blood pressure. Sodium reduction and potassium supplementation have been shown to independently lower blood pressure and to have synergistic effects. <sup><a>4,5,13,14 </a></sup> Although a systematic review and meta-analysis of other studies showed larger effects of salt substitution on blood pressure, all of these studies were of shorter duration than the current trial. <sup><a>15 </a></sup> Incomplete adherence to the use of the salt substitute, consumption of regular salt outside the home, and some use of a salt substitute in the control group probably attenuated the magnitude of the treatment effects in the current trial.\n\n【46】The absence of any evident increased risk of clinical hyperkalemia addresses concerns about the potential harms from the use of salt substitutes. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> Persons at risk of hyperkalemia were excluded if they reported serious kidney disease or the use of medicines that might substantially elevate blood potassium levels. There was no biochemical prescreening of kidney function or potassium levels, and there was concomitant use of drugs blocking the renin–angiotensin system in approximately a quarter of participants. However, we searched systematically for all serious adverse events potentially attributable to hyperkalemia and did not identify any increased risk of this outcome. We also found no increased risk of sudden death that might be caused by hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmic events. Our data also provide reassurance about the efficacy and safety of sodium-intake reduction for the prevention of cardiovascular events and death. There was no apparent evidence of an increased risk of any cardiovascular or other adverse outcome among the participants, who had a mean baseline 24-hour sodium excretion level of 187 mmol per day (equivalent to 10.75 g of salt and 4.3 g of sodium), which is only slightly above the average global intake. <sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【47】In the absence of well-powered, randomized, controlled trials, previous attempts to estimate the effects of sodium reduction or potassium supplementation on cardiovascular disease have relied mainly on observational data, which are subject to various biases and confounding. <sup><a>17,18 </a></sup> In contrast, the current trial used a robust, randomized design, was large, and had a long duration with many outcome events.\n\n【48】This trial has several notable limitations. Potassium was not measured serially, and elevated potassium levels might have been missed in some participants. Only one preparation of salt substitute was used, and thus graded decreases in sodium intake, which might have induced graded responses, were not evaluated. Although the delivery of the intervention was not concealed, the risk of bias was minimized with the use of objective primary and secondary end points and standardized methods for the identification of outcome events, including ascertainment through systematic searches of routinely collected health data and verification by an independent end-point adjudication committee, the members of which were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Information that could be used for adjudication of outcome events was limited, and definitive assignment of causation was difficult in many cases. We investigated the potential effect of misclassification of end points on effect estimates but found no evidence that certainty of adjudications had any substantive implications for the primary conclusions of the trial.\n\n【49】We note that the magnitude of protection observed in this trial is similar to that assumed in a recent modeling study that estimated that 365,000 strokes, 461,000 premature deaths, and 1,204,000 vascular events could be averted each year by the population-wide use of a salt substitute in China. <sup><a>19 </a></sup> Large benefits might also be achieved in other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in which salt intake is above recommended levels. <sup><a>20 </a></sup> Furthermore, because it is primarily persons in low-income and disadvantaged populations who add large quantities of salt to their diet during food preparation and cooking, <sup><a>21 </a></sup> salt substitution — a practical, low-cost intervention (about $1.62 per kilogram of salt substitute vs. $1.08 per kilogram of regular salt in China) — may have the potential to reduce health inequities related to cardiovascular disease.\n\n【50】In this trial comparing a salt substitute with regular salt among persons who had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had high blood pressure, the rates of stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death from any cause were lower with the salt substitute, which had no apparent serious adverse effects.\n\n【51】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【52】Supported by research grants (APP1164206 and APP1049417) and an investigator grant (APP1197709, to Dr. Neal) from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; the salt substitute used in the trial was purchased by the investigators from local manufacturers in each province for years 1, 2, and 5 but was donated by Jiangsu Sinokone Technology for years 3 to 4.\n\n【53】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【54】Drs.

For example, your patients in the older groups and high-risk cardiovascular individuals are highly likely to get aspirins &/or NSAIDs for stroke prevention or pain syndromes (highly prevalent in this age group), drugs that are known effects of lowering kidney function. Moreover as you declared ACEI/ARBs had been used in about 1/4rth of your study population, drugs that are likely to retain potassium and reduce kidney function as well. It would be nice if you could provide an intragroup analysis of data (retrospective if prospective not possible) from potential significant harmful effects of the mentioned drugs on patients in the salt substitution group (for example those who attended emergency departments or hospitalized) & their lab tests, versus patients of the same group who weren't receiving those drugs.\n\n【81】Mao-Li Xia  \nSep 16, 2021\n\n【82】Mao-Li Xia  \nPhysician, Rheumatology  \nDisclosure: None  \n_China_\n\n【83】Geographic Variation in Incidence and Mortality of Stroke and CVD\n\n【84】We note that approximately 20% of the participants were from northeast China where there was the highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke, \\[1\\] as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) in mainland China. As compared with the other regions in the trial, the unhealthy eating habits (low intake of fruits or vegetables, and high intake of red meat, pickled vegetables or salt) in northeast China, may contribute to the significant geographic variation in both incidence and mortality of stroke or CVD. However, the recommendation about stroke prevention (include reducing salt intake) provided at trial commencement to participants was not reinforced thereafter. Thus,it is unclear whether there are imbalanced changes in the eating habits of participants from Liaoning (in northeast China) between the two groups, which may result in potential biases in the observed points. We would like to see the disclosure of the related trial details. Mao-Li Xia, Yue Bei People’s Hospital, Shaoguan, China References 1.Wang W, Jiang B, Sun H et al.

We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to compare the effect of this therapy, delivered at two different levels of intensity, on 90-day mortality among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned critically ill adults with acute kidney injury to continuous renal-replacement therapy in the form of postdilution continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with an effluent flow of either 40 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour (higher intensity) or 25 ml per kilogram per hour (lower intensity). The primary outcome measure was death within 90 days after randomization.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the 1508 enrolled patients, 747 were randomly assigned to higher-intensity therapy, and 761 to lower-intensity therapy with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Data on primary outcomes were available for 1464 patients (97.1%): 721 in the higher-intensity group and 743 in the lower-intensity group. The two study groups had similar baseline characteristics and received the study treatment for an average of 6.3 and 5.9 days, respectively (P=0.35). At 90 days after randomization, 322 deaths had occurred in the higher-intensity group and 332 deaths in the lower-intensity group, for a mortality of 44.7% in each group (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.81 to 1.23; P=0.99). At 90 days, 6.8% of survivors in the higher-intensity group (27 of 399), as compared with 4.4% of survivors in the lower-intensity group (18 of 411), were still receiving renal-replacement therapy (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.92; P=0.14). Hypophosphatemia was more common in the higher-intensity group than in the lower-intensity group (65% vs. 54%, P<0.001).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, treatment with higher-intensity continuous renal-replacement therapy did not reduce mortality at 90 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00221013 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Acute kidney injury is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> It is a common finding among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) <sup><a>2 </a></sup> and is an independent predictor of mortality. <sup><a>3 </a></sup> Acute kidney injury severe enough to result in the use of renal-replacement therapy affects approximately 5% of patients admitted to the ICU and is associated with a mortality rate of 60%. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> The optimal approach to renal-replacement therapy, as well as the optimal intensity and timing of such therapy, in critically ill patients remains unclear. In one single-center, randomized, controlled study in which continuous renal-replacement therapy was the sole treatment approach, survival improved when the intensity of therapy was increased from an assigned effluent rate of 20 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour to either 35 or 45 ml per kilogram per hour. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> However, subsequent single-center studies have had conflicting results. <sup><a>6-8</a></sup>\n\n【12】The recently reported Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00076219) <sup><a>9 </a></sup> showed that increasing the intensity of renal-replacement therapy did not decrease mortality among patients with acute kidney injury. In contrast to other studies, which used continuous renal-replacement therapy exclusively, this study assigned patients to a protocol of either intermittent or continuous renal-replacement therapy according to whether they were hemodynamically stable or unstable, respectively. This design reflects clinical practice in the United States and elsewhere but makes it difficult to carry out a formal comparison of treatment intensities that would be independent of the particular treatment approach. We conducted a randomized, controlled study to test the hypothesis that increasing the intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy would reduce mortality at 90 days.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】The Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial designed to assess two levels of intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. The study was conducted between December 30, 2005, and November 28, 2008, in 35 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. The study protocol is outlined in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. It was approved by the human research ethics committees of the University of Sydney and all participating institutions. The integrity of data collection was verified by the George Institute for International Health monitoring team. An independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety data and interim results with the aim of providing advice to the trial management committee should such analyses prove beyond a reasonable doubt that augmented continuous renal-replacement therapy led to a net benefit or harm in terms of mortality.\n\n【16】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【17】Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were critically ill, were 18 years of age or older, had acute kidney injury, were deemed by the treating clinician to require renal-replacement therapy, and met at least one of the following criteria: oliguria (urine output <100 ml in a 6-hour period) that was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation measures, a serum potassium concentration exceeding 6.5 mmol per liter, severe acidemia (pH <7.2), a plasma urea nitrogen level above 70 mg per deciliter (25 mmol per liter), a serum creatinine concentration above 3.4 mg per deciliter (300 μmol per liter), or the presence of clinically significant organ edema (e.g., pulmonary edema). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or responsible surrogate by means of either a priori or delayed consent. (For a detailed description of delayed consent, see the Supplementary Appendix .)\n\n【18】Patients who had received any previous renal-replacement therapy during the same hospital admission or who were on maintenance dialysis for end-stage kidney disease were ineligible for the study. (For a detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria and the criteria for discontinuing the study treatment, see the Supplementary Appendix .)\n\n【19】Intervention\n------------\n\n【20】The patients in both groups were treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Replacement fluid was delivered into the extracorporeal circuit after the filter (i.e., postdilution), with a ratio of dialysate to replacement fluid of 1:1. The effluent flow prescribed was based on the patient's body weight at the time of randomization and was either 40 ml per kilogram per hour (for the higher-intensity group) or 25 ml per kilogram per hour (for the lower-intensity group). Blood flow was kept above 150 ml per minute. Fluid was removed by decreasing the flow of the replacement fluid and of the dialysate in equal proportion, so that effluent exceeded them both by any amount prescribed by the clinician. Filters with the AN69 membrane (Gambro) were used. Hemosol BO fluid (Gambro) was used as the dialysate and replacement fluid. Gambro had no role in the initiation, design, analysis, or reporting of the study.\n\n【21】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【22】The primary study outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary and tertiary outcomes included death within 28 days after randomization, death in the ICU, in-hospital death, cessation of renal-replacement therapy, duration of ICU and hospital stays, duration of mechanical ventilation and renal-replacement therapy, dialysis status at day 90, and any new organ failures.\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【24】All statistical analyses were conducted according to a predefined plan. <sup><a>10,11 </a></sup> The target enrollment was 1500 patients, which provided 90% power to detect an 8.5% absolute reduction in 90-day mortality from a baseline of 60% (alpha level, <0.05). Two interim analyses were performed and reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee. Since the Haybittle–Peto rule with a maximum of three analyses was used to limit the overall probability of a type I error to 0.05, the final analysis was conducted at an alpha level of 0.048.\n\n【25】All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, with no imputation for missing values. Data from patients who were lost to follow-up were not analyzed. Proportions were compared with the use of the chi-square test, and continuous variables were analyzed with the use of Student's t-test. Mantel–Haenszel adjusted odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Analysis of the primary outcome for the two groups was also performed by means of the log-rank test, with the results presented as a Kaplan–Meier cumulative-incidence plot.\n\n【26】Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence or absence of sepsis; failure of one or more nonrenal organs; a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) cardiovascular score of 3 or 4 at baseline (on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, with a higher score indicating more severe organ dysfunction); and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml per minute within 6 months prior to randomization. We assessed subgroups for heterogeneity of treatment effect according to accepted clinical guidelines. <sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【27】Statistical analyses were performed, independently checked, and replicated with the use of SAS software, version 9.1.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Enrollment\n----------\n\n【30】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Numbers of Patients Enrolled in the Study, Randomly Assigned to a Treatment Group, and Included in the Analysis.\n\n【31】Between December 1, 2005, and August 31, 2008, we enrolled 1508 patients, of whom 747 were assigned to the higher-intensity treatment group and 761 to the lower-intensity treatment group ( Figure 1 ). Consent was subsequently withheld or withdrawn for 43 patients (2.9%), 25 of whom had been assigned to higher-intensity therapy and 18 to lower-intensity therapy; only 1 patient was lost to follow-up, thus the primary outcome was available for 1464 patients (97.1%).\n\n【32】Baseline Characteristics\n------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Patients.\n\n【34】All baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups ( Table 1 ). The serum creatinine concentrations before randomization in the higher-intensity and lower-intensity treatment groups were 3.8 mg per deciliter (338 μmol per liter) and 3.7 mg per deciliter (330 μmol per liter), respectively. In all, 73.9% of patients were receiving mechanical ventilation, 49.4% had severe sepsis, and 82.5% were receiving vasoactive drugs.\n\n【35】Study and Supportive Treatments\n-------------------------------\n\n【36】Table 2.  Table 2. Characteristics of Study Treatments and Subsequent Use of Renal-Replacement Therapy.\n\n【37】Table 2 lists the characteristics of the study therapy. The mean duration of treatment in the two groups was similar, but during therapy, they had significantly different mean daily serum creatinine concentrations (1.9 mg per deciliter \\[170 μmol per liter\\] in the higher-intensity group vs. 2.3 mg per deciliter \\[204 μmol per liter\\] in the lower-intensity group, P<0.001) and blood urea nitrogen levels (35.6 mg per deciliter \\[12.7 mmol per liter\\] vs. 44.5 mg per deciliter \\[15.9 mmol per liter\\], P<0.001). These differences were consistent with the difference in the intensity of the delivered treatment (mean effluent rate, 33.4 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour in the higher-intensity group vs. 22.0 in the lower-intensity group; P<0.001). Patients receiving higher-intensity continuous renal-replacement therapy were more likely to receive regional extracorporeal-circuit anticoagulation with heparin and protamine (P=0.007) and required more filters per day (0.93 vs. 0.84, P<0.001). Only 7.6% and 7.0% of the patients in the higher-intensity and the lower-intensity groups, respectively, underwent intermittent hemodialysis at any time during their ICU stay, for a total of 314 dialysis sessions by day 28 after randomization.\n\n【38】Treatment Limitations\n---------------------\n\n【39】Among patients who died, limitations of ICU treatment were instituted for 289 of 322 patients in the higher-intensity group and 301 of 332 patients in the lower-intensity group (89.8% and 90.7%, respectively; P=0.52). Among these patients, treatment was withdrawn or limited because death was considered to be imminent in 219 of 322 patients in the higher-intensity group and in 232 of 332 patients in the lower-intensity group (68.0% and 69.9%, respectively; P=0.49). Intensive treatment was withheld, since further maximal therapy was not indicated in 70 patients (21.7%) in the higher-intensity group and in 69 patients (20.8%) in the lower-intensity group.\n\n【40】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【41】Table 3. Table 3. Primary and Secondary Outcomes. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Probability of Death.\n\n【42】Mortality at 28 days was similar in the higher-intensity and lower-intensity treatment groups (38.5% and 36.9%, respectively), and mortality at 90 days was the same (44.7%) in both groups.Figure 3.  Figure 3. Mortality in the Prespecified Subgroups and among All Patients.\n\n【43】Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are shown for deaths in the four prespecified subgroups for both treatment pairs and for death from any cause by day 90 for all patients. CI denotes confidence interval, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, and SOFA Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (range of scores, 0 to 4). Larger squares represent greater numbers of patients.\n\n【44】Within 90 days after randomization, death occurred in 322 (44.7%) of 721 patients in the higher-intensity group and in 332 (44.7%) of 743 patients in the lower-intensity group (odds ratio in the higher-intensity group, 1.00; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.81 to 1.23; P=0.99) ( Table 3 and Figure 2 ). Mortality was also similar between the two treatment groups in all prespecified subgroups ( Figure 3 ).\n\n【45】Secondary and Tertiary Outcomes\n-------------------------------\n\n【46】There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary or tertiary outcomes ( Table 3 ). At 28 days after randomization, 64 patients (14.5% of survivors) in the higher-intensity group and 57 patients (12.2% of survivors) in the lower-intensity group were still receiving renal-replacement therapy. At 90 days, these numbers had dropped to 27 patients (6.8% of survivors) and 18 patients (4.4% of survivors), respectively (odds ratio in the higher-intensity group, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.92; P=0.14). Oliguria (urinary excretion, <400 ml per day) was present in 59.7% of patients at randomization.\n\n【47】Complications of Therapy\n------------------------\n\n【48】Table 4.  Table 4. Summary of Complications Associated with Study Treatment.\n\n【49】In the higher-intensity group, there were seven serious adverse events (three cases of the disequilibrium syndrome, one case of cerebral edema, one of rectal bleeding, one of cardiac arrest, and one of too rapid correction of hyponatremia) that were considered by the site investigators to be potentially related to treatment ( Table 4 ). In the lower-intensity group, there were five serious adverse events (three cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, one case of hypoxemia, and one of cardiogenic shock). Hypophosphatemia was detected in 461 patients (65.1%) in the higher-intensity group and in 396 patients (54.0%) in the lower-intensity group (P<0.001).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of the intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy, we found that the higher-intensity treatment did not decrease mortality as compared with the lower-intensity treatment. There were also no significant differences in the rate of recovery (i.e., cessation of dialysis because it was no longer needed) or in the occurrence of organ failure, the need for mechanical ventilation, time spent in the ICU, or time spent in the hospital.\n\n【52】Our findings do not agree with those of two previous randomized, controlled studies of continuous renal-replacement therapy intensity, <sup><a>5,6 </a></sup> which showed decreased mortality with increased intensity of treatment. In a study of 425 patients, Ronco et al. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> reported a decrease in mortality from 59 to 43% when the prescribed effluent flow was increased from 20 ml per kilogram per hour to 35 or 45 ml per kilogram per hour. In a similar study involving 206 patients, Saudan et al. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> observed a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at 90 days (from 61 to 41%) with an increase in the prescribed effluent flow from 25 ml per kilogram per hour to approximately 43 ml per kilogram per hour. However, the results in our study are consistent with those of two other randomized, controlled studies. Bouman et al. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> reported no increase in survival among 106 patients in a comparison of prescribed effluent flows of 48 and 20 ml per kilogram per hour. Similarly, Tolwani et al. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> found no difference in outcome among 200 patients randomly assigned to an effluent flow of either 20 or 35 ml per kilogram per hour.\n\n【53】The lower-intensity treatment in our trial was similar to that usually prescribed in ICUs in Australia and New Zealand <sup><a>13 </a></sup> and was also identical to that prescribed for the control group in one of the trials of continuous renal-replacement therapy intensity in which the results were positive. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> For the higher-intensity dose, we chose a value of 40 ml per kilogram per hour, which was intermediate between the two higher doses in the study by Ronco et al. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> and similar to the higher-intensity treatment group in the study by Saudan et al. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> In addition, the prescribed difference between treatment intensities (15 ml per kilogram per hour) in our study was identical to that prescribed in these studies. <sup><a>5,6,14 </a></sup> Although the target doses were always achieved when continuous renal-replacement therapy was delivered, treatments were frequently interrupted owing to clotting of the filter, surgery, diagnostic investigations, or other procedures. In the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> the dose delivered was 89% of that prescribed for higher-intensity treatment, whereas Tolwani et al. <sup><a>8 </a></sup> reported a value of 83% and the value in our study was 84%. For the lower-intensity treatment, the doses delivered were 95% in the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study as compared with 85% in the study by Tolwani et al. and 88% in our study. In all previous studies, delivered doses were less than 85% of the prescribed doses. <sup><a>15-17</a></sup>\n\n【54】Our findings are consistent with those of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> which used a combination of continuous and intermittent renal-replacement therapy. In contrast to that study, however, we used continuous renal-replacement therapy exclusively — the preferred approach to renal-replacement therapy in ICUs in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and many centers worldwide <sup><a>1,18 </a></sup> — and ours included patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease. <sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【55】Despite the similarities in primary outcome in our study and the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study, there were some differences in the characteristics of the patients. Our patients were older and had a lower body weight, a lower incidence of sepsis, and higher mean scores on the cardiovascular and respiratory system SOFA. There were also differences in the processes of care. Our patients had not undergone renal-replacement therapy before randomization, whereas 64% of patients in the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study had undergone renal-replacement therapy in the 24 hours before randomization. In our study, the mean time from ICU admission to randomization was 50 hours, as compared with 150 hours in the other trial. Finally, our patients received only 314 intermittent hemodialysis treatments during the study therapy phase, as compared with 5077 hemodialysis treatments in the other trial. The rate of dependence on dialysis among study survivors at 28 days was 15.8% in our study as compared with 45.2% in the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study and 5.6% at 90 days in our study, as compared with 24.6% at 60 days in the other study.\n\n【56】In our efforts to achieve a high degree of internal and external validity, we ensured allocation concealment before randomization and used a primary outcome that was not subject to ascertainment bias. We enrolled 88.8% of fully eligible patients, <sup><a>20 </a></sup> followed a predetermined statistical-analysis plan, <sup><a>10 </a></sup> and were able to follow up on all but one patient. The management of renal-replacement therapy was designed to be in accord with standard practice in Australia and New Zealand. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> Nearly all the patients received their assigned treatments, and there was a substantial difference in the intensity of the delivered doses of renal-replacement therapy. By including patients with preexisting stage 4 chronic kidney disease and by using continuous renal-replacement therapy (the preferred form of renal-replacement therapy in many countries and centers), we sought to increase the external validity of our results. We acknowledge, however, that a substantial number of the serum creatinine measurements within 6 months prior to randomization were unavailable ( Table 1 ), thus limiting the conclusions that could be drawn regarding the effect of chronic kidney disease on the study outcomes.\n\n【57】The trial had several limitations: the study personnel and staff were aware of patients' treatment status, the timing of dialysis initiation was not standardized, and data to assess the costs of the interventions were not gathered. In addition, operational characteristics such as frequent filter clotting could have influenced solute clearance. The difference between the prescribed dose and the delivered dose highlights the risk of overestimating the effective delivery of therapy and the need to improve operational measures in continuous renal-replacement therapy. Specifically, basing the delivered dose on effluent volume most likely overestimates true solute clearance. Future trials should measure solute clearance rather than simply relying on effluent volume. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that individual patients may benefit from personalized prescriptions. We did not use a prespecified creatinine clearance to trigger the cessation of therapy, since this was not standard practice in the study centers. Accordingly, we used cessation of renal-replacement therapy as a clinically relevant measure of the recovery of kidney function. The greater frequency of morning hypophosphatemia in the higher-intensity treatment group is consistent with the increased phosphate losses that would be expected with more intense treatment and was similarly noted in the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study. <sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【58】In countries where continuous renal-replacement therapy is now the preferred form of renal-replacement therapy in the ICU, our study has implications for clinical practice. We found that a prescribed treatment intensity that exceeds 25 ml of effluent flow per kilogram per hour adds no significant benefit and exposes patients to the risk of hypophosphatemia. There has been a widespread increase in the use of higher-intensity continuous renal-replacement therapy, <sup><a>4,19 </a></sup> and our findings indicate that such practice is not justified. However, it must be emphasized that the dose delivered in our lower-intensity group was higher than the doses that are used in many centers. <sup><a>4,15-17 </a></sup> Furthermore, the lower dose in our control group was associated with a lower mortality than was reported in a large international study of the treatment of acute renal failure in critically ill patients. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> Thus, our findings suggest not that the intensity of renal-replacement therapy is unimportant but rather that increases beyond an adequate level of intensity provide no additional benefit in critically ill patients. The results also suggest that some specific aspects of renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients — that is, the effect of the timing of treatment initiation on mortality and the effect of continuous as compared with intermittent treatment on renal recovery — should be prioritized for investigation in future trials.\n\n【59】In conclusion, this large, randomized, controlled trial showed that increasing the intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy from 25 to 40 ml of effluent flow per kilogram per hour does not reduce mortality or the rate of dependence on dialysis among critically ill patients.\n\n【60】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【61】Supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (352550) and the Health Research Council of New Zealand (06-357).\n\n【62】Dr. Bellomo reports receiving consulting fees from Gambro Biosite, Abbott Diagnostics, and Philips Medical Systems, and grant support from Fresenius Kabi, Bard, Pfizer, and Gambro; Dr. Cass, grant support from Fresenius Kabi, Roche, and Gambro; Dr. Finfer, travel support to present research results at scientific meetings from Eli Lilly, Cardinal Health, and CSL Bioplasma; Dr. Gallagher, lecture fees from Roche and Amgen; Dr. McArthur, grant support from Bard, Pfizer, and Gambro; and Dr. Myburgh, grant support from Fresenius Kabi.

We hypothesized that long-term use of tiotropium would improve lung function and ameliorate the decline in lung function in patients with mild or moderate COPD.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted in China, we randomly assigned 841 patients with COPD of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) severity to receive a once-daily inhaled dose (18 μg) of tiotropium (419 patients) or matching placebo (422) for 2 years. The primary end point was the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) before bronchodilator use. Secondary end points included the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use and the between-group difference in the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before and after bronchodilator use from day 30 to month 24.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of 841 patients who underwent randomization, 388 patients in the tiotropium group and 383 in the placebo group were included in the full analysis set. The FEV <sub>1 </sub> in patients who received tiotropium was higher than in those who received placebo throughout the trial (ranges of mean differences, 127 to 169 ml before bronchodilator use and 71 to 133 ml after bronchodilator use; P<0.001 for all comparisons). There was no significant amelioration of the mean (±SE) annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use: the decline was 38±6 ml per year in the tiotropium group and 53±6 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 15 ml per year; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −1 to 31; P=0.06). In contrast, the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was significantly less in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group (29±5 ml per year vs. 51±6 ml per year; difference, 22 ml per year \\[95% CI, 6 to 37\\]; P=0.006). The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the two groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Tiotropium resulted in a higher FEV <sub>1 </sub> than placebo at 24 months and ameliorated the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use in patients with COPD of GOLD stage 1 or 2. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim and others; Tie-COPD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01455129 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent disease, with a prevalence among people 40 years of age or older of 10.1% worldwide and 8.2% in China. <sup><a>1,2 </a></sup> COPD has become the third leading cause of death worldwide and is estimated to become the disease with the seventh greatest burden worldwide in 2030. <sup><a>3-5 </a></sup> More than 70% of patients with COPD have Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) disease, with very mild or no apparent respiratory symptoms such as exercise limitation and dyspnea. <sup><a>2,6 </a></sup> (Patients with GOLD stage 1 COPD have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second \\[FEV <sub>1 </sub> \\] of ≥80% of the predicted value, and those with GOLD stage 2 disease have an FEV <sub>1 </sub> between 50% and 79% of the predicted value.) This situation may account for infrequent physician consultations until their COPD is more advanced.\n\n【12】Tiotropium (Spiriva, Boehringer Ingelheim) is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that selectively binds to muscarinic receptors on smooth-muscle cells in the airway. Tiotropium ameliorates airflow limitation in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, reduces air trapping and exertional dyspnea, and improves exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life. <sup><a>7-9 </a></sup> In contrast, little is known about the treatment of COPD of GOLD stage 1 and early stage 2 (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ≥60% of the predicted value). In small trials and in subgroup analyses of trials involving patients with COPD, tiotropium therapy improved lung function (as measured by FEV <sub>1 </sub> and forced vital capacity \\[FVC\\]) in patients with GOLD stage 1 and early stage 2 disease. <sup><a>10,11 </a></sup> We conducted a prospective trial to investigate the effect of tiotropium on the FEV <sub>1 </sub> in patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【15】From October 2011 through September 2015, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 trial involving patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD. Patients were identified from community screening at 24 centers in mainland China <sup><a>12 </a></sup> and were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tiotropium (at a dose of 18 μg once daily) or matching placebo, administered by means of an inhaler (HandiHaler) once daily for 2 years. Randomization was centralized and conducted with the use of block sizes of four, stratified according to trial site.\n\n【16】The primary end point was the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use. Secondary end points included the following: between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use; the FVC before and after bronchodilator use at 24 months from baseline; the annual declines in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> , the FEV <sub>1 </sub> as a percentage of the predicted value before and after bronchodilator use, and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC ratio from day 30 through month 24; the changes in the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score (scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), <sup><a>13 </a></sup> the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) score (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse clinical control), <sup><a>14 </a></sup> and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale score (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe breathlessness) from baseline to 24 months; the duration and severity of COPD exacerbations; the time to the first COPD exacerbation; and the use of rescue medications. Further details of the trial design have been published previously. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> The protocol is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The key inclusion criteria were an age of 40 to 85 years and a diagnosis of COPD of GOLD stage 1 or 2, defined as an FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC ratio of less than 0.70 after bronchodilator use plus respiratory symptoms, a history of exposure to risk factors (e.g., smoking, air pollution, biomass combustion), or both and an FEV <sub>1 </sub> of 50% or more of the predicted value, measured 20 minutes after the inhalation of 400 μg of albuterol (Ventolin, Glaxo Wellcome). <sup><a>15 </a></sup> Key exclusion criteria were a COPD exacerbation occurring in the 4 weeks before screening, large-airway disease (e.g., cancer), asthma, and severe systemic disease. <sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【19】Procedures\n----------\n\n【20】Follow-up was scheduled at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter. The data that were collected at each visit included symptom-score assessment, physical examination, adverse events, medication administration, exacerbation information, and smoking status. Laboratory assessments were conducted at baseline and at month 24.\n\n【21】Spirometric values were measured during individual visits (at screening and at months 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 25) at approximately the same time of day (within a 4-hour window) at each visit by the same trained technicians according to international standards. <sup><a>16 </a></sup> Spirometric values that were obtained before bronchodilator use were measured approximately 24 hours after the previous dose of tiotropium or placebo. Spirometry that was performed after bronchodilator use was conducted 20 minutes after the inhalation of 400 μg of albuterol. Short-acting bronchodilators were withheld for at least 6 hours before the next spirometry. The predicted FEV <sub>1 </sub> was derived with the use of reference values from the European Coal and Steel Community 1993 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> and by the application of conversion factors (0.95 in men and 0.93 in women). <sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【22】An acute exacerbation of COPD was defined as worsening of at least two major symptoms (cough, sputum volume, sputum purulence, wheezing, or dyspnea) that persisted for at least 48 hours, after the presence of cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or cardiac arrhythmia had been ruled out. <sup><a>19 </a></sup> Patients immediately contacted investigators in the case of worsening of respiratory symptoms. The duration, interval, severity, and management of acute exacerbations of COPD were recorded on diary cards and were adjudicated by investigators who graded the severity according to the following categories. A mild event was one that resulted in domiciliary management with COPD medications alone. A moderate event was one that resulted in an outpatient or emergency department visit and the modification of regimen, including antibiotic agents, oral glucocorticoids, or both. A severe event was one that resulted in hospitalization. Assessments of the mMRC dyspnea scale and quality of life (including the CAT and CCQ assessments) were completed at each visit. <sup><a>13,14</a></sup>\n\n【23】Long-term concomitant use of other maintenance medications for COPD such as bronchodilators was avoided throughout the trial, except for medications that were clinically necessary or that had been initiated before recruitment. Ipratropium was used as rescue medication if needed but was not intended for long-term use (patients were instructed to contact their trial investigator immediately to seek guidance regarding the use of rescue medication, verification of an acute COPD exacerbation, and initiation of treatment associated with the acute exacerbation). Rundo International Pharmaceutical Research and Development was convened to monitor the quality of and check adherence to the trial regimen.\n\n【24】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【25】The trial protocol was approved by the local institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site, according to the requirement of the Chinese guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. Statistical analyses were performed by employees of Rundo International Pharmaceutical Research and Development. The funding sources had no role in the design, data analysis, or interpretation of the results in this trial. The sponsor (Boehringer Ingelheim) was given the opportunity to review the manuscript for medical and scientific accuracy as it related to its product (tiotropium) and intellectual property considerations. Albuterol was purchased at full cost. The first and last authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses reported and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. All the authors approved the submission of the manuscript for publication.\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】We calculated the sample size to detect a difference in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use between the tiotropium group and the placebo group, assuming a difference of 100 ml and a standard deviation of 350 ml at month 24, with a two-sided significance level of 5% and a power of 90%, taking into account an anticipated withdrawal rate of 35%. <sup><a>7,9 </a></sup> We estimated that a total of 400 patients per group would be required for the primary analysis.\n\n【28】Confirmatory hypothesis testing was planned only for the primary end point. All the secondary and subgroup analyses are exploratory in nature and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before and after bronchodilator use at each visit, with values at each follow-up visit as a dependent variable, with the trial-group assignment, baseline FEV <sub>1 </sub> values, follow-up visits (categorical variable), interactions between trial group and follow-up visit, and hospital as fixed effects and with participants as random effects. Assuming that trial-group effects varied linearly with the duration of the trial, a random coefficient regression model was used to compare the annual declines in FEV <sub>1 </sub> , FVC, and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC ratio, with the annual declines being expressed as regression coefficients. We used likelihood-based methods to handle missing data for the repeated-measures model and the random-coefficient model. No imputation was deemed to be necessary.\n\n【29】The time to the first acute exacerbation of COPD was compared by means of a log-rank test. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to assess the interval, duration, and severity of acute exacerbations of COPD. Fisher’s exact test was used for the comparison of differences in the use of rescue medication. The frequency and number of severe acute exacerbations of COPD were compared with the use of a Poisson regression model, with correction for exposure of trial-regimen doses and overdispersion (i.e., presence of greater variability in the data set than the expected heterogeneity in exacerbation rates). Transfer tables were used for the comparison of changes in the mMRC dyspnea scale scores between baseline and the end of the trial. Differences between the changes from baseline to the end of the trial were compared with the use of repeated-measures ANOVA. Subgroup analyses were performed with the use of stratification of COPD according to CAT score (<10 vs. ≥10) and GOLD stage (1 vs. 2) and category (A vs. B). Patients with A or B category disease are considered to be at low risk for an acute exacerbation of COPD; patients with A category disease have few symptoms, and those with B category disease have more symptoms.\n\n【30】The data from patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of tiotropium or placebo and had available data regarding efficacy measurement after baseline (i.e., patients who underwent spirometric assessment after bronchodilator use at any scheduled follow-up visit) were included in the full analysis set. The number of exacerbations in each trial group was reported. All the analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.2.2 (SAS Institute), and all reported P values are two-sided.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Baseline Demographic Characteristics and Adherence to Trial Regimen\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Randomization and Follow-up of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) of GOLD Stage 1 or 2.\n\n【34】Reasons for discontinuation of the trial did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 140 patients (33.2%) in the placebo group withdrew, as did 116 (27.7%) in the tiotropium group (P=0.27). Patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of tiotropium or placebo and had available data regarding efficacy measurement after baseline (i.e., patients who underwent spirometric assessment after bronchodilator use at any scheduled follow-up visit) were included in the full analysis set.\n\n【35】We randomly assigned 841 patients with COPD (367 patients with GOLD stage 1 disease and 474 with stage 2) to receive placebo (422 patients) or tiotropium (419) ( Figure 1 ). Among 771 patients who were included in the full analysis set (383 patients in the placebo group and 388 in the tiotropium group), 585 completed the follow-up visits for 2 years. A total of 256 patients withdrew from the trial (140 patients \\[33.2%\\] in the placebo group and 116 \\[27.7%\\] in the tiotropium group). There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics or in the reasons for withdrawal ( Figure 1 , and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the patients who withdrew and those who did not withdraw, except for the mean (±SD) CCQ score (1.09±0.79 in patients who withdrew vs. 0.94±0.71 in those who completed the trial, P=0.008) and the CAT score (6.9±5.8 vs. 7.8±6.3, P=0.03) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【36】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline (Full Analysis Set).\n\n【37】The baseline values of the patients in the full analysis set were similar in the two groups. The mean age of the patients was 63.9 years in the placebo group and 64.2 years in the tiotropium group, and the median smoking index (the number of packs of cigarettes per day, multiplied by the years of smoking) was 55.1 pack-years and 50.6 pack-years, respectively. The mean FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use was 1.82 liters (73.4% of the predicted value) in the placebo group and 1.80 liters (72.6% of the predicted value) in the tiotropium group; the mean FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was 1.94 liters (78.1% of the predicted value) and 1.93 liters (77.9% of the predicted value), respectively. No significant between-group differences were observed in the mMRC dyspnea scale, CAT, or CCQ scores and in the use of concomitant respiratory medications ( Table 1 ).\n\n【38】The mean exposure to the trial regimen was 604 days in the placebo group (adherence rate, 90.5%) and 638 days in the tiotropium group (adherence rate, 93.3%) (P=0.009 for the comparison of mean exposure; P=0.004 for the comparison of adherence rate). The number of times of administration and the number of days of rescue-medication use were greater in the placebo group than in the tiotropium group (P=0.002 and P=0.02, respectively). There was no significant between-group difference with regard to smoking status or the use of other respiratory medications (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【39】Lung Function\n-------------\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) before and after Bronchodilator Use and the Risk of Acute Exacerbation of COPD over Time.\n\n【41】Tiotropium resulted in a significantly higher FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use than placebo at 24 months, with a between-group difference of 157 ml (95% CI, 123 to 192; P<0.001), and at each visit (ranges of mean differences, 127 to 169 ml in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use and 71 to 133 ml in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use; P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Panel A). The FVC was significantly higher in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group (ranges of mean differences, 110 to 164 ml in the FVC before bronchodilator use and 53 to 96 ml in the FVC after bronchodilator use; P<0.05 for all comparisons) (Panel B). I bars indicate ±1 SD. The use of tiotropium resulted in a significantly longer time to the first acute exacerbation of COPD (25th percentile, 522 days; 95% CI, 341 to 649) than placebo (25th percentile, 236 days; 95% CI, 177 to 331). The incidence of an acute exacerbation of COPD was lower with tiotropium than with placebo (Panel C).\n\n【42】Tiotropium resulted in a significantly higher FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use than placebo at month 24, with a between-group difference of 157 ml (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 123 to 192; P<0.001) ( Figure 2 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). At each visit, both the mean FEV <sub>1 </sub> (ranges of mean differences, 127 to 169 ml before bronchodilator use and 71 and 133 ml after bronchodilator use) and the mean FVC (ranges of mean differences, 110 to 164 ml before bronchodilator use and 53 to 96 ml after bronchodilator use) were significantly higher in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons of FEV <sub>1 </sub> and P<0.05 for all comparisons of FVC at follow-up visits to month 24) ( Figure 2 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Annual Declines in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> , FVC, Percent of Predicted FEV <sub>1 </sub> , Percent of Predicted FVC, and FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC Ratio before and after Bronchodilator Use.\n\n【44】From day 30 through month 24, the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use was 38 ml per year in the tiotropium group and 53 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 15 ml per year; 95% CI, −1 to 31; P=0.06), whereas the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was 29 ml per year in the tiotropium group versus 51 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 22 ml per year; 95% CI, 6 to 37; P=0.006). Similar findings were observed for the between-group differences in the percent of the predicted FEV <sub>1 </sub> value and in the analyses after adjustment for smoking status, the percent of the predicted FEV <sub>1 </sub> value at baseline, age, sex, hospitalization, GOLD stage, and body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters). The groups did not differ significantly in the FVC, the percent of the predicted FVC value, and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC ratio as assessed before and after bronchodilator use ( Table 2 ).\n\n【45】Acute Exacerbations of COPD\n---------------------------\n\n【46】A total of 112 patients (28.9%) in the tiotropium group and 150 (39.2%) in the placebo group had an acute exacerbation of COPD. The time to the first acute exacerbation of COPD was longer with tiotropium than with placebo (P<0.001). The 25th-percentile value for the time to the first acute exacerbation of COPD was 522 days (95% CI, 341 to 649) in the tiotropium group and 236 days (95% CI, 177 to 331) in the placebo group. The hazard ratio for the first acute exacerbation of COPD in the tiotropium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.80; P<0.001) ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【47】Table 3.  Table 3. Acute Exacerbations of COPD and Hospitalizations Due to COPD.\n\n【48】The frequency of acute exacerbations of COPD was lower with tiotropium than with placebo (0.27 vs. 0.50 events per patient-year; risk ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.73; P<0.001) ( Table 3 ). Tiotropium also resulted in a lower frequency of hospitalizations per patient per year than placebo (0.03 vs. 0.07 hospitalizations per patient-year, P=0.009) ( Table 3 ).\n\n【49】Quality of Life\n---------------\n\n【50】Tiotropium was more effective than placebo with regard to mMRC dyspnea scale and CAT scores at all time points except for months 1, 3, and 12. Changes in the CCQ scores also favored tiotropium over placebo at all visits except for month 12. Details are provided in Tables S5, S6, and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【51】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【52】There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and death except for mild adverse events, such as oropharyngeal discomfort. Oropharyngeal discomfort, including dry mouth and pharyngeal discomfort, occurred in 63 patients (15.0%) in the tiotropium group, as compared with 28 (6.6%) in the placebo group (P<0.001) (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【53】Subgroup Analysis\n-----------------\n\n【54】In this trial, 614 of 841 patients (73.0%) had a CAT score of less than 10, and no significant between-group difference was observed with regard to baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure to the trial regimen, use of other respiratory medication, or smoking status except for the number of times that rescue medication (ipratropium) was administered (Tables S9 and S10 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Data on the FEV <sub>1 </sub> and FVC values before and after bronchodilator use at individual visits, stratified according to CAT score, are provided in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix . In patients with a CAT score of less than 10, the mean decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use was 54 ml per year in the placebo group and 37 ml per year in the tiotropium group, with a difference in the annual decline of 17 ml per year (95% CI, −1 to 35; P=0.07). The mean decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was 47 ml per year in the placebo group and 28 ml per year in the tiotropium group, with a difference in the annual decline of 20 ml per year (95% CI, 2 to 37; P=0.03) ( Table 2 ). In patients with a CAT score of 10 or more, the between-group difference in the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was not significant (P=0.07) ( Table 2 ).\n\n【55】Tiotropium prolonged the time to the first acute exacerbation of COPD and decreased the total numbers of all acute exacerbations of COPD and of acute exacerbations of moderate or worse severity in patients with a CAT score of less than 10. In patients with a CAT score of less than 10, the mMRC dyspnea scale score and quality-of-life assessment scores were lower (indicating clinical improvement) in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group at months 15, 21, and 24. Details are provided in Tables S12 through S16 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【56】Subgroup analyses that were stratified according to GOLD stage and category (1 vs. 2 and A vs. B) showed results that were similar to those in the overall analysis. Details are provided in Tables S17 through S23 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【57】Discussion\n----------\n\n【58】We investigated the efficacy and safety of tiotropium in a large cohort of patients who had GOLD stage 1 or stage 2 COPD. Tiotropium resulted in a significantly higher FEV <sub>1 </sub> than placebo at 24 months and ameliorated the annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> assessed after bronchodilator use but not the FEV <sub>1 </sub> assessed before bronchodilator use. Moreover, tiotropium resulted in a lower frequency of acute exacerbations of COPD than placebo and improved quality of life in patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD. Similar results were found in patients who had a CAT score of less than 10.\n\n【59】Clinical trials with medication intervention in patients with GOLD stage 1 COPD or a CAT score of less than 10 are scarce, with some data available from post hoc subgroup analyses. <sup><a>9,11,20 </a></sup> Our multicenter trial involved patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD and enrolled more than 40% of patients with stage 1 disease and more than 70% of patients with a CAT score of less than 10, mainly from the community by means of a COPD screening program. At baseline, the majority of patients had a low frequency of acute exacerbations of COPD and had received minimal medications.\n\n【60】Attempts to decrease the progression rate of COPD with tiotropium have not been fully successful. In a subgroup analysis of the Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) trial, tiotropium resulted in an annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use in patients with GOLD stage 2 COPD that was less than the decline in patients who received placebo. However, the mean between-group differences were small and not clinically significant (6 ml per year). <sup><a>9 </a></sup> In our trial, we recruited only patients with mild or moderate COPD, which might have contributed to the differences in findings between the two trials. Previous reports have shown that in previously untreated patients with COPD, tiotropium led to an annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> that was slower than that with placebo. <sup><a>20 </a></sup> In another study involving patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use was significantly greater after 12 weeks of tiotropium than after placebo, which suggests that tiotropium might be effective for mild COPD. <sup><a>10 </a></sup> However, in a real-world retrospective cohort study involving patients with early-stage COPD (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ≥70% of the predicted value), tiotropium did not lead to a significantly slower decline than placebo in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> (decline in FEV <sub>1 </sub> before bronchodilator use, 30.4 ml per year in the tiotropium group and 21.9 ml per year in the placebo group; decline in FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use, 23.9 ml per year and 22.5 ml per year, respectively). <sup><a>21 </a></sup> This finding could be due to the retrospective study design and the small sample size.\n\n【61】The case definition for COPD that we used was an FEV <sub>1 </sub> :FVC ratio of less than 0.70 after bronchodilator use plus respiratory symptoms, a history of exposure to risk factors (e.g., smoking, air pollution, biomass combustion), or both. <sup><a>15,22,23 </a></sup> Patients with early-stage COPD remain asymptomatic but have a rapid decline in lung function. <sup><a>24-26 </a></sup> In our trial, all the participants met the diagnostic definition of COPD in terms of risk factors and spirometric results, and in patients with a CAT score of less than 10, tiotropium resulted in an annual decline in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use that was less than the decline observed with placebo. It is not known whether the prevention of COPD-related loss of lung function that was associated with tiotropium has any effect on the underlying disease mechanisms in COPD. If it does not, then the benefit that we observed may simply delay the development of more severe disease rather than prevent it.\n\n【62】The prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD has been listed explicitly as a cardinal goal for patients who have COPD of any grade of severity. <sup><a>15 </a></sup> Tiotropium resulted in a significantly lower frequency of acute COPD exacerbations than placebo, which reaffirms previous reports. <sup><a>7,9,20 </a></sup> Finally, our trial showed no remarkable differences with regard to side effects (e.g., cardiovascular effects, urinary tract disease) that have been associated with tiotropium as compared with placebo, except for dry mouth or pharyngeal discomfort.\n\n【63】In conclusion, this trial showed that tiotropium was effective in improving lung function and quality of life and resulted in a lower frequency of acute COPD exacerbations than placebo among patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 disease. Whether early intervention with tiotropium alters the long-term course of COPD remains an open question.\n\n【64】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【65】Supported in part by an investigator-initiated study program by Boehringer Ingelheim and by grants from the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the 12th and 13th National 5-Year Development Plan (2012BAI05B01 and 2016YFC1304101) and the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Research Department (2011B031800132).\n\n【66】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【67】No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\n\n【68】Drs.

The overall risk of endometrial carcinoma was six-fold for estrogen users as compared with nonusers; long-term users (> five years) had a 15-fold risk. Excess risk was present for both diethylstilbestrol and conjugated estrogens. The risk associated with cyclic use was as great as that for continuous use. Increased risk was associated with estrogen use for all histologic grades of the tumor. The risk of advanced-stage carcinoma was fourfold for estrogen users, but the confidence interval was wide, and this question requires further study.\n\n【2】Finally, this investigation contradicts the speculation that the association between this cancer and estrogen use can be explained by swifter diagnosis for estrogen users, misclassification of estrogen-related hyperplasia or treatment of early symptoms of the tumor with estrogen.

Sixty-six infants with germinal-matrix (periventricular) or intraventricular hemorrhage or both (cases) were matched with 254 infants with other conditions (controls), and analysis, taking the matching factors into account, yielded an odds ratio of 14.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 34).

The association did not appear to vary according to the severity of hemorrhage or to the method of administration or dose of heparin.\n\n【2】The data suggest that the routine use of heparin in neonatal intensive care units is associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage.

Figure 1. Number of Patients with Reactions to Gentamicin, According to the Dose.\n\n【3】Information on dosing was available for 141 patients.\n\n【4】In October 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 20 endotoxin-like reactions to intravenous gentamicin <sup><a>1 </a></sup> administered in a once-daily dosing regimen. We report on a completed investigation of a series of pyrogenic reactions involving two gentamicin products. The reactions were reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between May 1998 and December 1999. They involved 155 patients; 38 percent were male and 62 percent were female. Their mean age was 41 years (range, 3 to 85). Dosing information was available for 91 percent of the patients ( Figure 1 ). Eighty-one percent received once-daily dosing (70 percent at a dose of 5 to 7 mg per kilogram of body weight), and 10 percent received conventional dosing (3 mg per kilogram per day in three divided doses). Information on indications for use was available for 86 percent of the patients. Gentamicin was given to treat underlying infection in 50 percent, for fever and neutropenia in 22 percent, and as prophylaxis in 14 percent.\n\n【5】Reactions typically occurred within three hours after infusion of the drug (in 98 percent of the patients) and lasted for less than three hours (in 96 percent). Patients reported chills or shaking or shivering (75 percent), rigors (23 percent), fever (68 percent), tachycardia (17 percent), hypertension or hypotension (17 percent), and respiratory symptoms (47 percent). More serious reactions also occurred, including cyanosis (in 4 percent of the patients), oxygen saturation of less than 80 (in 7 percent), and pulmonary edema (in one patient). Eight percent of the patients had severe reactions leading to hospitalization (with intubation, resuscitation, or admission to the intensive care unit in five cases). None of the cases were fatal.\n\n【6】The use of a once-daily dosing regimen of gentamicin started in the early 1990s as a way to minimize toxicity and simplify administration. <sup><a>2,3 </a></sup> A recent survey indicates that approximately 75 percent of hospitals use once-daily dosing, <sup><a>4 </a></sup> as compared with 19 percent in 1994. <sup><a>5 </a></sup> This dosing regimen is considered “off-label” because it has not been subject to the FDA's scientific review and is therefore not included in the product labeling. United States Pharmacopeia standards for allowable concentrations of inactive ingredients and impurities in gentamicin products are based on conventional dosing. Use of once-daily dosing therefore results in increased exposure per dose to these other constituents. For example, endotoxin levels in drug products are set so that the patient's exposure per hour is below the threshold level of exposure for a febrile response (i.e., 5 endotoxin units per kilogram per hour, or 1.7 endotoxin units per milligram of gentamicin given as a conventional dose).\n\n【7】These reactions were initially thought to be due to the exposure of patients to higher endotoxin levels with once-daily dosing than with conventional dosing. An FDA investigation revealed that 10 percent of gentamicin lots tested had elevated endotoxin levels (>1.7 endotoxin units per milligram), and an additional 4 percent of the lots would have exposed a patient to levels above the acceptable threshold with once-daily dosing. The two products implicated in these clusters involved the same supplier of bulk gentamicin. Inspection of the bulk supplier revealed inadequacies in manufacturing practices that led to an increase in the overall impurities. The FDA ordered a ban on the import of products from this firm in September 1999. Gentamicin made with a new bulk-drug supply has been uneventfully reintroduced to the market.\n\n【8】The reporting of these adverse events by diligent health care professionals led to the identification, investigation, and withdrawal of these products by the FDA. Health care professionals are encouraged to report adverse events to manufacturers and directly to the FDA through the MedWatch program at 1-800-332-1088 (or at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . opens in new tab ).\n\n【9】(The views represented in this letter are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Food and Drug Administration.)\n\n【10】Mary M.

More than 40 million people filed for unemployment insurance between March and May 2020, and official statistics may understate the true extent of job disruptions. Widespread layoffs amid the pandemic threaten to cut off millions of people from their employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Concurrently, health insurance has increased in importance because of the need for coverage of Covid-19 diagnostic testing and treatment. As restrictions are lifted and the economy begins its slow recovery, some people who had been laid off will be able to reclaim their jobs and health benefits. But the economy is unlikely to recover to prepandemic levels in the near future, meaning that the Covid-associated recession will leave many people without jobs and without their usual source of health insurance.\n\n【3】Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, people who lost their jobs had limited choices for health insurance. Newly disabled people could apply for Medicaid if their savings and assets were low enough for them to qualify for Supplemental Security Income, or they could enroll in Medicare after receiving 2 years of benefits from Social Security Disability Insurance. For adults without a disability, many states’ income cutoffs for Medicaid were well below the poverty line, and only people with dependent children could apply. An individual private-insurance market existed, but without insurer regulations — such as guaranteed issue, community rating, actuarial-value standards, and coverage of essential health benefits — plans were skimpy, excluded people with preexisting conditions, and were often unaffordable. Married people who lost their jobs could potentially switch to their partner’s employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) plan. Finally, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, known as COBRA, allowed former employees and their dependents to temporarily continue their enrollment in employer-based insurance. Former employees who opt for COBRA coverage must pay 102% of the full premium cost (the employee plus employer shares), however, which has led to very low levels of take-up.\n\n【4】The ACA, having created several new options for health insurance unrelated to employment, will protect many recently unemployed people and their families from losing coverage. In the 36 states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs, expansion removed asset tests and categorical eligibility requirements (for example, policies that required enrollees to be disabled, pregnant, or parents of dependent children) and extended eligibility to all U.S. citizens and qualifying documented immigrants with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. Many newly displaced workers will therefore be able to apply for Medicaid. Under another ACA provision, young adults can stay or go back on their parents’ plans as dependents through 26 years of age. And by establishing health insurance marketplaces supported by consumer protections and premium tax credits, the law has allowed people to shop directly for subsidized, comprehensive coverage.\n\n【5】To quantify the ACA’s effect on changes in health insurance coverage after job loss, we used national data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to compare the trajectories of nonelderly adults who lost their jobs before 2014 — the year the law’s Medicaid and marketplace provisions went into full effect — with the trajectories of those who lost their jobs in 2014 or later. The sample included adults 19 to 64 years of age who were employed at the beginning of the 2-year longitudinal survey but had left or lost their jobs by the end of it. We examined the insurance status of these participants during the first 3 months and the last 3 months that they were surveyed.\n\n【6】 Pre- and Post-ACA Health Insurance Coverage among Nonelderly Adults with Job Loss.\n\n【7】Bold type indicates a differences-in-differences estimate that is significant at P<0.05 (see the Supplementary Appendix for details). Data are from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2011–2016. The sample included all adults 19 to 64 years of age who had any employment in the first round of the survey but had become unemployed by the final round (pre-ACA, N=1350; post-ACA, N=1103). Participants were interviewed in five rounds over 2 years. The mean age of the full population-weighted cohort was 39.7 years, and 57.5% of participants were female, 13.5% were Black, and 17.7% were Hispanic. Insurance types were mutually exclusive and were defined according to the following hierarchy: (1) employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), (2) Medicaid, (3) marketplace or nongroup insurance, (4) Medicare or other, and (5) uninsured. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. CI denotes confidence interval.\n\n【8】Between 2011 and 2013, job loss was associated with an average coverage loss of 4.6 percentage points; the proportion of participants with any coverage decreased from 66.3% to 61.7% (see figure ). This overall reduction in coverage was caused by a 12.8 percentage point reduction in ESI that was only partially offset by higher rates of Medicaid and nongroup coverage after losing a job. In the post-ACA period, the overall coverage rate in this population was much higher to begin with (76.2%) — reflecting the additional coverage options available through Medicaid and the marketplaces established under the ACA — and job loss was no longer linked to an increase in the uninsured rate. Large gains in Medicaid (8.9 percentage points) and marketplace coverage (2.6 percentage points) nearly fully offset the reduction in ESI for people who left or lost their jobs. Overall, there was a 6.0 percentage point net reduction in loss of coverage after a job loss in the post-ACA period as compared with the pre-ACA period (see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). These results indicate the critical role that the ACA will play in alleviating coverage losses related to the Covid-associated recession, in keeping with findings from other recent reports. <sup><a>1,2 </a></sup> Data from early 2020 show that enrollment in marketplace plans and Medicaid is already rising. <sup><a>3 </a></sup> The ACA’s effects would most likely dwarf the emergency measures that are under consideration in Congress to protect people who are laid off from losing their health insurance, such as subsidizing COBRA coverage.\n\n【9】During the pandemic, job loss has been concentrated among Hispanic and Black workers and workers in service industries. The country’s attention to structural racism has intensified in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and subsequent protests. In this context, it’s important to acknowledge the key role that the ACA has played in reducing racial disparities in health insurance coverage. In our analysis, the ACA’s protective effects against becoming uninsured after a job loss were largest for Black people (a 7.0 percentage point reduction in loss of coverage) and Hispanic people (a 13.9 percentage point reduction).\n\n【10】Even with the ACA, gaps in insurance coverage remain. Fourteen states have not yet expanded their Medicaid programs, despite evidence of the economic and public health benefits of expansion. <sup><a>4 </a></sup> Several states have approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to add work requirements to their programs, even though the current recession undercuts a key argument commonly made in favor of work requirements: that reliance on public welfare programs is the major barrier to employment. Other persistent gaps include a lack of coverage options for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for public programs or marketplace subsidies. Finally, for people in many occupations — especially blue-collar, seasonal, and part-time workers — employment was hardly a guarantee of coverage to begin with, though these groups have benefited the most from the ACA’s coverage expansion. <sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【11】The Families First Coronavirus Response Act increased the federal government’s share of Medicaid costs for the duration of the Covid-19 emergency, and it prevents states from cutting eligibility. Additional policies that could help people who lose their jobs include boosting incentives offered to states that haven’t expanded their Medicaid programs, authorizing a special enrollment period related to the Covid-associated recession to permit people to purchase marketplace coverage outside standard enrollment periods, and using unemployment insurance itself as a mechanism for auto-enrolling people in Medicaid. <sup><a>2,3</a></sup>\n\n【12】While policymakers work to close these remaining gaps, it’s imperative that other gaps not be reopened. The ACA’s fate will again hang in the balance when the U.S. Supreme Court considers the law’s constitutionality in _California v. Texas_ . This newest challenge comes from a contingent of 18 Republican state attorneys general who argue that the individual mandate, which was ruled unconstitutional in the lower courts after the associated tax penalty was zeroed out, is not severable from the rest of the law, and therefore the entire law is unconstitutional. The Trump administration filed a brief in support of striking down the law, and President Donald Trump recently reiterated his desire to “terminate” the ACA.\n\n【13】In the current context of millions of Americans losing their jobs and an ongoing pandemic, overturning the ACA would most likely be devastating to patients, clinicians, hospitals, and state economies. The very virus that has brought about record unemployment levels is the same agent that makes health insurance — and the new options created under the ACA — more important than ever.\n\n【14】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\n\n【16】This article was published on August 19, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【18】From the Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (S.D.A., B.D.S.), the Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.H.

Additional data were needed regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of this vaccine in a larger population.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was virologically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically negative at baseline.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed an efficacy of 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.5) against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020-004123-16 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nNVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine  \n_02:30_\n\n【13】More than a year after its emergence as a global pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with more than 177 million cases resulting in more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide as of June 21, 2021. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> To control this pandemic, efforts were accelerated to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the spike glycoprotein of the prototype strain. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> By early 2021, several vaccine candidates had emerged as safe and effective in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), findings that supported the emergency use of these vaccines around the world. <sup><a>3-6</a></sup>\n\n【14】In late 2020, reports from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa confirmed the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants — B.1.1.7 (or alpha), P.1 (or gamma), and B.1.351 (or beta), respectively — that have been associated with increased transmission, more severe disease, and varying degrees of immune avoidance to Covid-19 vaccines. <sup><a>7-9 </a></sup> In the United Kingdom, the B.1.1.7 variant was identified from genomic sequencing of samples obtained from patients with Covid-19 in the southeast of England in early October 2020. During December 2020, this new variant spread from the southeast region to London and the rest of the country. Subsequently, the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant has been increasing rapidly in Europe and the United States. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> These new variants may threaten our current attempts at controlling Covid-19 and lead to additional health and socioeconomic consequences.\n\n【15】Early clinical data from studies of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (Novavax), which consists of 5 μg of a recombinant nanoparticle spike protein plus 50 μg of Matrix-M adjuvant, have shown that a two-dose regimen administered 21 days apart was safe and associated with a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. <sup><a>10,11 </a></sup> Here, we present data from the 2019nCoV-302 study, a phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in preventing Covid-19 in participants between the ages of 18 and 84 years in the United Kingdom. This ongoing trial was initiated during the period in which the B.1.1.7 variant was starting to circulate more widely.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Participants\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】From September 28 to November 28, 2020, we enrolled participants at 33 sites in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants were men and nonpregnant women between the ages of 18 and 84 years who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus infection (for which they were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy) and cardiac and respiratory diseases. Key exclusion criteria were a history of documented Covid-19, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or a diagnosis of an immunodeficient condition. The protocol containing the statistical analysis plan is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All the participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【19】Oversight\n---------\n\n【20】The trial was designed and funded by Novavax, the manufacturer of NVX-CoV2373. The trial protocol was approved by the North West–Greater Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee. The trial was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation. (Details regarding trial oversight are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.) All data were gathered by the non-Novavax authors (representing each trial site) and their teams; all the analyses were performed by representatives of Novavax. Confidentiality agreements were in place between all the authors and the trial sponsor. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author with subsequent contributions from all the authors. Editorial assistance in the preparation of the manuscript was provided by Phase Five Communications and funded by Novavax. All trial data were available to all the authors. Safety oversight for specific rules regarding a pause in vaccination was performed by an independent safety monitoring committee. All the authors assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【21】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【22】Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (normal saline) administered 21 days apart by means of a centralized interactive-response system, according to a pregenerated randomization schedule. Randomization was stratified according to trial site and age (<65 years or ≥65 years). In a 400-person subgroup, participants received a concomitant dose of seasonal influenza vaccine along with the first dose of NVX-CoV2373. Results of this subgroup analysis, along with immunogenicity data from the current trial, are not reported here.\n\n【23】Because this was an observer-blinded trial, site personnel who were aware of trial-group assignments managed the logistics and preparation of the trial vaccines but were not involved in trial-related assessments and did not have contact with the participants for data collection after vaccine administration.\n\n【24】Safety\n------\n\n【25】Safety was assessed in all the participants who had received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo. Solicited local and systemic adverse events were summarized according to the toxicity grading criteria of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Appendix 4 in the protocol ) and the time period after each injection. Unsolicited adverse events were coded according to the preferred terms and system organ classes in the _Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities_ , version 23.1, and summarized according to severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and the assessed relationship to the vaccine. (Details are provided in Section 6.4.1.4 in the protocol .)\n\n【26】After each injection, participants were observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for any acute reactions. Solicited local and systemic adverse events were collected by means of an electronic diary for 7 days after each dose in a subgroup of participants (solicited adverse event subgroup). All the participants were assessed for unsolicited adverse events from the first dose through 28 days after the second dose. In this ongoing study, we are evaluating serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and medically attended adverse events from the first dose through 1 year after the second dose.\n\n【27】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【28】The primary end point was the efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine against the first occurrence of virologically confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants who were seronegative at baseline, as determined by the results of testing for anti–nucleocapsid antibody. Symptomatic Covid-19 was defined according to the criteria of the FDA.\n\n【29】The severity of Covid-19 cases was determined in a blinded fashion on the basis of a prespecified, automated algorithm. This algorithm synthesized data points (e.g., symptom diary entries, emergency department and hospitalization records, findings on physical examination, and vital signs) collected throughout the trial to assign severity on the basis of the FDA criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Symptoms of suspected Covid-19 were monitored throughout the trial and collected with the use of an electronic diary (the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome questionnaire) for at least 10 days. At the onset of suspected symptoms, respiratory specimens from the nose and throat were collected daily over a 3-day period to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a clinical assessment was performed. Virologic confirmation was performed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay at the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care laboratories with the TaqPath system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were not available for sequencing, and virus-strain characterization was based on PCR data alone. <sup><a>12 </a></sup> Results were described as being S-gene negative (or having S-gene target failure) if the PCR target of the spike-protein gene was not detected but other PCR targets (i.e., N and ORF1ab genes) were detected; such results were presumed to indicate the presence of B.1.1.7 variants. (Details regarding these analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .)\n\n【30】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【31】We determined that the enrollment of approximately 15,000 participants (resulting in a total number of 100 mild, moderate, or severe cases of Covid-19) would provide an overall power of more than 95% to determine a vaccine efficacy of 70% or more. A single interim analysis of efficacy was to be conducted after the identification of approximately 50% of the total anticipated primary end points (50 events) with the use of Pocock stopping boundaries. The main hypothesis-testing, event-driven interim and final analyses of the primary end point were performed at an overall one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 for the primary end point.\n\n【32】The primary end point was analyzed in the per-protocol efficacy population, which consisted of the participants who were seronegative at baseline, had received both doses of trial vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary end point, and had no confirmed cases of symptomatic Covid-19 during the period from the first dose until 6 days after the second dose. We also performed an intention-to-treat analysis, which included all the participants who had undergone randomization and had received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Vaccine efficacy was defined as VE (%)=(1–RR)×100, in which RR is the relative risk of incidence between the two trial groups. Mean values for disease occurrence are reported as the incidence per year per 1000 participants. The estimated relative risk and its confidence interval were calculated with the use of Poisson regression with robust error variance. <sup><a>13 </a></sup> Hypothesis testing of the primary end point was performed against the null hypothesis of a vaccine efficacy of 30% or less. The success criterion required rejection of the null hypothesis to show a vaccine efficacy that met the criteria for statistical significance. All other efficacy end points were analyzed by means of the same method that was used for determining the primary efficacy end point without adjustment for multiple comparisons (i.e., at a two-sided alpha of 0.05).\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Participants\n------------\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.\n\n【36】The full analysis set (safety population) included all the participants who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine or placebo, regardless of protocol violations or missing data. The primary end point was analyzed in the per-protocol population, which included participants who were seronegative at baseline, had received both doses of trial vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary end point, and had no confirmed cases of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during the period from the first dose until 6 days after the second dose.\n\n【37】Of the 16,645 participants who were screened, 15,187 underwent randomization ( Figure 1 ). A total of 15,139 participants received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 (7569 participants) or placebo (7570 participants); 14,039 participants (7020 in the vaccine group and 7019 in the placebo group) met the criteria for the per-protocol efficacy population.\n\n【38】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline (Per-Protocol Efficacy Population).\n\n【39】The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants at baseline were well balanced between the groups in the per-protocol efficacy population, in which 48.4% were women; 94.5% were White, 2.9% were Asian, and 0.4% were Black. A total of 44.6% of the participants had at least one coexisting condition that had been defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a risk factor for severe Covid-19. These conditions included chronic respiratory, cardiac, renal, neurologic, hepatic, and immunocompromising conditions as well as obesity. <sup><a>14 </a></sup> The median age was 56 years, and 27.9% of the participants were 65 years of age or older ( Table 1 ).\n\n【40】Safety\n------\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events.\n\n【42】The percentage of participants who had solicited local and systemic adverse events during the 7 days after each injection of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine or placebo is plotted according to the maximum toxicity grade (mild, moderate, severe, or potentially life-threatening). Data are not included for the 400 trial participants who were also enrolled in the seasonal influenza vaccine substudy.\n\n【43】A total of 2310 participants were included in the subgroup in which adverse events were solicited. Solicited local adverse events were reported more frequently in the vaccine group than in the placebo group after both the first dose (57.6% vs. 17.9%) and the second dose (79.6% vs. 16.4%) ( Figure 2 ). Among the vaccine recipients, the most commonly reported local adverse events were injection-site tenderness or pain after both the first dose (with 53.3% reporting tenderness and 29.3% reporting pain) and the second dose (76.4% and 51.2%, respectively), with most events being grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) in severity and of a short mean duration (2.3 days of tenderness and 1.7 days of pain after the first dose and 2.8 and 2.2 days, respectively, after the second dose). Solicited local adverse events were reported more frequently among younger vaccine recipients (18 to 64 years of age) than among older recipients (≥65 years).\n\n【44】Solicited systemic adverse events were reportedly more frequently in the vaccine group than in the placebo group after both the first dose (45.7% vs. 36.3%) and the second dose (64.0% vs. 30.0%) ( Figure 2 ). Among the vaccine recipients, the most commonly reported systemic adverse events were headache, muscle pain, and fatigue after both the first dose (24.5%, 21.4%, and 19.4%, respectively) and the second dose (40.0%, 40.3%, and 40.3%, respectively), with most events being grade 1 or 2 in severity and of a short mean duration (1.6, 1.6, and 1.8 days, respectively, after the first dose and 2.0, 1.8, and 1.9 days, respectively, after the second dose). Grade 4 systemic adverse events were reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Two participants reported a grade 4 fever (>40 °C), one after the first dose and the other after the second dose. A third participant was found to have had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR assay at baseline. Five days after dose 1, this participant was hospitalized for Covid-19 symptoms and subsequently had six grade 4 events: nausea, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, and joint pain. Systemic adverse events were reported more often by younger vaccine recipients than by older vaccine recipients and more often after the second dose than after the first dose. Among the vaccine recipients, fever (temperature, ≥38°C) was reported in 2.0% after the first dose and in 4.8% after the second dose. Grade 3 fever (39°C to 40°C) was reported in 0.4% after the first dose and in 0.6% after the second dose; grade 4 fever (>40°C) was reported in 2 participants, with one event after the first dose and one after the second dose.\n\n【45】All 15,139 participants who had received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo through the data cutoff date of the final efficacy analysis were assessed for unsolicited adverse events. The frequency of unsolicited adverse events was higher among vaccine recipients than among placebo recipients (25.3% vs. 20.5%), with similar frequencies of severe adverse events (1.0% vs. 0.8%), serious adverse events (0.5% vs. 0.5%), medically attended adverse events (3.8% vs. 3.9%), adverse events leading to discontinuation of dosing (0.3% vs. 0.3%) or participation in the trial (0.2% vs. 0.2%), potential immune-mediated medical conditions (<0.1% vs. <0.1%), and adverse events of special interest relevant to Covid-19 (0.1% vs. 0.3%). One related serious adverse event (myocarditis) was reported in a vaccine recipient, which occurred 3 days after the second dose and was considered to be a potentially immune-mediated condition; an independent safety monitoring committee considered the event most likely to be viral myocarditis. The participant had a full recovery after 2 days of hospitalization. No episodes of anaphylaxis or vaccine-associated enhanced Covid-19 were reported.\n\n【46】Two deaths related to Covid-19 were reported, one in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. The death in the vaccine group occurred in a 53-year-old man in whom Covid-19 symptoms developed 7 days after the first dose; he was subsequently admitted to the ICU for treatment of respiratory failure from Covid-19 pneumonia and died 15 days after vaccine administration. The death in the placebo group occurred in a 61-year-old man who was hospitalized 24 days after the first dose; the participant died 4 weeks later after complications from Covid-19 pneumonia and sepsis.\n\n【47】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【48】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Plots of Efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 Vaccine against Symptomatic Covid-19.\n\n【49】Shown is the cumulative incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 in the per-protocol population (Panel A), the intention-to-treat population (Panel B), and the per-protocol population with the B.1.1.7 variant (Panel C). The timing of surveillance for symptomatic Covid-19 began after the first dose in the intention-to-treat population and at least 7 days after the administration of the second dose in the per-protocol population (i.e., on day 28) through approximately the first 3 months of follow-up.Figure 4.  Figure 4. Vaccine Efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 in Specific Subgroups.\n\n【50】Shown is the efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups within the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals were derived with the use of Poisson regression with robust error variance. In the intention-to-treat population, vaccine efficacy was assessed after the administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo. Participants who identified themselves as being non-White or belonging to multiple races were pooled in a category of “other” race to ensure that the subpopulations would be large enough for meaningful analyses. Data regarding coexisting conditions were based on the definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for persons who are at increased risk for Covid-19.\n\n【51】Among the 14,039 participants in the per-protocol efficacy population, cases of virologically confirmed, symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19 with an onset at least 7 days after the second dose occurred in 10 vaccine recipients (6.53 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 3.32 to 12.85) and in 96 placebo recipients (63.43 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 45.19 to 89.03), for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% (95% CI, 80.2 to 94.6) ( Figure 3 ). Of the 10 vaccine breakthrough cases, 8 were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant, 1 was caused by a non-B.1.1.7 variant, and 1 viral strain could not be identified. Ten cases of mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19 (1 in the vaccine group and 9 in the placebo group) were reported in participants who were 65 years of age or older ( Figure 4 ). Severe Covid-19 occurred in 5 participants, all in the placebo group. Among these cases, 1 patient was hospitalized and 3 visited the emergency department; a fifth participant was cared for at home. All 5 patients met additional criteria regarding abnormal vital signs, use of supplemental oxygen, and Covid-19 complications that were used to define severity (Table S1). No hospitalizations or deaths from Covid-19 occurred among the vaccine recipients in the per-protocol efficacy analysis.\n\n【52】Additional efficacy analyses in subgroups (defined according to age, race, and presence or absence of coexisting conditions) are detailed in Figure 4 . Among the participants who were 65 years of age or older, overall vaccine efficacy was 88.9% (95% CI, 12.8 to 98.6); efficacy among all the participants starting 14 days after the first dose was 83.4% (95% CI, 73.6 to 89.5). A post hoc analysis of the primary end point identified the B.1.1.7 variant in 66 participants and a non-B.1.1.7 variant in 29 participants; in 11 participants, PCR testing had been performed at a local hospital laboratory in which the variant had not been identified. Vaccine efficacy was 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 variant and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.4) against non-B.1.1.7 strains. Too few non-White participants were enrolled in the trial to draw meaningful conclusions about variations in efficacy on the basis of race or ethnic group.\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered 21 days apart was found to be safe and 89.7% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 caused by both B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 variants. The timing of accumulated cases in this trial allowed for a post hoc assessment of vaccine efficacy against strains that included the B.1.1.7 variant, which is now circulating widely outside the United Kingdom and was the most widespread strain reported in the United States at the time of this report <sup><a>15 </a></sup> (Table S5). This variant is known to be more transmissible and to be associated with a higher case fatality rate than previous strains. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> Vaccine efficacy was greater than that associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) (70.4%) in a smaller phase 2–3 trial. <sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【55】Although the trial was not powered to assess efficacy for all the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, it is reassuring that substantial efficacy was shown against all the strains that were detected in the trial participants. In particular, the efficacy estimate of 96.4% against the non-B.1.1.7 strains (the majority of which were the prototype strain <sup><a>17 </a></sup> ) is similar to the efficacy of 95.0% reported against this strain for the BNT161b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer) and the efficacy of 94.1% for the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna). <sup><a>3,4 </a></sup> The vaccine efficacy was also greater than that reported for the adenoviral vector vaccines. <sup><a>5,6 </a></sup> Finally, as assessed elsewhere, <sup><a>18 </a></sup> the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine has also shown efficacy against the B.1.351 variant, albeit at a lower level (51.0%) than has been shown for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 strains.\n\n【56】Prevention of severe disease (including hospitalization, intensive care admission, and death) is an important objective of a vaccination program, and the two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine showed very high efficacy against this end point, similar to that reported for other licensed Covid-19 vaccines. <sup><a>3-6 </a></sup> In addition, although this trial was not designed to assess vaccine efficacy after a single dose, NVX-CoV2373 provided levels of protection after the first dose in a range similar to those of other Covid-19 vaccines. <sup><a>3-6 </a></sup> The favorable safety profile that was observed during phase 1–2 studies of NVX-CoV2373 was confirmed in this phase 3 trial. Reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate, and reactions were less common and milder in older participants and more common after the second dose. Injection-site tenderness and pain, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain were the most commonly reported local and systemic adverse events. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups (0.5% in each), and no deaths were attributed to the receipt of the vaccine.\n\n【57】This trial has several limitations. Although approximately 7500 participants received NVX-CoV2373, it is not possible to exclude the occurrence of rare adverse events. However, such events may be captured through the ongoing follow-up of participants, which is planned to continue until 12 months after the administration of the second dose of vaccine and is also being assessed in the larger PREVENT-19 phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04611802 . opens in new tab ). The PREVENT-19 trial was also able to enroll a larger number of participants in racial and ethnic minority groups, whereas only 5.7% of participants in the current trial were non-White. Similarly, the efficacy estimates reported here are derived from a relatively short duration of observation (median, 3 months after dose 2). Thus, the ongoing follow-up will provide data regarding the durability of vaccine efficacy, a continued assessment of severe cases, and an assessment of efficacy against asymptomatic disease. A further limitation of the current trial is the lack of sequencing data on viral isolates, although the use of S-gene target failure, as detected by the TaqPath assay, has proved to be a reliable proxy for the presence of B.1.1.7 variants.\n\n【58】The results of this trial provide further evidence that immunization with a protein-based, adjuvanted vaccine such as NVX-CoV2373 can prevent Covid-19 caused by either B.1.1.7 or non-B.1.1.7 variants. In addition, NVX-CoV2373 can be stored at standard refrigeration temperatures and has the potential to induce a broad epitope response to the spike protein antigen. Both of these attributes are important for the efficient implementation of this vaccine globally in view of the continued need to vaccinate against emerging variants.\n\n【59】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【60】Supported by Novavax .

We therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of acyclovir for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of renal allografts from cadavers. Acyclovir was given orally in doses of 800 to 3200 mg per day, according to the patients' estimated level of renal function. Patients took the first dose of either acyclovir or placebo six hours before transplantation and continued to take the assigned medication for 12 weeks. Of 118 patients enrolled in the study, 104 completed at least 30 days on the study medication and were included in our analysis of the results.\n\n【2】During the first year after transplantation, 4 of 53 patients (7.5 percent) in the acyclovir group had symptomatic cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with 15 of 51 (29 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.002). There was a single case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in the acyclovir group, as compared with nine in the placebo group. The greatest prophylactic benefit of acyclovir was observed among seronegative patients who had received a kidney from a seropositive donor; only one of six such patients in the acyclovir group had cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with all seven in the placebo group. Acyclovir decreased the incidence of documented cytomegalovirus infection (with or without symptomatic disease) to 36 percent from 61 percent among the patients who received the placebo (P = 0.011). Among the patients who received acyclovir, the rates of recovery of virus from the blood and urine were significantly reduced, but the rate of viral shedding from the pharynx was not significantly different from that in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events or in the rate of survival of either grafts or patients.\n\n【3】We conclude that the oral administration of acyclovir, beginning before the transplantation of a renal allograft from a cadaver, reduces the rate of cytomegalovirus infection and disease without affecting the survival rate of either grafts or patients.

We evaluated three new regimens for latent tuberculosis that may be more potent and durable than standard isoniazid treatment.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned South African adults with HIV infection and a positive tuberculin skin test who were not taking antiretroviral therapy to receive rifapentine (900 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) weekly for 12 weeks, rifampin (600 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) twice weekly for 12 weeks, isoniazid (300 mg) daily for up to 6 years (continuous isoniazid), or isoniazid (300 mg) daily for 6 months (control group). The primary end point was tuberculosis-free survival.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The 1148 patients had a median age of 30 years and a median CD4 cell count of 484 per cubic millimeter. Incidence rates of active tuberculosis or death were 3.1 per 100 person-years in the rifapentine–isoniazid group, 2.9 per 100 person-years in the rifampin–isoniazid group, and 2.7 per 100 person-years in the continuous-isoniazid group, as compared with 3.6 per 100 person-years in the control group (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Serious adverse reactions were more common in the continuous-isoniazid group (18.4 per 100 person-years) than in the other treatment groups (8.7 to 15.4 per 100 person-years). Two of 58 isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (3.4%) were found to have multidrug resistance.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】On the basis of the expected rates of tuberculosis in this population of HIV-infected adults, all secondary prophylactic regimens were effective. Neither a 3-month course of intermittent rifapentine or rifampin with isoniazid nor continuous isoniazid was superior to 6 months of isoniazid. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00057122 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection and the leading cause of death in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), especially in Africa, where tuberculosis rates have increased sharply in the past two decades. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> Previous trials have shown that preventive treatment of HIV-infected patients with isoniazid for 6 to 12 months or a combination of isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months reduces the risk of tuberculosis by 32 to 64%. <sup><a>2-6 </a></sup> Despite this evidence and a World Health Organization policy endorsing routine use of isoniazid, the number of programs providing preventive treatment against tuberculosis is exceedingly low. <sup><a>1,7,8 </a></sup> Concerns about low completion rates, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> the potential for reinfection, <sup><a>10,11 </a></sup> and selection of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains <sup><a>12 </a></sup> contribute to the reluctance of public health programs to implement preventive treatment widely.\n\n【12】To address these concerns, we studied the use of 12-week courses of rifapentine given weekly or rifampin given twice weekly, both with isoniazid. The choice of these regimens was based on evidence of increased potency and improved adherence. <sup><a>13-16 </a></sup> We also studied continuously administered isoniazid, which may be more potent than shorter courses and may prevent reinfection in areas where tuberculosis transmission is common.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】The protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved by the institutional review boards of Johns Hopkins Medicine and the University of the Witwatersrand, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Investigational New Drug Application 62,611), and the Medicines Control Council of South Africa. The protocol was designed by the authors, and all data were collected by the authors and study staff in Soweto, South Africa. The authors made the decision to submit the article for publication and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data presented and the adherence of the study and this report to the protocol.\n\n【16】Patients\n--------\n\n【17】The study was conducted in Soweto, a community with a high prevalence of HIV infection and tuberculosis. HIV-infected adults with an induration that was 5 mm or more in diameter in response to a tuberculin skin test were screened for enrollment from September 2002 through June 2005. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, were not pregnant or breast-feeding, and did not have active tuberculosis, as ruled out on the basis of symptom review, chest radiography, and, if indicated, sputum culture. Patients were also excluded if they had ever received tuberculosis therapy for more than 2 months, were currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, or had a CD4 cell count of less than 200 per cubic millimeter. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\n【18】Treatment Groups and Administration\n-----------------------------------\n\n【19】This was an open-label, randomized trial of rifapentine (Priftin, Sanofi Aventis; 900 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) once weekly for 12 weeks (rifapentine–isoniazid), rifampin (600 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) twice weekly for 12 weeks (rifampin–isoniazid), isoniazid (300 mg) daily for the duration of the study (≤6 years) (continuous isoniazid), or a control regimen of isoniazid (300 mg) daily for 6 months (6-month isoniazid). All patients received pyridoxine (25 mg) with each dose of antituberculosis medication. Treatment in the rifapentine–isoniazid and rifampin–isoniazid groups was directly observed in the study clinic, whereas in the 6-month–isoniazid and continuous-isoniazid groups, the study drugs were self-administered. Treatment allocation was by a computer-generated algorithm that randomly assigned patients in blocks of 2:2:2:1 to the rifapentine–isoniazid, rifampin–isoniazid, 6-month–isoniazid, and continuous-isoniazid groups, respectively.\n\n【20】Study Procedures\n----------------\n\n【21】During the treatment period, scheduled visits occurred once weekly for the rifapentine–isoniazid group and twice weekly for the rifampin–isoniazid group, every 2 weeks for the first 6 months for the two isoniazid groups, and monthly thereafter for the continuous-isoniazid group. Patients who had completed the assigned study regimen or had discontinued it were seen every 6 months until the end of the trial.\n\n【22】At each study visit, patients were screened for tuberculosis symptoms by a study nurse. For those with symptoms, assessment of a sputum smear, mycobacterial culture, and chest radiography were performed. The National Health Laboratory Service in Johannesburg, South Africa, performed the mycobacterial culture and drug-sensitivity testing using a mycobacterial-testing system (BACTEC mycobacterial growth indicator tube \\[MGIT\\] 960, BD). Species determination was achieved by means of nucleic acid amplification (AccuProbe, Gen-Probe), and drug-susceptibility testing was conducted with the use of critical concentrations of isoniazid and rifampin in MGIT culture.\n\n【23】Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were measured in all patients 1, 2, and 6 months after randomization, as well as every 6 months thereafter in the continuous-isoniazid group. CD4 cell counts were measured every 6 months, and CD4 cell counts and HIV viral loads were measured every 3 months in patients whose CD4 cell count was less than 350 per cubic millimeter beginning in the second quarter of 2004. Patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy were referred to an HIV clinic for the initiation of such therapy but remained in the study. The first-line antiretroviral regimen in use in South Africa during the trial consisted of stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz or nevirapine. Women who became pregnant while receiving rifapentine–isoniazid or rifampin–isoniazid were switched to the 6-month–isoniazid group, and treatment was stopped after they had received isoniazid for a total of 6 months. All patients who discontinued therapy were followed until the end of the study.\n\n【24】Study End Points\n----------------\n\n【25】The primary end point was tuberculosis-free survival. Cases were classified as confirmed, probable, or possible tuberculosis. Confirmed tuberculosis was defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and a positive culture for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from any site. Probable tuberculosis was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms with acid-fast bacilli in a sputum smear or caseous necrosis in a tissue-biopsy specimen. Possible tuberculosis was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms without microbiologic or histologic evidence of _M. tuberculosis_ but with a clinical response to antituberculosis therapy.\n\n【26】Patients who had signs and symptoms of tuberculosis without microbiologic or biopsy confirmation and without a clinical response to therapy were categorized as having “suspected tuberculosis,” but these cases were not counted as events. Diagnosed cases of tuberculosis and deaths were ascertained through active follow-up of patients who missed scheduled visits. Clinical records and death certificates were obtained whenever possible. An independent end-point committee reviewed and categorized all end points.\n\n【27】The secondary outcomes of the study were adherence to the study regimen, adverse events, discontinuation of study medication for any reason, and mycobacterial drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis. Serious adverse events were defined as grade 3 or 4 adverse events according to the Division of AIDS toxicity table, hospitalization, or death. Pregnancy also was reported as a serious adverse event but was not analyzed as such.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】Patients with confirmed, probable, or possible tuberculosis and those who died were included in the intention-to-treat analyses of the primary end point. The trial was originally designed to show the superiority of the three new regimens for preventing tuberculosis over the standard therapy of isoniazid for 6 months. We assumed that the annual risk of tuberculosis would be 6% in the 6-month isoniazid group, on the basis of data from trials conducted elsewhere in Africa <sup><a>8,9 </a></sup> ; that the rifapentine–isoniazid and rifampin–isoniazid regimens would reduce the incidence of tuberculosis by 50%, to 3% per year, on the basis of studies in animals <sup><a>17,18 </a></sup> ; and that the continuous-isoniazid regimen would reduce the incidence by 82%, to 1.1% per year, by preventing reinfection.\n\n【30】With a minimum of 3 years of follow-up per patient, we anticipated a total of 124 tuberculosis cases among the 1148 study patients. The probability of a type I error was set at 0.05, and the power of the study was estimated at 90%. Incidence-rate ratios and corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals for tuberculosis and for tuberculosis or death were calculated, after censoring of data for patients lost to follow-up. The primary statistical analysis was performed with the use of the log-rank test. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. A formal interim analysis of efficacy with respect to the tuberculosis end point, with the use of the O'Brien–Fleming alpha spending function, <sup><a>9 </a></sup> was planned at the time of 50% accrual of cases and took place when there was a total of 51 tuberculosis cases; tests were performed with a significance level of 0.006 for each of the three pairwise comparisons with the 6-month–isoniazid group. <sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【31】On the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring board, which was concerned that patients might die of tuberculosis before it was diagnosed, the follow-up period was extended, and the primary end point was changed to tuberculosis or death. A second interim analysis was conducted when there were 115 events for this end point, with tests at a significance level of 0.02. At the end of the study, there were 128 events, with a final test at a significance level of about 0.04.\n\n【32】An as-treated analysis was performed with data for patients who had received more than 2 months of study therapy and who did not have tuberculosis in the first 3-month period after randomization. Data for participants who discontinued their study therapy prematurely were censored 60 days after the medication was stopped to ensure that end points that might have led to discontinuation were included.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Study Participants and Follow-up\n--------------------------------\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Recruitment and Randomization of Study Patients.\n\n【36】Patients could have more than one reason for ineligibility.Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Patients, According to Treatment Group.\n\n【37】From September 2002 through June 2005, a total of 1528 tuberculin-positive, HIV-infected adults were screened; 1176 (77.0%) were eligible for the study, of whom 1150 (97.8%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a study regimen ( Figure 1 ). The main reasons for nonenrollment were eligibility for antiretroviral therapy (170 patients) and diagnosis of active tuberculosis during the screening process (90 patients). The median age of patients was 30.4 years, and 83.3% were women. The median CD4 cell count was 484 per cubic millimeter, the log <sub>10 </sub> HIV viral load was 4.2 copies per milliliter, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. The baseline characteristics were balanced among the four treatment groups ( Table 1 ).\n\n【38】The median follow-up time was 4.0 years in the rifapentine–isoniazid group, 4.1 years in the rifampin–isoniazid group, 3.9 years in the continuous-isoniazid group, and 3.9 years in the 6-month–isoniazid group. At the end of the study, 887 of the 1148 patients (77.3%) had been seen in the previous 6 months or had a known date of death. During the follow-up period, 215 patients (18.7%) were started on antiretroviral therapy; the median CD4 cell count at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy was 185 per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 148 to 234). Cumulatively, patients received antiretroviral therapy for less than 10% of total follow-up time.\n\n【39】Adherence\n---------\n\n【40】The proportions of patients who reported taking or were observed taking more than 90% of their assigned doses of study medication in the time allotted were 95.7% in the rifapentine–isoniazid group, 94.8% in the rifampin–isoniazid group, and 83.8% in the 6-month–isoniazid group. Patients in the continuous-isoniazid group took isoniazid for 89.1% of the total follow-up time; 60.4% of patients received daily isoniazid for more than 3 years, and 43.3% for more than 4 years. The median duration of receipt of continuous isoniazid was 3.3 years (interquartile range, 2.1 to 4.3). Other data regarding study completion and adherence over time are shown in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix (available at NEJM.org).\n\n【41】Tuberculosis Cases and Deaths\n-----------------------------\n\n【42】Table 2. Table 2. Rates of Study End Points According to Treatment Group. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Risk of Tuberculosis or Death in the Intention-to-Treat Population, According to Treatment Group.\n\n【43】The four treatment regimens were rifapentine and isoniazid weekly for 12 weeks, rifampin and isoniazid twice a week for 12 weeks, isoniazid daily for up to 6 years (continuous regimen), and isoniazid daily for 6 months (control regimen).\n\n【44】Numbers and rates of cases of tuberculosis, death, or either event are shown in Table 2 . Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 78 patients, of whom 62 (79%) had confirmed tuberculosis, 11 (14%) had probable tuberculosis, and 5 (6%) had possible tuberculosis. The overall incidence of all tuberculosis was 1.9 cases per 100 person-years. There were 66 deaths during the follow-up period, for an overall incidence of 1.6 deaths per 100 person-years. There were no significant differences in the incidences of tuberculosis or death between any of the three groups treated with the newer regimens and the control group (P>0.05 for all comparisons, by the log-rank test). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the risk of reaching the primary end point (tuberculosis or death) in the intention-to-treat population are shown in Figure 2 .\n\n【45】A post hoc, as-treated analysis included data from patients who had received the assigned study therapy for at least 2 months, with data censored 60 days after premature discontinuation of the regimen. Because of the high rates of treatment completion in the three groups with the shortest treatment phase, most censoring occurred in the continuous-isoniazid group. Thus, most of the follow-up data for the groups treated with the shorter regimens were obtained after the completion of therapy, whereas most of the follow-up data for the continuous-isoniazid group were collected while the patients were receiving therapy. The rate of tuberculosis or death was much lower in the continuous-isoniazid group than in the other three groups in this analysis. In a Cox proportional-hazards analysis, the continuous-isoniazid group had a risk of tuberculosis or death that was 58% lower than the risk in the control group (P=0.02). The rate of tuberculosis escalated markedly after discontinuation of continuous-isoniazid treatment.\n\n【46】Discontinuation of Therapy, Adverse Events, and Drug Resistance\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The leading reasons for stopping preventive treatment were pregnancy (accounting for 34 patients), initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (27 patients, all in the continuous-isoniazid group), and withdrawal from the study because of work responsibilities (14 patients).\n\n【48】Table 3.  Table 3. Adverse Events, Including Those Occurring after Discontinuation of Study Medications, and Status of Study Medications after the Adverse Events.\n\n【49】The types and rates of adverse events are shown in Table 3 . For the three shorter regimens, almost all adverse events occurred after completion of treatment, whereas 87.3% of adverse events in the continuous-isoniazid group occurred during the medication phase. Rates of serious adverse events (grade 3 or 4 toxic effects, death, and active tuberculosis) while patients were receiving the study drugs were 8.7 per 100 person-years in the rifapentine–isoniazid group, 10.6 per 100 person-years in the rifampin–isoniazid group, 18.4 per 100 person-years in the continuous-isoniazid group, and 15.4 per 100 person-years in the 6-month–isoniazid group (P>0.05 for all comparisons with the 6-month–isoniazid group). There were no deaths attributed to a study drug. A grade 3 or 4 elevation in the aspartate or alanine aminotransferase level occurred during the treatment phase in 1.5%, 2.4%, 28.0%, and 5.5% of patients in the rifapentine–isoniazid, rifampin–isoniazid, continuous-isoniazid, and 6-month–isoniazid groups, respectively (P<0.001 for the comparison of continuous isoniazid with 6-month isoniazid). The median time from randomization to the first detected grade 3 or 4 elevation in the aminotransferase level was 47 days (interquartile range, 36 to 57), 28 days (interquartile range, 8 to 68), 571 days (interquartile range, 358 to 674), and 175 days (interquartile range, 56 to 182) in the rifapentine–isoniazid, rifampin–isoniazid, continuous-isoniazid, and 6-month–isoniazid groups, respectively.\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Cases of Tuberculosis, Culture-Confirmed Cases, and Drug-Resistant Isolates, According to Treatment Group.\n\n【51】Drug-susceptibility testing was performed in 58 of 62 _M. tuberculosis_ isolates (94%). Two cases of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and three cases of rifampin-resistant tuberculosis were detected. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin) was detected in 2 of the isolates (3%), 1 from a patient in the rifapentine–isoniazid group and the other from a patient in the continuous-isoniazid group ( Table 4 ).\n\n【52】Discussion\n----------\n\n【53】We found that three new prophylactic regimens against tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults were not superior to the control regimen of isoniazid therapy for 6 months. The overall rate of tuberculosis was 1.9 cases per 100 person-years, with no significant difference between any of the three new regimens and the control regimen. Among HIV-infected people in Africa with a positive tuberculin skin test who are not receiving antituberculosis treatment, the expected annual rate of tuberculosis ranges from 5 and 10%. <sup><a>2,4,6,7 </a></sup> The rate of tuberculosis in the control group was also substantially lower than anticipated, suggesting that all the treatments used in this study performed better than regimens used in earlier African studies. <sup><a>10,11 </a></sup> The shorter, rifamycin-based regimens had higher adherence rates than did the 6-month isoniazid regimen and did not appear to select for drug-resistant _M. tuberculosis_ in the small number of isolates cultured. These results are consistent with an earlier study showing the efficacy of daily isoniazid and rifampin in adults with HIV infection, <sup><a>2 </a></sup> but we found that a twice-weekly regimen was also efficacious.\n\n【54】No clinically significant safety concerns were identified with the once-weekly regimen of rifapentine and isoniazid in our study, a finding that is similar to the results of a smaller trial involving household contacts of patients with tuberculosis in Brazil. <sup><a>14 </a></sup> A recent, large trial of this regimen as compared with 9 months of isoniazid in a population largely uninfected with HIV showed noninferiority, which is consistent with our results. <sup><a>20 </a></sup> The use of intermittent, short-course rifamycin regimens to prevent tuberculosis is appealing because adherence is improved, therapy can be supervised, and adverse reactions should be minimized. Use of rifamycins is problematic in patients receiving HIV protease inhibitors, which are metabolized by P-450 cytochromes, but concomitant use of rifampin and efavirenz does not appear to compromise antiviral activity. <sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【55】We found no additional benefit of continuous isoniazid as compared with 6 months of isoniazid as preventive treatment in our intention-to-treat analysis. Our study was not blinded, however, and patients assigned to continuous isoniazid discontinued treatment for a number of reasons. Our post hoc analyses suggest that continuous isoniazid was effective while patients were taking the drug but that its effectiveness was lost when treatment ended. Hepatotoxic adverse events were more common with continuous isoniazid than with the 6-month regimen, but none of these events were fatal. Our results support data from a trial in Botswana comparing a 3-year course of isoniazid therapy with the 6-month regimen, in which the longer regimen was superior. <sup><a>22 </a></sup> The Botswana trial was placebo-controlled, and the rate of treatment discontinuation with prolonged isoniazid treatment was lower in that study than in ours. Taken together, these data suggest that longer courses of isoniazid are efficacious but that the benefit will be compromised by discontinuation of treatment and adverse events.\n\n【56】Adherence to antituberculosis therapy was good in our trial, a finding that is consistent with reports from African programs showing that 70 to 90% of HIV-infected adults given isoniazid completed treatment. <sup><a>23,24 </a></sup> In our trial, adherence to the three shorter regimens was better than adherence to continuous isoniazid.\n\n【57】Intermittent rifapentine therapy for active tuberculosis in patients with advanced HIV infection has been associated with the emergence of organisms that are resistant to rifampin. <sup><a>25 </a></sup> Overall, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in our study was 3.4%, which is similar to estimates in South Africa at the time of our study. <sup><a>26 </a></sup> We did not detect increased selection of resistant organisms, probably because of the reduced bacterial load in latent tuberculosis; however, our sample was small.\n\n【58】The prevalence of active tuberculosis was 5.9% among the adults screened for this trial, which is similar to the prevalence among HIV-infected patients in South Africa and other areas with a high burden of tuberculosis when they begin to receive antiretroviral therapy <sup><a>27,28 </a></sup> or prenatal care. <sup><a>29 </a></sup> The World Health Organization has recently revised its guidelines for antituberculosis therapy <sup><a>30 </a></sup> to recommend the use of isoniazid for all HIV-infected persons at high risk for tuberculosis, including pregnant women, children, and patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, regardless of tuberculin status. We studied only HIV-infected adults with a positive tuberculin skin test, who account for up to 50% of HIV-infected patients in southern Africa and make up a group at particularly high risk for the development of tuberculosis; thus, our results may not be generalizable to lower-risk groups.\n\n【59】In summary, short-course, rifamycin-based preventive treatment had similar, not superior, efficacy to 6 months of isoniazid in tuberculin-positive adults infected with HIV. Use of these regimens in clinical practice could substantially increase the number of patients who receive and complete preventive therapy. Our findings, along with those of other investigators, <sup><a>22 </a></sup> suggest that continuous treatment with isoniazid may be effective in preventing reactivation of and reinfection with _M. tuberculosis_ in Africa. More widespread use of preventive therapy, regardless of the regimen chosen, is essential to help control the epidemic of HIV-related tuberculosis.\n\n【60】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【61】Supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (AI048526 and AI01637), the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center (D43 TW000010-21S1 and 5U2RTW007370), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (GHS-A-00-03-00019-00).\n\n【62】Dr. Martinson reports receiving lecture fees from Alere.\n\n【63】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【64】No other potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\n\n【65】We thank the women and men who participated in the study; Professors Alan Karstaedt and Michelle Wong, who served as the end-point committee; Drs.

For the past week, the hospital census has been over 90% of capacity, and almost all usual intensive care unit (ICU) beds have been occupied, more than half with patients who have Covid-19. You are using 10% of the ICU surge capacity created by your hospital to accommodate patients with Covid-19. The hospital has limited personal protective equipment (PPE) available, although supplies are adequate for current use. The 7-day average for daily new cases of Covid-19 in your region is 30 cases per 100,000 people; the rate is rising but has fluctuated for the past week. Hospitals in neighboring regions have similar capacities and limited availability to accept transfers of patients with Covid-19 from other hospitals. The local government has mandated that people wear face masks in public, but there is no stay-at-home order.\n\n【5】Your committee must decide whether elective surgical procedures should be deferred. In determining your recommendation to the committee, you will have to consider the effect that deferring these procedures will have on hospital revenue, as well as the potential negative health consequences to patients whose surgery will be delayed; however, you must also consider the effect that proceeding with these surgeries will have on bed capacity, staffing (since physicians and nurses may need to be redeployed if Covid-19 cases continue to rise), the limited supplies of PPE, and patients’ risk of contracting or transmitting Covid-19 while they are in the hospital for the elective procedure.\n\n【6】Treatment Options\n-----------------\n\n【7】Which one of the following approaches would you take? Base your choice on the published literature, your own experience, published guidelines, and other information sources.\n\n【8】1.  Continue to schedule elective surgical procedures.\n    \n2.  Defer all elective surgical procedures.\n    \n3.  Proceed with scheduled elective surgical procedures but defer new cases.\n\n【9】To aid in your decision making, each of these approaches is defended in a short essay by an expert in the field. Given your knowledge of the issue and the points made by the experts, which approach would you choose?\n\n【10】1.  Option 1 : Continue to Schedule Elective Surgical Procedures\n2.  Option 2 : Defer All Elective Surgical Procedures\n3.  Option 3 : Proceed with Scheduled Elective Surgical Procedures but Defer New Cases\n\n【11】*   Option 1\n*   Option 2\n*   Option 3\n\n【12】### Continue to Schedule Elective Surgical Procedures\n\n【13】Craig R. Smith, M.D.\n\n【14】In the scenario described in the vignette, it is perfectly reasonable to continue scheduling elective surgical procedures. The vignette states that the rate of new Covid-19 cases is 30 cases per day per 100,000 people, expressed as a 7-day average. This describes the situation in many regions in the United States, except New York City at its peak in April 2020, when the rate was more than twice as high. <sup><a>1 </a></sup> The description of the 7-day average for daily new cases as “fluctuating” for the past week implies a slowing of the rate of increase in new cases, even if the number of cases is still rising. The effect of these new cases on hospital resources depends on the population the hospital serves and on regional factors, such as population density and the macroenvironment, which in this scenario is not locked down. A high rate of new cases is also less worrisome for a hospital that is large for its regional population, as might be the case for a tertiary referral center.\n\n【15】The hospital in this scenario has been dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic long enough to have built substantial surge capacity, which suggests that the rate of new cases is several weeks mature and close to a manageable plateau. As a point of reference, New York–Presbyterian Hospital required almost 3 weeks to create substantial surge capacity. <sup><a>2 </a></sup> The vignette specifies that the burden of the pandemic to date has filled only half the hospital’s existing ICU beds with patients who are positive for Covid-19, and 90% of the surge capacity remains unused. Supplies of PPE are said to be limited, but that is a universal truth, and they have been declared adequate for current use in this scenario. In addition, bed capacity and supply of PPE are easily monitored.\n\n【16】For persons with nonacute elective cases, such as those defined as low-acuity by the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS) used by the American College of Surgeons, <sup><a>3 </a></sup> the risk of nosocomial coronavirus infection is important to consider. Columbia University Irving Medical Center of the New York–Presbyterian Hospital studied the incidence of nosocomial Covid-19 infection from March 1 through April 27, 2020, in two patient-care units restricted to Covid-19–negative patients (a cardiothoracic ICU and a regular floor unit). Health care–associated transmission and infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 0 to 2% of 311 patients. <sup><a>4,5 </a></sup> The units studied were surrounded by units — adjacent, above, and below — filled with Covid-19–positive patients. The study period also encompassed the worst of the Covid-19 surge and plateau in New York City, and mitigation of infection was seriously compromised, at least in March, by shortages of PPE. Despite these factors, the risk of nosocomial infection was found to be notably low.\n\n【17】Finally, continuing or resuming the scheduling of elective surgical procedures in this scenario is reasonable because canceling them later, if necessary, poses little difficulty. Whereas cancellation of emergency surgery may cause patients harm, an abrupt change of course causing cancellation of elective procedures imposes inconvenience but no serious risk to patients. Most patients undergoing elective surgical procedures do not need ICU beds and intensive nursing support, and the rapid turnover of elective surgery cases also minimizes the extra pressure on resources. Nevertheless, daily monitoring of all relevant factors is essential if any type of surgery is allowed to continue. In addition to new case rates and the associated burden on the hospital and ICU, hospital staffing is another weak link. We can’t assume that staff can be driven through elective schedules the way they drove themselves through an extraordinary crisis.\n\n【18】Disclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【20】From the Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.\n\n【21】### Defer All Elective Surgical Procedures\n\n【22】Bradley T. Lembcke, M.D.\n\n【23】Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, professional societies and national organizations in the United States have offered guidance related to elective procedures, initially calling for their cancellation and later issuing guidance for their resumption. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has offered guidance on optimizing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the basis of anticipated inventory and demand. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> The CDC also offers strong guidance to the public about ways to protect against Covid-19 and to health care providers about ways to safely care for patients who do not have Covid-19 and prevent the further spread of the disease. <sup><a>8,9 </a></sup> When applied to this case scenario, these guidelines support the decision to defer elective surgeries.\n\n【24】First, let’s define elective procedures. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) supports the use of the ESAS, <sup><a>3 </a></sup> which defines low- and intermediate-acuity procedures as those that can be safely delayed without substantial risk to the patient. High-acuity cases should not be postponed. If we assume that the elective procedures in this case scenario are of low or intermediate acuity according to the ESAS, guidance provided by the ACS supports deferring them as long as the assessment is in alignment with clinical judgment.\n\n【25】Next, we should recognize that elective procedures involve the use of a substantial amount of PPE, as well as hospital resources such as beds and staff, and increase the risk of exposure for other patients and staff. In the vignette, PPE is described as limited and cases in the community are rising. The hospital is nearing total capacity, especially in the ICU, and surge capacity is already being utilized. The guidelines mentioned above, when applied to factors such as PPE, case counts, hospital and staff capacity, and patient and staff exposures, help inform the decision to defer elective surgeries.\n\n【26】Deferring elective procedures will ensure that our frontline providers have adequate PPE, since supplies are limited. We anticipate shortages of this equipment as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. To conserve PPE, we should follow the CDC contingency capacity guidelines, which call for the cancellation of elective cases. <sup><a>7 </a></sup> The American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, and American Hospital Association call for a sustained reduction in cases for 14 days before resumption of elective surgeries. <sup><a>6 </a></sup> In the vignette, the community case counts are described as still rising. The hospital is near capacity and anticipates further demands. Ensuring adequate bed capacity is another reason that CDC guidelines call for deferral of elective procedures. <sup><a>9 </a></sup> With the prevalence of Covid-19 rising, we should minimize the risk of exposure for patients and staff. We need to emphasize safe behaviors, which include adhering to disciplined social distancing and minimizing the need for in-person services. <sup><a>8,9 </a></sup> Deferring elective procedures protects both patients and staff from unnecessary exposure to Covid-19 and risk of illness.\n\n【27】We must be able to care for the urgent needs of our community and provide adequate resources to our health care providers before scheduling procedures that can be safely delayed. This means ensuring adequate PPE, adequate staffing, and adequate beds. It also means minimizing unnecessary risks of exposure. Deferring elective surgeries will increase the likelihood that we can meet those demands while keeping our patients, staff, and communities safe.\n\n【28】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【29】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【30】From Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center, Houston, and Catholic Health Initiatives Texas Division.\n\n【31】### Proceed with Scheduled Elective Surgical Procedures but Defer New Cases\n\n【32】Tanira B.D. Ferreira, M.D.\n\n【33】In March 2020, the American College of Surgeons recommended the cancellation of elective surgical procedures to ensure the availability of beds for patients with Covid-19, conserve PPE, and allow staff reallocation. <sup><a>3 </a></sup> Since then, the adverse outcomes in patients whose care was deferred and the financial implications for hospitals have become evident. <sup><a>10 </a></sup> As many institutions prepared to resume elective procedures in May 2020, a second Covid-19 surge occurred in the United States, affecting various regions differently. Institutions now face the burden of deciding how to proceed with surgical procedures in the absence of a unified national public health policy to mandate mask use and social distancing and with a poorly designed contact-tracing program.\n\n【34】The vignette describes a hospital at 90% capacity, with high occupancy in the ICU, in a community with 30 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people per day. As of August 27, cumulative data from the CDC show that there were 1769 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people, with a hospitalization rate of 156.8 per 100,000 people, which implies that 8.9% of cases result in hospitalization. <sup><a>11,12 </a></sup> Although these are national data, institutions can use their regional Covid-19 data as a basic model for the expected effect on their hospitals. Calculations that use data from the CDC show that for the hospital in the vignette, 2.61 cases per day will result in hospitalization. Guidelines from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend planning for 20% of hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19 to be admitted to the ICU, with an average stay of 7 days. <sup><a>13 </a></sup> Therefore, assuming that 0.52 patients per day will need ICU care for 7 days, this hospital will typically need 3.64 (0.52 new patients per day times 7 days) ICU beds each day for patients with Covid-19 per 100,000 population. Data from 2009 show that there were 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 U.S. population, albeit with considerable regional variability. <sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【35】Postponing elective surgeries that have already been scheduled could result in considerably worse outcomes for the community. Hospitals have a duty to their communities, trainees, and employees in addition to their responsibility to the patients. Establishing a new normal that is clinically appropriate and fiscally responsible also allows hospitals to maintain financial viability. This “two-in-one” health system — one for Covid-19 and one for non–Covid-19 — that was developed during the surge should remain for the duration of the pandemic. New elective surgeries should be considered only when the rates of new cases of Covid-19 flatten and decline.\n\n【36】For elective procedures that have already been scheduled, priority should be given to cases for which a short length of stay is anticipated, cases that have same-day discharges, or time-sensitive surgeries in which patients are likely to have adverse outcomes from further delays. Scheduling surgeries at atypical times (e.g., on weekends) and expediting throughput and efficiency (e.g., using a dedicated discharge team) are critical to maintaining adequate operating room and ICU capacity. Since the number of admissions may fluctuate, models that can predict the number of admissions for Covid-19 and non–Covid-19 illness and can anticipate use of PPE are essential to the strategy.\n\n【37】At my institution in Miami, we test all patients with a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay for Covid-19 on admission and separate patients into Covid-19 and non–Covid-19 floors. All wards are capable of generating negative room pressure, as recommended by the CDC in their guidelines for health care personnel on Covid-19 infection prevention and control. <sup><a>15 </a></sup> This ensures flexibility between medical–surgical and ICU use for each unit. The surgical schedule is modified according to models that predict the number of new patients with Covid-19 who require admission. The Covid-19 surge described in the vignette is more favorable than the situation we faced in Miami in June and July 2020. <sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【38】Continuing scheduled elective surgeries but deferring new cases achieves the core goal of health care institutions — providing high quality, safe care to all patients regardless of their Covid-19 status. Achieving this goal requires a well-designed, comprehensive surge plan and a reliable model to predict demand and supply.\n\n【39】Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【40】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【41】From the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care Medicine, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami.\n\n【42】Poll\n----\n\n【43】Which option would you choose?\n\n【44】1.

The second ( or third ) wave of COVID 19 is upon us. Furthermore there is now a new variant whose behaviour is not yet fully identified. Therefore, its sensible to stop all elective operating to prepare for the worst case scenario as the remaining 10% of beds could be very easily filled by incoming COVID patients. Furthermore, this is not just about beds but also staff and equipment as well. It would be well wise at this point to consider only emergency and urgent cases.

Otherwise, all the elective surgical precedures should be scheduled. But, considering about the epidemic nature of COVID-19 patients, they should be strictly isolated whether they are with mild, mid or severe symptoms, even the asymptomatic cases shouled be quarantined rigrously.
